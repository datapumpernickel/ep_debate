During the parliamentary elections of 17 October 2004, very few opposition candidates were allowed to run and none of them were elected to parliament. The referendum to allow a third presidential term is said to have been won by a large majority of votes. The way is now open for President Lukashenko to put up his candidature for the presidential elections in 2006 and be elected for a third time, if not become president for life. If these presidential elections are conducted the same way as the elections and referendum of 17 October, there is no doubt that he will succeed in this.</p>
<p class="contents">In our declaration of 20 October 2004 we clearly condemned the voting process. We noted with great concern that the elections and referendum failed to meet the international standards for democratic elections. The OSCE/ODIHR preliminary findings are clear about what went wrong. The European Union is deeply disappointed that both during the election campaign and on election day there were concrete signs of the Belarussian authorities’ disregard for democratic rules. The extent and character of the irregularities observed by the OSCE International Election Observation Mission raise serious doubts whether the results reflect the will of the Belarussian electorate at all. Exit polls, which we consider to be more credible, suggest that this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">You probably all saw the subsequent pictures on television last week, of peaceful demonstrators and opposition leaders in Belarus being beaten up by police. We are very concerned about these violent attacks. These attacks, especially the attack on the life and health of opposition leader Lebedko, seem to have been well targeted and prepared. We call upon the Belarussian authorities to release immediately all those who were arrested in exercising their right to free speech, as provided by the constitution of Belarus. Needless to say, we also condemn the attacks on journalists, including Russian TV journalists, who tried to cover the demonstrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a neighbouring country where one man on his own decides what is best for the population. Opposition and independent media are repressed, democracy is a far cry. And this is not a new situation: the situation has existed since 1996 when President Lukashenko abrogated the elected parliament, and changed the constitution to invest all the executive powers in the president, i.e. his own person.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only in the interest of the Belarus people, but also in the European Union’s interest to have democracy, respect for human rights, peace, security and prosperity in this neighbouring country. So what can the European Union do to further developments in order to bring about a better life for the people of Belarus?</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1997, the European Union's relations with Belarus have been at a very low level. In that year the EU decided not to ratify the partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus, in view of the abrogation of democracy in 1996. All technical assistance was stopped except if promoting democracy or humanitarian aid. After the presidential elections of 2001, when Lukashenko was re-elected, the EU decided to continue its strict policy towards the regime, but at the same time to try to continue and – if possible – to expand relations with civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the situation is only getting worse. The popular support of President Lukashenko diminishes, and the regime – as a reaction – gets more and more oppressive. So what can the EU do about it, in terms of both carrots and sticks?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what has the EU to offer? In order to bring about an area of peace, security and prosperity the EU has developed the European Neighbourhood Policy. If Belarus decides to choose the path of democracy and rule of law, where the population decides on its own economic and political future, the EU is prepared to make Belarus the same offer as other neighbouring countries. Of course we should not offer this whilst Belarus is not making any changes.</p>
<p class="contents">But how big is this carrot? As prosperity in the new EU Member States neighbouring Belarus grows along with democratic stability, this may be expected to have a strong psychological effect on the people of Belarus. This will hopefully be an irreversible process.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistance to civil society is already a long-standing policy of the EU. But to bring about this support within the borders of Belarus is getting more and more difficult in practice. The regime is doing everything to prevent western support to non-governmental organisations. An alternative is to develop more activities for Belarus civil society outside Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The invitation of a number of opposition and civil society leaders to visit to Brussels in May is one example of this new policy. But more can be done, in the form of participation of Belarussians in seminars, courses and studies abroad. In the years ahead we should invest more in the Belarussian people in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very happy about the establishment of a separate delegation for Belarus in the European Parliament. This will give you as parliamentarians a chance to focus more on this neighbouring country and to establish your own contacts. I think that this step also proves to the Belarussians that the EU takes the situation in their country very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what negative measures can the EU take? Relations are already on a very low level. We have had sanctions in the form of a visa ban against the Belarus leaders in the past. Recently, we extended it to cover other high-level people. The only area that is still left aside is the economy and trade. Such a policy would clearly also hit the population as such, and will further isolate Belarus. President Lukashenko would argue that the population is worse off as a result of the EU’s action, not his own policy. Furthermore, the ordinary citizen will be worst hit. So it is I am afraid a double-edged sword. We have to be very careful when considering such steps.</p>
<p class="contents">The political developments in Belarus are of great concern not only to the EU, but also to others such as the OSCE and the US. If we give the signals together, our voice will be better heard. But we will also have to work together with Russia, which seems to be the only country to have some influence over Belarus. We therefore also raised the situation in Belarus at the ministerial troika with Minister Lavrov last week. Whilst the Russian government shares our concern about the situation, unfortunately we disagree about the way forward. The Russians do not want to maintain the strict policy that the EU is implementing. And that I deeply regret.</p>
<p class="contents">As I explained, the instruments available to the EU to influence developments are limited. But we will continue, as the EU, as individual Member States and through the OSCE, to try to influence the situation with these instruments and bring about a real improvement of the lives of the Belarus people.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the developments in Belarus are of great concern to the European Union. The European Union has a major interest in the stability, prosperity and democracy of its neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">It is deplorable that Belarus has not taken the opportunity of the October parliamentary elections to take positive steps towards democratic pluralism. On the contrary, the parliamentary elections on 17 October fell significantly short of OSCE commitments for democratic elections. The controversial referendum on the removal of the two-term limit on the office of the president failed to meet international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in the preliminary findings of the international Election Observation Mission of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the extent and the seriousness of irregularities during the electoral period and the voting day itself raise serious doubts as to whether the results of the elections fully reflect the will of the Belarussian electorate. Freedom of expression, association and assembly were seriously challenged. Election campaigning by the candidates was, in many ways, restricted. The state media conducted an extensive campaign in favour of the incumbent political forces, whilst portraying the opposition in overwhelmingly negative terms. Non-state print media had only a minor role to play. Access to independent information sources remains limited by the fact that all nation-wide radio and television channels are state-controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">In the days following the elections, the negative trend in the political climate in Belarus has persisted.</p>
<p class="contents">Since election day, the authorities have turned, in an increasingly harsh and intolerant manner, against those citizens who have challenged the outcome of the elections and referendum in peaceful street demonstrations. Many of those who have expressed themselves in public have been arrested or fined. Opposition leaders and journalists have been beaten up. It is extremely worrying that, time after time, dissident voices in Belarus are not listened to, but repressed by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">For better or for worse, Belarus is a neighbour country of the European Union, with important historical, cultural and social ties with the enlarged European Union. We cannot be indifferent to the future of our relations with this or any other country in our immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has developed a framework to reinforce further the relationship between the enlarged EU and its neighbours, including Belarus: the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), for which I happen to be responsible, for longer than expected.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Prodi has said, the aim of the ENP is to create a 'ring of friends'. A key principle of the 'ring of friends' we are forging is joint ownership. We cannot impose the policy on anyone, but we are ready to convince our neighbours of the benefits of the ENP. We are offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of our relations, from political dialogue to economic integration, on the basis of commitment to common values. This offer is also valid for Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the ENP, the European Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus. If and when fundamental political and economic reforms take place, it will be possible for Belarus to be fully involved in the ENP, with all the benefits that would bring. Under the current conditions, however, there can be no fully-fledged ENP action plan for Belarus. The October parliamentary elections and the referendum were an important milestone for Belarus under the ENP, but, unfortunately, Belarus failed to meet it. However, closer relations, including relations in the framework of the ENP, are still a possibility, provided that fundamental reforms are introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of fundamental reforms, one extremely important question remains: how should the democratic process in Belarus be further encouraged?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we believe in lasting engagement with the people of Belarus. At present, a key element in EU policy towards Belarus is support for civil society and the process of democratisation. The Commission wishes to pass a clear message to the Belarussian people, so that they know the EU has not forgotten them. The needs of the population should be addressed by way of technical assistance. People-to-people contacts between Belarus and the EU can be further fostered. The European Union is aiming to raise awareness of EU policies and assistance benefiting Belarussian citizens. I strongly believe that our new Member States in that region of Europe will help us to achieve our goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to use the assistance instruments at its disposal to continue support and assistance to civil society organisations, journalists and independent media, universities and, where appropriate, local authorities. Belarus will continue to be able to benefit from relevant regional, cross-border and thematic programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be mentioned, however, that the delivery of international assistance to civil society and independent media is far from easy. In the past few years Belarus has refused to grant tax exemptions for EU assistance, in breach of earlier commitments between Belarus and the European Union. Today, Belarus requires all foreign gratuitous aid projects to be registered by the state authorities, which allows them effectively to turn down any international assistance that they do not appreciate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we continue to monitor closely the state of human rights, respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the country and raise our concerns with the Belarussian Government. Based on information submitted by European trade union confederations, the Commission has launched an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the framework of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). Depending on the findings of the investigation, the EU will need to reconsider whether Belarus should have access to the benefits of the GSP scheme in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is important to take account of the long-term prospects. In the longer term, our proximity to Belarus could and should be translated into close cooperation and exchanges in fields of common interest, such as trade, justice and home affairs, transport, energy and the environment, provided that fundamental political reforms are carried out. The Commission wants to keep the door open for full participation in the ENP by a democratic Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by underlining again that it is important that the Belarussian people – and especially those striving for democratic change – are not left out in the cold.

Both of these ‘ifs’ are the particularly fragile props, on which we can only imagine Belarus as a bridge between the European Union and Russia. The Belorussian bridge would be needed by all three sides, and profitable for Belarus itself. However, first there has to exist a democratic, independent Belorussian state. At present Belarus is a semi-dependent protectorate, ruled by an autocratic dictator, supported by Russia. Those who believe that everything in Belarus, including the elections, depends only on Mr Lukashenko, are wrong. When we criticise only the rulers of Belarus, we are departing from reality. Since 1997 a Russia-Belarus union has formed, which is expanding in the direction of ever greater state amalgamation. And so Russia's responsibility must not be ignored. For instance Mr Lukashenko appointed General Ushopchik, a man wanted by the Court of Lithuania for the murder of unarmed civilians during the events in Vilnius in 1991, a Vice-Minister in today's Belorussian Government. We hope that Lukashenko made this political provocation without instruction from Moscow's advisers. But as for his friendship with the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, including arms trading, it is doubtful whether this could have been achieved without Moscow's approval. It seems that the present situation is useful to Russia. Were it not useful to Russia, the situation there would have changed long ago and the country would not be run by Lukashenko. But the protectorate is given to none other than Lukashenko. Not only to the country, but to the regime. The situation will change when Russia understands that this is not the most useful scenario for Russia either. Meanwhile an information centre on a democratic Belarus could already be operating now in Brussels, if the European Union were to help found it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This constitutional change would, in theory, make it possible for the current President, Mr Lukashenko, to remain in power for life. At the time, I called this an impending constitutional <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. Unfortunately, we have to conclude – and that is not the first time – that our appeal has been in vain. No attempt has been made by the authorities to repair the damage of previous violations of the rights of opposition candidates. Media coverage has been neither fair nor balanced, and the OSCE came to the conclusion that the parliamentary elections failed to meet international standards. This also applied to the campaign preceding the referendum. The outcome, a turnout of around 90%, 75% of whom voted in favour of the constitutional change, is shrouded in suspicion. The parliament is paralysed, not one single opposition candidate having been elected to it. Since the elections, small, but persistent, peaceful protests take place in Minsk almost every day, but absolutely all of them are violently quashed. This situation calls for a response. It should be made quite clear that, in the present situation, there is no room for reinforcing relations with the regime in Belarus. It should be absolutely clear to Mr Lukashenko that rapprochement is out of the question as long as the regime does not commit to making efforts with a view to bringing about democratic reforms. In those circumstances, Lukashenko will remain internationally isolated, but the force of this lever is limited. We must also try to help bring about changes for the better in Belarus by supporting the democratic opposition forces in that country. Last week, the American Congress adopted a Belarus Democracy Act, which takes measures to which Europe should also give consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have chaired the observation delegation during parliamentary and presidential elections in Belarus for several times now, and my frustration about the lack of change, despite all efforts on our part, is still very great. Policy proposed by the Council and Commission receives our unqualified support, but in my view, the key to change lies with Belarus’ other neighbour, not the EU, but Russia. I should like to urge the Council once again to take a firmer stand in talks with Moscow, for my experience has been only that, as soon as we declare the elections unlawful, a telegram would arrive from President Putin that very same day to congratulate Mr Lukashenko, for the umpteenth time, on successful elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the shadow of these elections, however, a referendum was held, aimed at amending the constitution and making it possible for Mr Lukashenko to remain in power in Belarus for the rest of his life. President Lukashenko prevented observers from monitoring this referendum, which was of enormous significance for him. It was therefore held without any kind of external checks. Its significance was due to the increased difficulty of rigging the results. In order for the referendum to be legally valid it was necessary not only for there to be a high turn-out, but also for over half of those entitled to vote to do so in favour of the proposals. According to independent investigations carried out by Gallup, these requirements were not met. There is therefore ample reason for neither this referendum nor Mr Lukashenko’s right to run for re-election to the post of president to be recognised, even though no independent observers were present.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Union’s policy, I believe it is worth noting that there is only a comparatively small chance of any sanctions imposed actually having an effect. Belarus is fast heading towards self-isolation, and is turning into a country that entirely disregards the influence of other countries. In view of this, the economic effect of such measures can also be only slight, and the impact of the promised aid and ‘Cooperation with Belarus’ programme will doubtless remain very limited too, as President Lukashenko regards them as a poisoned chalice. If this is the case, what else can be done? The most essential action required, as already mentioned in this House, is the building of civil society. This must be achieved not only through measures in Belarus itself, which could prove difficult, but by taking advantage of the opportunities provided by modern technology, including radio and television. The latter could convey certain values and attitudes to Belarus, even if the transmitters are located outside Belarus’ borders, as would be the case under the proposals put forward by the United States. Incidentally, and finally, it might be a good idea for EU actions of this kind to be synchronised and coordinated in some way with the US actions set out in recent decisions by Congress and the President. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the people who live in Belarus, such a thing is the stuff of dreams. We cannot fail to see that the European Union is continuing to look on while a Stalinist and dictatorial system comes into being on its doorstep, with a long list of violations of democratic and human rights, and a roll of victims that gets ever longer, day after day. Many people in Belarus resigned themselves to this long ago. If they can, they leave the country. There is no hope any more.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only by using methods of this sort that Lukashenko was able to secure power for himself. I am very far from satisfied with the statement by the Council and the Commission, which really has nothing new to offer. It is not true to say that a framework is in place; the fact of the matter is that there is only a piece of paper. There is not really a change in attitude, with a specific concentration on the situation in Belarus and consideration of which measures are feasible in order to support the opposition and civil society in that country. None of the actual instruments make that possible; they must be changed. That must go on the agenda now, for it is now that it is urgent, and not at some undefined time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to remind the House of Mr Marset Campos’ report on its behalf, which said in plain language what is now to be done. Only if Belarus is democratic can we ensure our own security. For that reason, I believe that we should be backing a democratic Belarus rather than playing the Russian card. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I agree with several of the critical observations contained in the OSCE report, for example that the political parties have had unequal access to television coverage. I also reject the use of violence of any kind, whether perpetrated by individuals or by the state authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, forget the apparent facts which proved so misleading in policy-making before the conflicts in Yugoslavia and in Iraq. Secondly, we should bear in mind that what we say about Minsk today will hold true for Kiev tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief, and it has already been stated before this House, that we all want Belarus to become a member of the European concert in a dignified manner. In my opinion, the way to aid this process is not to impose isolation, but to provide help for the ordinary Belarussian people. Belarussians should feel that the European Union is keen to see a stable and democratic neighbour on its eastern border, which respects the right to free elections. I believe that we will achieve this not by means of resolutions alone, but also by means of concrete actions, for example by stepping up aid for people in areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, by helping resolve the issues of migration and border protection, by facilitating greater communication between students and by supporting civil initiatives. These are all tools which may improve the situation for ordinary people, those for whom democracy is most important, in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, there can be no doubt that this situation is far from normal, and that it fails to meet our expectations with regard to the standards of a democratic state. Nonetheless, we stand by the statements we made on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group at the last part-session. As members of the League of Polish Families, we dispute the European Parliament’s right to interfere in the foreign policy of other countries, as it is not competent to do so. This House should concern itself with its own affairs instead of judging standards in other countries, especially ones that do not belong to the European Union, as such activities do not lie within its field of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">A parallel may be drawn here with Turkey, a country that has recently been the subject of much discussion. Turkey is a country that is occupying half of Cyprus. Turkey does not maintain diplomatic relations with Greece or Armenia. It persecutes the Kurdish minority and has still not apologised for the genocide of the Armenian people. In spite of all this, Turkey is regarded as a potential member of the European Union. Belarus is a country where the persecution of minorities is not as widespread as in Turkey. Belarus does not pursue any kind of hostile policy towards other nations and it wishes to open up its foreign policy and cooperate with other countries. Even so, Belarus is condemned, whilst Turkey is regarded as a country that could belong to the European Union. At the very least, we should apply similar standards to both countries.

We all know what happened. The events have been described to us by the Council, the Commission and individual Members of this House. We need to be honest with ourselves, however, and admit that this is also a failure for the European Union’s policy on Belarus so far. Furthermore, it is an unusually vivid example of what could happen to Ukraine if we do not carry out far-reaching reforms of our neighbourhood policy towards the latter. The history of Belarus since 1996 is an extremely alarming example of what could happen in this region, above all in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">What action can now be taken? Above all, major changes are needed. Firstly, we should not recognise the results of either the elections or the referendum. Indeed, none of the EU Member States should do so. Secondly, we must extend the list of people whom we do not wish to see in EU Member States to include members of the Belarussian authorities. Thirdly, this issue must be raised at summits held between the European Union and Russia. Russia has recognised the results of the elections, and exercises political patronage over this political experiment in the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital to invest in society, and we must make major investments in civil society. In order to do so, I believe a separate fund to support freedom and democracy is needed. We must have the courage and sufficient funding to set up an independent radio station broadcasting to Belarussians. The Belarussian intelligentsia is currently stifled in its own country. We must have sufficient funding to enable these individuals to study throughout Europe and to build a future for their country whenever such an opportunity arises, and whenever Belarus regains its independence. This will be an investment in our common European future, a future in which I believe deeply. If we do not make this investment, the United States will. In so doing, it will gain the good will of yet another country of Central and Eastern Europe. Personally, I would be very glad to see this happen, but I know many European politicians would not welcome such a development. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The turn-out was huge, and the constitutional change was approved by 77% of the electorate. We should be very pleased about this awakening of democratic awareness and about the broad popular turn-out. A number of people, such as the Vice-President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, believe themselves, however, authorised to take Belarus to task. Some of the accusations voiced have been hypocritical and demagogic, especially those made by governments that, before lecturing others, should put their own houses in order. Will the German people be consulted about the European Constitution? No. Mr Chirac will reach a decision on behalf of France concerning Turkey’s accession to Europe and do so against the obvious will of the French people. These accusations are, moreover, ill-considered. Rather than demonise a nation that has only been independent for 12 years, we should be very pleased about the progress it has accomplished on the road to democracy and not interfere in such an arrogant and moralistic way in its internal affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If Mr Maštálka and Mr Lang cannot see this, it is because they do not wish to do so. I was a member of the observation mission sent to monitor the elections, and I saw for myself the way in which they were conducted. The electoral procedure did not ensure that the election or referendum were democratic, and what is more, electoral practices frequently did not comply with this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We should draw two very important conclusions from this. Firstly, the Belarussian Parliament has no democratic mandate to represent the Belarussian people. Secondly, and this is something frequently overlooked, President Lukashenko has no democratic mandate to run for president in 2006, that is, to run for a third term of office and maybe even for subsequent ones. The first conclusion is contained in the resolution I hope this House will adopt with an overwhelming majority of votes. The second can be found in the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">What action should be taken? It has already been said that our policy on Belarus must be reconsidered. One extremely important principle was referred to in both the Presidency and the Commission statements, namely the principle of support for society. Our European policy on Belarus should be guided by the principle of supporting society and isolating the authorities, and this principle should remain in place until the authorities become democratic. Alternative sources of information for the Belarussian people must be created. A radio station broadcasting from Poland or Latvia should be established first, followed by a television channel. Secondly, an extensive programme of scholarships should be set up for Belarussian young people and students who wish to study in one of the EU Member States, as well as a programme to support universities willing to accept them. Finally, it is extremely important for there to be a unilateral abolition by EU Member States of visas and visa fees for Belarussians, a point which has not yet been raised in this House. This would be a very significant gesture, demonstrating that the European Union is open to the Belarussian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ten days ago in Belarus steps were taken which have distanced the country even more from democratic Europe. And Belarus has already been a neighbour of the EU for half a year. It is one thing for us to be more or less tolerant of a regime turning into an autocracy because it is far away, it is something altogether different, when a state, whose borders are barely thirty kilometres from Vilnius, one of the capitals of the EU States, is becoming unpredictable. Ties with Russia, where anti-European moods are spreading, and where some of the gains of democracy are being removed, are becoming stronger and this has a certain influence on Minsk. While supporting the position of the Council, I also believe that in the time left before the 2006 presidential elections it is necessary to adjust in principle EU policy on Belarus, to adapt it to new conditions. It is doubtful whether measures, which partially support the efforts of Belarus' rulers to isolate themselves, the country and its inhabitants, are effective. Generally speaking in the age of television, computers and information, self-isolation can only be successful over a historically short period of time. We must draw Belorussians into true cooperation with the European Union, offer the hope of being a fully entitled democratic part of Europe. Lithuania and Belarus' other neighbours have specific plans. These include the broadcasting of a free radio programme, the publishing of an opposition newspaper and the foundation of a European University of the Humanities in exile. Additional EU funding is needed in order to implement these ideas. Note that after 17 October, not double, but ten times more resources are needed for the creation of a civil society in Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

NATO delegates also suddenly discovered a link between Belarus and international terrorism. The European Union followed a similar tack.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement by the Dutch Presidency and the Commission on the results of the elections are, in our opinion, yet more pressure on and coercion of the government of Belarus. They violate international law and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of another state. The allegations both on the part of the European Union and on the part of the United States of America about alleged violations of democratic rights are hypocritical. The real reason, as we all know, for such intense intervention is the refusal by Belarus to yield to ΝΑΤΟ and the other imperialist organisations. The reports by the various western observers cannot be reliable, because they serve political expediencies, or should I say they are to order. Moreover, there are other reports, by Russia, China and the Commonwealth of Independent States, which are different.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the people of Belarus alone have the authority and responsibility to decide on their future, which is why we denounce and condemn such pressure and interference. No one gives you the right, gentlemen of the Commission, gentlemen of the Council, to teach and export democracy to other countries. The people alone have the authority to resolve their problems. Obviously, of course, both the European Union and the United States of America would express their satisfaction if the elections had been held as in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Kosovo or in Bosnia, which are under occupation, which have been turned into protectorates and in which, of course, in your opinion ...</p>

Yet we have maybe paid too little attention to Belarus and the East, given that Mr Lukashenko and the Belarussian authorities pay no heed to the European Union’s position. The reason for this may be that our demands for the protection of human rights and democracy in Belarus have to date been voiced in a mere whisper. It is not a whisper that is needed, however. We need to make ourselves heard in a loud and firm voice, maybe even shout sometimes. That is what is required to protect national minorities in Belarus, including the large Polish minority, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, we are not talking about a distant African or Asian country where a local tyrant is violating democracy. We are talking about the European Union’s closest neighbour, which is situated closer to Strasbourg or Brussels than some regions in a number of EU Member States. Are freedom of the media and freedom of elections, things that are the daily bread of Europeans, to be foreign words in Belarus? The short answer to this is ‘no’. We need to do more than merely discuss this issue. It is time to take action. We should boycott Mr Lukashenko, but we should not boycott the Belarussian people, organisations and youth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In addition, it has been said that Belarus can forget about the neighbourhood policy; instead, sanctions are in the offing, as the EU has a history of being willing to respond with sanctions to violations against democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">A week later, the opposite view was announced by the Russian Parliament, which declared that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were fair, free, democratic and legitimate. Only eight members of the Russian Duma voted against, while 416 were in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Our conclusion should be clear: the Russian Parliament has distanced itself from all democratic parliaments in the world and has also proved that the last dictator in Europe has the full backing of the Russian Duma, controlled by political forces closely linked to President Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost at the same time, another document – the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 – was signed by the American President. This is a clear commitment to support those in Belarus who are working towards democracy: students, trade unionists, civic and religious leaders, journalists and all citizens of Belarus claiming freedom for their nation. This document provides for USD 45 million to be used to strengthen democracy in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">What then should and could the European Union – and we, the European Parliament in particular – do? A month ago here in Strasbourg I spoke about the radio for good neighbourhood project for international broadcasting to Belarus. This aims to renew cross-border broadcasting to Belarus in one radio channel, using the data resources of Radyjo Ratsyya from Belarus and the high-powered broadcasting licence of Radio Baltic Waves from Vilnius, Lithuania. The support of Commissioner Verheugen and my colleagues from this Parliament is necessary to implement this idea.</p>

<p class="contents">I will reply on one issue, which was mentioned by Mr Wiersma, Mr Szymański, Mrs Andrikienė and others: namely Russia and the role that we and Russia could play. We regularly discuss with Russia the situation in Belarus. It is an important country for Russia and for the EU. Unfortunately, the Russian and EU approaches to improving the situation in Belarus differ. Russia understands EU concern about the human rights situation in general and about more specific issues such as the situation of the media and the closure of the European Humanities University. However, the Russians think that democratic change can best be promoted by involving Belarus more in the international community. As I tried to explain before, our approaches are really different, but you can be sure that where possible we are working with Russia on this important issue and trying to do what we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
