<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the serious background to the proposed directive on waste from extractive industries. It is still only a couple of years since we saw huge accidents involving collapsing tailings dams in Spain and Romania. In the case of Romania, the accident meant that important river systems were poisoned with cyanide. These accidents show the huge environmental risks that arise from mining waste not being handled correctly, as well as the subsequent international consequences. In addition to these major accidents, there has also been a series of minor ones and a kind of continuous poisoning of the environment from improperly handled waste from many years ago, dotted about the countryside and causing, for example, heavy metals to leak out into the water systems.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the European Union has no effective rules for dealing with these environmental problems. The regulations governing waste have not been adapted to cover this type of waste. With the proposed directive, something can be done about this. The cyanide method that was used in Romania would be banned under the proposed directive. We would make tough demands on the safety and supporting capacity of tailings dams. We would require mining companies to be serious in their approach, to return the countryside to the way it was and to be able, in economic terms too, to guarantee that the countryside is restored to its former state following mining.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading have been included by the Council of Ministers in the common position, and that is of course excellent. Other important proposals have, however, been rejected. It is therefore important for us to adopt those amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety whereby we are now trying to put back what was adopted at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to give a few examples of such changes. We do not just want an inventory to be drawn up of old mining waste. We also want something to be done about the situation, and this, in Parliament’s proposal, involves obligations. We also believe that the environmental problems that arise in excavation voids following extraction of minerals should be covered by the directive. In the Council’s common position, large groups of waste are exempted from essential parts of the directive, for example the financial guarantee. If this is to be prevented, we must adopt Amendment 13. It is important to remember that waste that is not dangerous in the chemical sense can also cause very serious environmental problems. That also applies to inert waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose that there should be greater stringency where exemptions are concerned. It should not be possible to grant long-term exemptions whereby waste can be put to one side. Instead, proper waste-processing facilities should be built. Such long-term exemptions now form part of the Council’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some examples of amendments through which we in Parliament want to see a significantly more far-reaching, effective and progressive directive than is the case with the Council’s common position. Voting against these amendments would be tantamount to lowering our environmental ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">A stringent and constructive directive in this area will not only be of benefit to the environment but will also favour the best, most modern and most environmentally aware mining companies that are also most serious in their approach. It will bring about speedier improvement in the industry. Commendably, it will also penalise those which do not accept their environmental responsibility. It will favour environmental technology and research. It may also make the EU a world leader in the area of environmental technology where mining is concerned, which would be another positive factor and might mean our being able to help other regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">With the proposals put forward in my report by Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have an opportunity to prevent serious accidents, similar to those in Spain and Romania, from happening in the future. We can ensure that we do not have to see more such accidents. We have the opportunity to reduce the amount of poisons released into our water systems. We also have the opportunity consistently to do something about damage wrought upon the environment in the past and to obtain better water status. Let us take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I wish to thank my fellow MEPs for their constructive cooperation. A number of fellow MEPs from a variety of political groups have put forward amendments that have improved this report. I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and I want to thank the Commission for its very constructive cooperation so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the consequences of the serious accidents caused by mining waste in Aznalcollar in Spain in 1998 and in Baia Mare in Romania in 2000 still fresh, the aim of the proposal for a Commission directive was to introduce rules at European Union level in a bid to minimise the repercussions which storing waste in tailings dams or heaps has on the environment and on human health, both under normal operating conditions and in the event of an accident.</p>
<p class="contents">In conjunction with the revised Sevezo II Directive on the control of major industrial accidents and a document on best available practices, the proposed directive will safeguard the proper management of waste from extractive industries throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the Commission accepted in full, in part or in principle 46 of the 74 amendments tabled by the European Parliament, in that they clarified and improved the text, while remaining consistent with the format and approach of the original Commission proposal. Forty-one amendments have now been incorporated into the common position either verbatim or materially.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council discussed the proposal during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies; it soon became apparent that a significant majority of the Member States considered that the scope of the Commission proposal was excessively ambitious and implied spending which they felt was out of proportion with the probable risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that many of the changes adopted in the common position improve its initial proposal. Most importantly, the provisions relating to inert waste have been extended, licensing procedures have been detailed, references to Community standards have been increased, especially to the standards adopted in the framework directive on water, demands for the long-term stability of waste facilities have been reinforced, stricter limit values have been set for cyanide compounds and an inventory of closed, abandoned sites has now been demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Council, which is interested in the principle of proportionality, has granted the Member States the facility to exempt non-hazardous, non-inert waste from certain provisions of the directive, especially from the need for a financial guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would prefer the wording of its initial proposal, which did not allow such exemptions. However, the Commission has decided to support the common position, taking account of the fact:</p>
<p class="contents">first, that no general exemption from the basic provisions of the directive is allowed and the competent authorities in the Member States will decide on a case-by-case basis and,</p>
<p class="contents">secondly, that no exemption is allowed from the main environmental safeguarding clauses in the directive relating to the safe design, operation, closure and after-closure of waste facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to point out that the Commission is willing to examine in a positive spirit any other possibility for compromise which may arise. I trust that we shall complete the procedure for this proposal as quickly as possible. We need the new directive, which will safeguard the environmentally correct management of mining waste both during the day-to-day operation of waste facilities and in the event of a major accident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improvements include the definition of waste, which has been made clearer, and a more precise description of the financial securities and the inventory of closed sites, along with the rules applicable to them. I can also go along wholeheartedly with what Mr Sjöstedt has just said; good work has been done, with a good cooperative approach, but there is one point, and a crucial one, on which we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats take a different view, and that is where the differential weighting of waste is concerned. We have to take account of the fact that mining waste has a different potential risk, and, as the Common Position does just that, it is right that the Member States should be able to distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous waste and reduce – or annul – the conditions placed upon non-hazardous, non-inert waste other than that very precisely defined as hazardous and included in Category A. There is a wide spectrum of mining waste, extending from such harmless materials as playsand, salt and topsoil at one end to the toxic cyanide derived from ore mining at the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot apply one single measure to everything. Particularly where non-hazardous, non-inert waste is involved, the imposition of excessive burdens on small and medium-sized businesses in the quarrying and earth-moving sector is indefensible. As you, Commissioner, pointed out, a quarry, or a sand or gravel pit cannot be regarded in the same light as a landfill for hazardous waste; all they are doing is meeting the demand for building materials.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask that the amendment to Article 3 be adopted. It is intended to extend the scope of this directive to the burning of chalk. People are willing to buy and use the waste products resulting from this, of which chalk dust is one; they are not hazardous and the Landfill Directive is not meant to apply to them. This would avoid unnecessary costs associated with landfill. In all that we do, we must not lose sight of our objective, which is to keep people and the environment safe with the minimum of red tape and expense. This is intended to achieve that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is a piece of legislation that does not exactly evoke much interest on the part of most of the European public – at any rate, not from those who live in my own country – but that has done nothing to save us from energetic lobbying on the part of interested parties – on the one hand, the unions, the industry and its associations and, on the other, the various environmental and consumer groups. Our drafting of a resolution has been made no easier by the fact that none of them want the same thing all the time – sometimes, indeed, the precise opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, I do believe that the Environmental Committee has presented the plenary with a balanced piece of legislation on which to vote, particularly as this Directive is supplementary in character. The Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive largely exclude the extractive industries, the types of waste produced by which do not in fact fit the regulations exactly, in that many of them present no problems in terms of the environment. Legal certainty, though, is a necessity – not only for people and their environment, but also for trading enterprises and for businesses engaged in the extraction of such raw materials as oil, coal, metals, clay, gravel or sand.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament always bear in mind: first, the protection of people and the environment, with a sustainable way of doing business, and secondly our enterprises’ need for a proper framework and conditions if they are to be able to do business and create jobs for the people whom we – as I said in my first point – want to protect from harm. Our rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, has been perceptive and rigorous in taking both these principles into account in this proposal for a resolution, and for that, many thanks to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly the case that an impressive number of Parliament's amendments have already been adopted and I think congratulations are due to the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that the Council has introduced a number of loopholes. I rather prefer the Commission's more ambitious proposals. Well, let us see how the votes go. But even if some of the more controversial amendments before us are accepted, I think that the Council and industry should understand that Parliament's representation on the Conciliation Committee will be positive and pragmatic. It is not in any of our interests to require steps to be taken that would hinder the efficient and economic operation of this industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We must accommodate some of the concerns expressed, for example the need for a proper transitional period to ensure that problems with mines closing prematurely in order to avoid the obligations of this directive are circumvented. But the Council should understand that Parliament must insist that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the natural environment is properly protected from commercial interests otherwise tempted to think only of short-term gain. As the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out, the sins that have been committed in the past need to be avoided in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that at a time when political Europe is searching for its identity, Europeans are, for their part, demanding that health protection and the preservation of the environment remain a priority for the European Union. This draft directive is directed to this end and it will also provide legal clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is justified by the amount of waste created by mineral extractions, which we know produce each year nearly a third of the waste generated in the Union, some of which is toxic, indeed very toxic. As it is inadequately treated and stored, it can seriously threaten the environment and people’s safety. We all recall the consequences of the Baia Mare and Baia Borsa disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive must also ensure that the new accession countries have the means to eradicate pollution from waste produced by extractions in the past. Furthermore, the industrialists concerned own operations throughout the world, and in order to prevent further disasters, the European Union must set an example by implementing operating rules guaranteeing the safety of workers and better protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I would like to offer three examples: the first concerns the operation of the uranium mines in Niger by European businesses. I have some knowledge of this – they are French businesses. The issue of contaminated waste has been raised time and again, during the Irish Presidency, for example, but even now questions remain unanswered. The second example concerns the very controversial project of the opening of a gold mine at Rosia Montana, in Romania, a project that provides for the construction of a tailings pond for waste of highly toxic extraction, with a dam – brace yourselves – measuring 30 metres high. Finally, the last example calls to mind the destruction of the coral reef in New Caledonia, for which we were responsible, by extractive waste from the nickel mines. This last example, Commissioner, illustrates the need to prohibit direct discharges into continental, coastal or marine waters, unless, of course, they are compatible with the Water and Waste directives.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we support the work carried out by our rapporteur and we hope that you will support these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, although mining is less widespread in Ireland now than it once was, some mining companies have left a legacy that continues to pollute our land and water due to a lack of proper checks. A case in point is the situation in Tynagh Mines in Co. Galway in the West of Ireland, which, since its closure in 1981, has continued to be an environmental hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the European Union, hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated by mining and many sites left in a condition which poses grave dangers. It is important, therefore, to deal not only with waste generated following such a directive but also to deal with historical waste arising from facilities that have been abandoned or which were not shut down properly. We should also reverse the Council's lifelong exemption from some of the key provisions for certain existing facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's proposals, as one of my colleagues has already said, are balanced; they should be welcomed by responsible companies within the mining industry, as well as by people whose lives and livelihoods have been damaged by irresponsible mining operations. I commend this excellent report by Mr Sjöstedt and thank him for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Ireland, as in many other places, we cannot begin to deal with the problem of deteriorating human health or clean up our environment without tackling the problem of old mines and the waste that was left behind when the mines were closed and the mining companies dissolved.</p>
<p class="contents">In Silvermines, County Tipperary, a 147-acre, 40-foot high plateau of fine red toxic tailing pond blights the area and in dry weather the dust blows across several counties. Mud lagoons dissolve the mercury, arsenic, cadmium, antimony and many other toxic minerals, and channel them via neighbouring streams straight into the Shannon River, only metres away from where the water supply for Limerick City is taken. Animals and, most importantly, people in the area suffer from an incredible range – a tragic range – of diseases, the kind that demonstrate an environmental attack on the immune system. That is a sin from the past; the company concerned has gone and the mess needs to be cleaned up.</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem is that one of the biggest industries in the west of Ireland is a company that ships mining waste into Ireland. It is on an island and has its own docks. It brings in bauxite to make alumina. It claims that it is safe and it creates big red mud tailings ponds. That industry wants to expand this year, next year and the year after. The rate of animal death in the area was so alarming that it sparked an investigation a number of years ago, which documented unprecedented animal deaths. It was not uncommon for farmers – and these are not large farms – to have lost 150 animals per farm in the area around the industry. Also very startling was the amount of human death from cancer and the amount of learning disability among children. We need very strong …</p>

<p class="contents">Although not all extractive industries have the same environmental and safety impact, if the Committee on the Environment succeeds, then this legislation will make them all needlessly subject to the same restraint. Legislation to fit the need is one thing, legislation not tailored to need is invariably oppressive and destructive of competitiveness. So it is here, with the rapporteur trying to require all sites – regardless of size, product and complexity – to comply with all articles.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sound reason why the shallow sand quarry should be subjected to the same legislative demands as the large, deep mine producing hazardous waste. The requirements for non-hazardous or inert waste should remain proportional and not, as proposed by the committee, be largely subjected to the same stringency as Category A hazardous-waste sites. The framework directive on waste and the landfill directive make adequate provision for non-hazardous waste quarries. There is no convincing or compelling reason for these further burdens to be placed on this important sector of our economic production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We desperately need this directive, which covers mining waste containing cyanide and heavy metals, and other waste that presents a risk to the environment, for example due to its physical volume.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recall the disaster, dubbed simply by some the ‘cyanide-tsunami’, that took place in the Romanian town of Baia Mare (Nagybánya) in 2000, or the contamination incident in Spain in 1998. In both of these cases, large volumes of dangerous substances spilled into rivers, causing enormous damage to the natural environment, even in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation now before us has some very good qualities. It tightens licensing procedures and places greater emphasis on prevention; it makes it compulsory for operators to draw up a detailed waste management plan and makes information on mining waste more accessible; its extends the areas to which financial guarantees relating to such operations will apply, and obliges mining companies to ensure complete rehabilitation and monitoring of areas where they have ceased operations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, however, the most important and most forward-looking aspect – in view of the impending accession of Romania and Bulgaria, and the large-scale mining projects currently in preparation or under way that present a risk to the environment and to neighbouring countries – is that the new directive must also be taken into account by newly acceding Member States from the date it enters into force. For this very reason, I call upon my fellow Members to vote in favour of these rigorous amendments aimed at achieving environmental protecting objectives, and in doing so to take a major step towards safeguarding our environment and preventing disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before this incident, the term ‘environmental policy’ had been nothing more than a strange phrase for many ordinary people living on the two banks of the river – for peasants, shepherds and fishermen. After 30 January 2000, they understood the meaning of ‘environmental policy’: to prevent pollution of this kind, in which 100 000 m3 of hazardous sludge leaked into the River Tisza, destroying its flora and fauna.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not like to speak in terms of money when we are talking about the value of nature, but the Centre for Environmental Studies estimated that the loss of revenue suffered by commercial fishing and tourism was around EUR 18 million in Hungary alone, not including the loss of natural heritage or environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome this report. Mr Sjöstedt did an excellent job: as well as writing a good report, he went to Baia Mare, Romania, where he visited the site of the pollution. He met the people living, working and suffering there, and his local experiences are integrated into the report.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation should be strict and well integrated into other Community policies. I have tabled three amendments which were supported by the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I hope they will also be supported by this plenary session. My aims were to clarify the requirements of the directive by giving references to the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive, to prevent the discharge of environmentally harmful mining waste into any body of water and, last but not least, to promote waste prevention as the primary means of waste management.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to a specific problem that is highly important for a number of countries. This is the issue of mines that have already been closed down and have therefore stopped taking mining waste, while rehabilitation work is being carried out in line with valid European permits. Because of the length of time needed to close mines down, this rehabilitation will still be in progress when this directive enters into force. In order to avoid the duplication of procedures and an increase in the costs of rehabilitation as a result of the possible requirement for new permits, it would be sensible to make special provisions regarding these cases for a transitionary period under conditions of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">This was done in the third paragraph of Article 24 of the joint position of the Council. The aim of the directive, that from the moment of its entry into force no further damage should occur in the process of closing down mines, would not be in jeopardy if in mines where the rehabilitation process is almost complete, that process could be completed without hindrance.

The aspects of the directive relating to environmental protection require further work, however. In places the directive is also irrational, and it will create more red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically, the extractive industry in Poland has been a mainstay of the national economy, and this continues to be the case today. It was for this reason that, during pre-accession negotiations, Poland pressed for the relaxation of certain provisions making it mandatory for operators of waste treatment facilities to provide financial guarantees. Even highly hazardous industrial sectors do not comply with such requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">After the draft directive had been submitted to Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted amendments that ran counter to earlier decisions made regarding the draft. These amendments are extremely disadvantageous to the Polish extractive industry, since the additional burdens they entail will result in it becoming uncompetitive, as well as posing a risk of bankruptcy for the brown coal industry. This would present a threat to energy security in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive transfers too broad a range of responsibilities to industrial entities. Furthermore, it places hazardous waste on the same footing as inert waste. The end result of all this will be a sharp increase in operating cost, and the need to allocate huge sums of money from state budgets to cover the costs of drawing up inventories of facilities and adaptations to the latter. It is for this reason that some indication of funding sources is urgently needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is especially true in areas of high mining activity, where it is not uncommon for various raw materials to have been mined for several hundred years. In many cases the raw materials in question were exploited wastefully, with both deposits and the environment being destroyed, and little regard being paid to the management of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive under debate, and above all the numerous amendments that have been tabled, fail to do justice to the current state of affairs. They deal with the issue in an arbitrary fashion, and take no account of the situation in regions where deposits are mined most intensively. The proposed inventories of existing waste and waste generated during routine operations will only serve to identify waste management requirements and the related technical possibilities. In view of the limits placed on the EU budget, it is unrealistic to expect large amounts of EU funding to be earmarked for implementation of the directive. By and large, it will be regional and national budgets that bear the burden of implementing the directive by rectifying the shortcomings that have already been identified. The current owners of facilities will also incur greater costs through no fault of their own, and more money will need to be spent on guarantees and suchlike. This will mean bankruptcy for facilities that are suffering financial problems, and their waste will then be left unmanaged.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose that certain amendments should not be incorporated into the draft directive. These include amendments that point out the obvious, those that set unrealistic deadlines, those that give rise to unjustified increases in costs, of which there are several, and those that limit the opportunities available to Member States to adapt the given requirements to regional and national needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should establish proportionate and loophole-free rules to apply fairly and uniformly across the whole of European business and industry. We also have an acceptable compromise report before us. Our aim has been to prevent accidents and the consequent damage to the environment and human health that can result from the handling and disposal of waste materials from the mineral oil-extracting industries, and we have sought to do this by laying down minimum standards to improve the management of this sort of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste from the extractive industries amounts to some 400 million tonnes per annum, equivalent to 29% of the waste produced by the Community as a whole. Managing it does of course involve risks; we are all familiar with the accidents in such places as Baia Mare and Aberfan, among others.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that ecologically-responsible rules for waste management not only reduce the quantity of waste, but also give businesses an incentive to invest in research into environmental issues associated with the extractive industries and thereby acquire from the world market know-how that they can analyse. There are many examples of this: let me give you one from Austria, where one firm has managed to avoid depositing some 100 000 tonnes of minerals used in construction in landfill sites. Despite that, there are weak points, one example being the lack of clarity as to the directive’s scope. I find it regrettable that a majority could not be found to support the amendment I tabled on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out the need for provisions to be enacted to deal with non-hazardous or inert waste, and that these must be proportionate. I therefore believe that Amendments 11, 13 and 47 should be rejected and that we should come up with alternative proposals for provisions relating to non-hazardous and inert waste, with separate consideration for these concepts. The use of landfill sites for non-hazardous or inert waste should also be allowed for a limited period of time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">James Nicholson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening. I am extremely concerned about this issue, because once again Europe is trying to bring in and implement a draft regulation that tries to make one suit fit all. I do not think this can work and that is where I have a problem. We should not be so dictatorial with our directives.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone has already pointed out in this debate, not all quarries that are extractive industries are the same. I have no doubt that some of the very large industries will be able to cope with this and take it in their stride, but the small entrepreneurs trying to develop small industries and get them off the ground are probably going to be hit very hard. I have no objection when we are talking about hazardous waste, because that always has to be controlled. But it will be the smaller businesses where jobs will be lost; they are the ones that will go to the wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I believe we should bring in directives that are not implemented in the same way in each Member State. I have personal experience of this. I come from Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and across the border, in the Republic of Ireland, the waste oil directive is interpreted differently. In quarries six miles apart, one in Dundalk and the other in Newry, a European directive is being implemented differently in two Member States. Waste oil is considered hazardous in the United Kingdom, whereas in the Republic of Ireland it is not. This is forcing quarry owners to move from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland in order to compete, because otherwise they cannot.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways. I believe that will happen with this one as well, and quarry owners are not happy about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stavros Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Μember of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their very constructive observations and to give a number of answers relating to waste from processing bauxite, which was referred to earlier, in order to make alumina: this waste is covered by the directive, which will ensure that repercussions, especially on water, are minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Nicholson's last remark, which differs from what previous speakers said, about old abandoned waste facilities, the Commission and the Council agree in the common position that an inventory should be prepared. Nonetheless, it is better for restoration to be left to the Member States, given that the framework directive on water continues to apply in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as far as the facility to grant exemptions for non-inert waste is concerned, this does not concern the main environmental demands, which continue to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the new directive, which will safeguard environmentally proper management of mining waste both during the day-to-day operation of waste facilities and in the event of a major accident. I trust that we shall complete the procedure for this proposal as quickly as possible, so that we can safeguard better protection of human health and the environment, as Mr Davies also said, in a way which really will be pragmatic and will respond to the demands of the various interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the amendments: the amendments relating to the scope of the directive are particularly important. Amendments 2 and 13 delete the permissible exemptions for non-hazardous, non-inert waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to accept them for the reasons I explained in my first intervention. For the same reasons, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment 11 increasing the breadth of the provisions which apply to inert waste, or Amendment 15 deleting the various permissible time periods before a waste storage area qualifies as a 'waste facility'.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position has already been worded to reflect the relevant amendments which emerged at first reading and safeguards the necessary proportionality. As a result, Amendment 47 amending the criteria for classifying facilities under category Α cannot be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financial guarantees, Amendment 37 requiring the Commission to approve the relevant national procedures is unacceptable, because it adds bureaucratic formalities without any added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 7, 38 and 39 are also unacceptable, because the initial text contains a practical method for calculating the amount of money required.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments refer specifically to the protection of water. The Commission considers that this issue is already adequately covered by the relevant provisions of the directive supplementing the general provisions of the framework directive on water and by other Community legislation on water which already applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am able to support Amendments 29, 30, 32 and 33 clarifying the obligations which apply and referring directly to Community legislation on water.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we are unable to agree with Amendment 36 bringing ordinary voids under Community regulations in order to prevent water pollution. I understand Parliament's concern, but I believe that this issue is adequately covered by the framework directive on water.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, Amendment 42 introduces obligations which will need to be applied during the transitional period granted to existing waste facilities, especially the obligation to comply with the framework directive on water. I believe, for the reasons I explained earlier, that this is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Another source of concern to Parliament was the important legacy from the past in the form of closed and abandoned waste facilities causing pollution. Even though the need for an inventory of these closed sites has now been included in the common position, I have the impression – as I said earlier – that the additional demands imposed by Amendment 40 and the related Amendment 41 can be covered more effectively at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the remaining amendments proposed by Parliament are acceptable: Amendment 10 may help to promote the integration of the environment into other policies. Amendments 17, 18 and 21 explain the content of waste management plans in greater detail. Amendment 27 expressly refers to protected areas. The Commission supports these amendments, which pursue the same objectives as its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I am happy to announce that the Commission can accept eight amendments in full and a further six amendments in principle or in part. I shall file a complete list of the Commission's positions on the amendments with the Secretariat<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
