Personally, I would prefer to see a ban on cluster bombs, but the cluster munitions coalition, which comprises a reasonably large group of NGOs and probably has a realistic idea of the state of play with regard to negotiations about a protocol at international level, has argued in favour of a temporary moratorium because that appears to be the most likely course of action. In the final analysis, as we have seen over the past few days, that is what politics is about, namely the threat to create a real power base by means of a majority. Needless to say, if this is to succeed –and here we can count on the broad support of this Parliament – it does require commitment on the part of the Council, the Commission and the Member States. We need a new protocol that addresses all the humanitarian problems associated with cluster munitions, such as have once again been raised quite specifically during a hearing of the Committee on Development. We have seen how a good deal of those munitions end up in precisely the world’s poorest countries, from Afghanistan to the Falkland Islands, and also closer to home, in Serbia and Montenegro. To this day, 78 countries have some 400 million anti-personnel mines and anti-vehicle mines in stock, which demonstrates that a vast quantity is still available even in our Fifteen Member States; indeed, they are still being manufactured in ten of them. It is obvious that international agreements are the only means left of tackling this. We need a protocol, so tough and intensive negotiations are required, and this is where Europe can speak with one voice. Speaking with one voice is something of which we are very much in favour. The Red Cross and the UN are on our side. Actually, this is where I would like to ask the Members belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to take a step closer to us. I cannot imagine that we do not have any common ground here; we may well not have any where Mr Buttiglione is concerned, but on cluster bombs we should be able to see eye to eye. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When launched, a bomb of this kind can disintegrate into anything up to 8 000 bomblets, which then lie spread across areas of up to 240 000 square metres – about 50 football pitches – and work in much the same way as land mines, threatening civilians, children and women just as much as military personnel. This is clearly in breach of Article 51 of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, 18 months ago, on 10 February 2003, the European Parliament called for a moratorium on the manufacture and use of such cluster munitions and cluster bombs, and for them to be banned outright in the long term. This makes it a political scandal that these weapons are still being produced in the European Union – in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. So what we are doing is adopting a pious resolution to the effect that this sort of thing is a violation of human rights and has to stop, and then we go on producing the things. At national level, our governments are doing nothing about this. That is hypocrisy, and that is why it is absolutely necessary that this House should again make its voice heard in opposition to the production of such weapons in the European Union and against the trade in them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perverse thinking for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to acknowledge, in item 1 of their resolution, the devastating effects of these weapons, and then, in item 3, to express understanding for the military use of them, on the grounds that the armed forces would otherwise deploy even worse weaponry. I think the ethical stance of the Christian members of the conservative group must make such a position untenable, so I call upon them to withdraw this item from their resolution; it really does undermine the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cause is essential, I believe, in promoting a culture that can help to prevent and resolve the problems that man brings upon himself in an endless succession of suffering, injuries and deaths, which all too often affect the civilian population and which are caused by the laying of landmines in many countries. Mines are deadly weapons of war that we must oppose at all costs, since they are directed against the civilian population, remain active indefinitely and often make it impossible to implement effective mine-clearing operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the international community has taken action on these issues. Non-governmental organisations have mounted a major campaign, backed by a collection of signatures, and have launched a spontaneous movement which has led the governments of many countries to sign the Ottawa Treaty. This is a major international treaty which has banned anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we must move on from that treaty, we must encourage a swell of opinion and then, I hope, action by governments who can draw up further conventions, legal instruments and protocols with a view to banning other types of mine. I am referring to cluster munitions, extremely deadly mines whose devastating effect is many times greater than that of anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has had the chance to see the exhibits on display in some museum of horror, if I can use that turn of phrase, cannot help but feel indignation and a strong impulse to take action on this issue. We have recently been to Slovenia, and were able to see in a museum the effects of this kind of mine.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw photos, pictures of fields, pictures of wounded people. We met people who bear in their flesh the effects of these weapons, which the international community must ban. They are not traditional tools of war, precisely because they are not confined to the battlefields and will strike civilian populations, women and children. They strike the children who play in the fields, the women who go into the cultivated fields to gather their food, where instead they encounter death.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this Parliament will undertake to broaden the existing convention to include this other type of deadly weapon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A fervent appeal to the rules of international law is the way to find refuge from barbarity and the law of the jungle.</p>
<p class="contents">The appeal contained in the joint resolution, which we will vote on today, brings in this line of defence and calls for a moratorium as well as an undertaking to abolish the use, production, storage and exporting of cluster munitions. These munitions pose a danger to the civilian population. Women, children, the old, men, whom I have seen with lacerated flesh and amputated limbs – in Kabul, in Kandahar, in Pristina – in the clinics where they are trying to save what can be saved. This is barbarity, since these mines are used by our democratic countries.</p>
<p class="contents">US aircraft dropped thousands of cluster bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq. On the outskirts of Kabul I saw those yellow objects that attract children and are the same colour as food rations, which always used to arrive in the villages from the sky.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least 57 countries holding stocks of cluster munitions, 22 of which are in Europe. There is no doubt that this is in breach of international law. We have to ensure that the safeguarding of human rights prevails over military interests: the right to life for millions of people. This is a goal which we have to set ourselves. For the European Parliament this has to be a commitment, as was the case for the ratification of the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty, thanks to the unceasing work of thousands of people in non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we still have to convince Poland, Finland and Latvia to sign up to it. We must also negotiate a new protocol to the convention on conventional weapons and, at the conference to review the Ottawa Treaty, encourage a consensus among states to ban anti-tank mines with sensitive fuses, which explode on human contact. A resolution is not enough; we cannot stop there, and that is why we have also asked for permanent monitoring by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our armed forces have fully supported this work. Their judgment, which we share, is that cluster munitions and anti-tank mines should not be regarded in the same way as anti-personnel landmines. At this time, our armed forces need to retain the unique capabilities of these weapons in their armouries. Indeed, military authorities estimate that if cluster munitions were banned, disproportionately powerful munitions would be required to achieve the same effect. Such weapons might pose a greater risk to civilians during conflict and would increase the levels of devastation caused.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to the post-conflict effects of cluster munitions and anti-tank mines, much progress has been made in Geneva on dealing with the explosive remnants of war. Work continues to improve the technical aspects of certain weapons so that they do not continue to be a threat to local civilians after a conflict has ended. These initiatives are spearheaded by a group of governmental experts who are mindful of the need for the right balance between humanitarian concerns and military utility.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding certain weapons, it is well understood that the armed forces of our nations, and those of NATO allies, are the most conscious of the need to protect our civilian populations, avoid collateral damage and ensure that dangers to our own troops are minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion before this House, tabled by the Left, fails to take into account such considerations and is factually incorrect. Its provisions are unrealistic and, consequently, it would not be helpful in tackling the problems caused by explosive remnants of war.</p>
<p class="contents">On a positive note, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commission and the Member States on the support they have provided for global mine action against anti-personnel landmines, mine clearance and assistance to victims. I would encourage them to focus their efforts to end this threat to civilian populations from the explosive remnants of war and anti-personnel landmines by 2010 at the latest, and not be sidetracked by other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge Members to support the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have in fact decided that our members will have a free vote, and I am very definitely among those who intend to support this resolution when it comes to be voted on.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought it interesting that Mr van den Berg should mention the name of Buttiglione. Mr Buttiglione and I were among those Christian Democrats who were forthrightly critical of the Iraq war, and of the use of cluster munitions in it, from the very outset, and so I find it regrettable that Mr Buttiglione’s presence in the Commission has been thought undesirable. He would be a very good ally to have on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that Mr Schmidt appealed to our Christian convictions. This he has said – and let me say this loud and clear – at the end of a week when we in this House have been told time and time again that policy must not be influenced by religious convictions. I disagree with that, and my Christian convictions lead me to believe that everything possible must indeed be done to deal not only with anti-personnel mines of every kind, but also with cluster munitions, which really do present an extreme danger to the civilian population, and particularly to children. Let us not, however, apply double standards. People’s Christian convictions can lead them to adopt quite divergent political positions, but they should in any case respect each other’s. I personally take the view – as I believe does the majority in my group – that we should implement this moratorium, which makes sense and is necessary, and I can only say that we should very definitely make an issue of the use of cluster munitions in Chechnya, as Russia is a member state of the Council of Europe, which sits here in Strasbourg. Although Chechnya, if one regards it – as many do, although I do not – as part of Russia, can therefore be said to be Council of Europe territory and thus subject to the Convention on Human Rights, cluster munitions are deployed directly against the civilian population. The same, though, is true of Iraq, just as it was true of the Balkans. As we cannot be narrow-minded about this, let me say that I very much support this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore prefer to express my support for the text of the resolution – which takes up the majority of our suggestions – and express my full agreement with what my colleague, Mr van den Berg, has said, and I will not mention the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats asking us to vote one way or another, since I believe our positions identify who we are and I believe that, on issues such as this, it is very good that we can see exactly who everybody is so that public opinion and the organisations can differentiate between us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add two comments. Firstly, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, unlike antipersonnel mines, the manufacture of cluster bombs requires very complex technology, a technology which is only within reach of the highly industrialised countries, and that means the responsibilities of the Member States of the Union are under scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, a very sophisticated air or land infrastructure is essential in order to launch these bombs, as well as specific knowledge for the military personnel capable of firing them. And some of our countries clearly have a role here as well, both in terms of logistical preparation and in the training of military personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hearing we held – which was magnificent – I was disappointed that we found it rather difficult to name those countries of the world, whether European or not, who are producing the weapons we are condemning here. I would also have thought it relevant to name those countries and their corresponding responsibilities in our resolution. And that leads me to my second comment, which is to insist that the European Parliament must commit itself to sparing no effort to ensure that what we approve today does not remain mere words.</p>
<p class="contents">There are concrete proposals suggested to us by the organisations, who must continue to be our permanent interlocutor in this fight. For example, we are very interested in the idea of designating a rapporteur to monitor, on behalf of the European Parliament, what is being done in our countries and internationally with regard to eliminating cluster bombs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Germany, this war was supported by all the political groupings apart from the PDS, particularly by the Social Democrats and the Greens, and the consequences are still tangible. It is reported that between 30 000 and 50 000 stray cluster bombs are still to this day contaminating whole tracts of land in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to speak plainly here: most of the firms making profits from cluster bombs are European, the German firm of Rheinmetall being one example. It is evident that large-scale bombardments with cluster bombs are regarded as part of waging war. The Americans and the British used 13 000 such projectiles in their war on Iraq, and so the only right response is an outright ban on cluster bombs. If we are to have that, we must be outspoken in our criticism of the weapons industry and of the armed forces that use these weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that our resolution today helps to foster such awareness and to precipitate such action.</p>
<p class="contents">This text criticises the continuing and frequent deployment of cluster munitions in armed conflict. Not only does it claim victims while hostilities are in progress, but also for years afterwards, a problem underlined in Human Rights Watch’s report on the conduct of the Iraq war and its civilian victims, which was published at the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In it, we read that the use of large quantities of cluster munitions, particularly by American and British ground troops, claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians. I do not believe that much is to be gained by affirmations of a desire to make such weaponry safer and to produce it in such a way that its effects on the civilian population are less devastating. It follows that this House’s call for an immediate moratorium on the production and use of cluster bombs is extraordinarily important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also concerned about the particular difficulties involved in clearing areas contaminated by this specific type of active munitions. As you are aware, the European Union has always been an ardent supporter of the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War to the United Nations Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons. We now need all of the Member States to ratify this protocol so that it can enter into force as soon as possible, which, as you know, is not yet the case.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, we are doing our best to solve the problems posed by cluster munitions by working in two main areas. The first that I will mention is mine clearance operations. These operations, like our initiatives to raise awareness of the risks and help victims, are carried out by virtue of Community instruments, in particular the Parliament and the Council regulation on anti-personnel landmines, and in practice often involve the removal of other unexploded ordnance. This is what we are doing in Laos, Cambodia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, to mention just a few countries. These efforts are clearly far from adequate. Although this debate gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Parliament for its unstinting support for the regulation on anti-personnel landmines, I must nevertheless remind you that the budget for mine clearance and hiring experts in this field is not enough to tackle the problems posed by all of the explosives that still need to be made safe, including cluster munitions and anti-vehicle mines. From the point of view of the Commission, the priority remains achieving the objectives set out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines, with its deadline of 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of our work has just been launched: it is to implement the pilot project on small arms and explosive remnants of war. Here too, I should like to thank Parliament for making it possible for the Commission to examine closely all of the issues and problems associated with both the explosive remnants of war and the dissemination of small arms. This pilot project should enable the Commission to propose measures that will give the Union a level of expertise, knowledge and authority in the field of small arms and the explosive remnants of war that is comparable with what it has acquired thanks to the regulation on anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the Commission’s reaction. We will collaborate with all of the stakeholders to guarantee that an integrated and comprehensive humanitarian approach is adopted to all of the problems posed by what we by convention call the remnants of war, but which it would perhaps be more appropriate to call the trash of war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
