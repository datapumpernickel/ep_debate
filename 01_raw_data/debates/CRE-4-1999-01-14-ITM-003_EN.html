There is now an institutional conflict between the Parliament and the Commission, and I believe that we will not be able to explain it to our electorate if we start arguing about various individual positions and split Parliament into subtly differentiated factions, instead of adopting an unequivocal position towards the fraud, corruption and nepotism inside the Commission. I think this House agrees that that is what this motion of censure is all about, and in that sense it is the most significant. That is what we have to vote on. We have requested a roll‐call vote in this case because if it eventually comes out that Parliament did not act firmly in this institutional conflict, it will have made a poor start, a false start if you like, to the election campaign. That is why I am requesting this vote.</p>

It will shortly take a position, in all sovereignty, on the question of confidence. This is an important moment in the life of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to say a few words about the resolution. As I said, the message to the Commission is a clear one, and I understood it fully. I am taking on board the criticisms that have been expressed and I commit myself here and now to completing, according to a strict timetable, the ambitious programme that I have proposed, and to fulfilling the demands made by this Parliament. I see this test as a means of giving a very strong impetus to the necessary reforms. Today the European Parliament has strongly reaffirmed its authority and its monitoring role. As democrats, we should all welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about this idea of a committee of experts. I accept it, as it will enable us to completely review our methods, to improve our management, and to cast a critical eye over the fight against fraud. Obviously, this committee could also examine certain individual cases, and I will state clearly that the recommendations from the committee of experts will be followed up with actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it goes without saying that the Commission will continue to be accountable to Parliament"s monitoring bodies. I said to you on Monday that each case of fraud pains me. Each time it is Europe that loses out. I admit that mistakes have been made. We have been criticised, but our good will has never been questioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I have now been involved in political life for thirty years. I have always thought of that as a privilege, but also as an obligation to absolute integrity. I respect taxpayers" money and, with the help of Parliament, I am more determined than ever to continue the fight against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is up to you, ladies and gentlemen, to decide, in good faith and in good conscience, whether you are going to grant us your confidence, the political confidence that we need to continue and to complete our political work in the interests of the citizens of Europe and to enable Europe to succeed. That is purely and simply what I ask you to grant us today.</p>

What we have been calling for since December, thanks to the excellent work of the Committee on Budgetary Control led by Mrs Theato and with Mr Elles as rapporteur, has now been accepted in the Commission"s eight‐point programme within a very strict deadline. Why should we not be happy with this? On the contrary. We have not been party to any political manoeuvring, and we have every reason to be happy because what was most important to us was the content.</p>

<p class="contents">This is an undeniable and extremely important result, and I hope that it will be reflected in the forthcoming negotiations on the revision of the Treaty.

I certainly do not regret it today, far from it.

This must change!</p>
<p class="contents">Our instrument of naming names was perforce indelicate since no proper Treaty‐based alternative yet exists to hold individual Commissioners publicly accountable before this Parliament for the political management and conduct of European affairs and subject them to sanctions where and when they fall short.</p>
<p class="contents">For months in this House the college of Commissioners has suffered from a self‐induced collapse in its credibility. In collusion with the Socialist Group, the Commission inexplicably last December drew this week's crisis upon itself.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Politically we believe that this Commission is dead in the water.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">When we demanded individual accountability, we were rebuffed by the shield of collegiality. We have decided, Mr President of the Commission, to turn your shield of collegiality into our sword of parliamentary accountability. For Europe, in good faith and in good conscience, the ELDR Group believes this Commission should go. My Group will vote for censure.</p>

Our group condemns the lack of cooperation and transparency that the Commission has demonstrated for too long towards both Parliament and the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for Europe Group has taken note of President Santer"s promise to put right the most glaring problems, but it deplores the fact that it took a vote of disapproval, the refusal of discharge, and the threat of an actual motion of censure, on which we are now going to vote, to bring about that result.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, some members of the group, notably the French members, noting that previous commitments that were made at the time of the BSE motion of censure, and also following the decisions of the Committee of Inquiry into Fraud in Community transit, were not entirely fulfilled, have decided to vote for the motion of censure ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">in order to remind the Commission that the European Parliament"s monitoring powers must be respected because they are the only real means of protecting the citizens, the European taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, other members of the group, notably our Irish, Italian and Portuguese colleagues, have decided to grant the Commission mitigating circumstances and not to vote for censure, so as not to give rise to an institutional crisis at a time when Europe is faced with enormous challenges. This leniency cannot, however, be interpreted by the Commission as a blank cheque of confidence.</p>

<p class="contents">We hope that from now on, these decisions by the European Parliament will increase the credibility of this institution and its links with the real lives of the public.

I must add that, as regards this joint statement by my group, there were differences of opinions and conflicting ideas, as has happened in other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the group believes that the Commission"s management deserves to be censured and it is therefore going to vote in favour of the motion of censure. However, certain Members are going to vote against, while others – a substantial number, including myself, although not the majority – believe that our political life and our institution have been constantly exploited by the motions of censure. We are therefore not going to take part in the vote.</p>

My group has always made it clear that our basic line was that the Commission should resign and that we cannot put our confidence in it, not just because of the financial scandals, but also because of its policies in so many fields: BSE, genetically modified foods on the market, and so on.</p>

You can have accountability without having blame. The Europe of Nations Group does not have an opinion about who is to blame. We leave that to disciplinary proceedings and the Court of Justice. We are voting to censure the college because the whole Commission is accountable and must accept responsibility for the fact that so much has gone wrong and will continue to go wrong. If the political leadership does not accept accountability, then there is no accountability. The budget would then become a matter of helping oneself. The main problem is that Mr Santer and his colleagues are not leading, but are allowing themselves to be led into a muddle of waste, fraud and corruption. Mr Santer is a prisoner in his own fortress. The Personnel Commissioner is a prisoner. The Director of Personnel is a prisoner. Only a motion of censure will release the prisoners and create a new culture of openness, closeness to the people and democracy, instead of secrecy, arrogance and bureaucracy. Mr Santer reacted firmly when he should not have done, but he was not firm when he should have been. He sacked an official for giving a document to an elected representative. Instead, he ought to sack the people who do not give the elected representatives what they ask for. That is why the Europe of Nations Group also wishes to sack Mr Santer's Commission today.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly a resolution was tabled that was aimed specifically at certain Commissioners, with the purpose of defusing the risk of a general vote of no confidence in the Commission. This first manoeuvre was thwarted. At the same time, the Socialist Group tabled a false motion of censure, intended to neutralise its opponents, which it then withdrew at the last moment. However, fortunately, this second manoeuvre was also thwarted, as the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations in the meantime tabled another motion of censure, this time a genuine one.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a draft resolution was tabled, aimed at putting an end to the debate by setting up a ‘committee of experts". That third manoeuvre appears to have succeeded, as the resolution has just been passed. However, in reality, it discredits Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact it is not a parliamentary committee of inquiry that has just been adopted, it is simply a committee of experts which, the resolution specifies, will be placed ‘under the auspices of the Parliament and the Commission". In other words, this committee will depend at least partly on the very institution whose management it will be responsible for monitoring. This blatant abandonment of Parliament"s powers displays clearly the complicity that has long existed between the European Parliament and the Commission in order to advance the federalist cause at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations considers that the Commission"s errors are sufficiently serious, evident and repeated to warrant a motion of censure. With this approach, we wish to call into question the very system of federalist complicity that has led to all the current problems. We welcome the fact that our motion has received the support of 232 Members of the European Parliament (against 293), which, taking account of the usual discrepancies between public opinion and Parliament, must demonstrate that an overwhelming majority of citizens support us.</p>

<p class="contents">In adopting the motion for a resolution by the PSE, ARE and GUE/NGL Groups with 319 votes in favour, 157 against and 54 abstentions, Parliament has demonstrated its authority and capacity for control, as noted by the Commission President. However, the Socialist Group"s motion for a resolution does not represent a blank cheque for the Commission. On the contrary, it requires ambitious reform of the Commission"s administrative and financial practices and a rigorous investigation of all the accusations of irregularities made in the last few weeks in order to find out whether or not there is anything to be censured. The reports containing the results of this investigation will be presented very shortly, by 15 March.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group has therefore wholeheartedly confirmed the strategy it outlined during the last part‐session in December, in accordance with its proposed objectives of maintaining institutional stability at a crucial time for the future of Europe and of blocking the partisan manoeuvres of the PPE involving insinuations targeted at individual Commissioners. These actually represent an indirect attack on the socialist governments which are in the majority in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese socialists are convinced of the need to maintain confidence in this Commission so that the Agenda 2000 reforms could have a more favourable conclusion for the countries of southern Europe than the reforms planned by some of the Member States in northern Europe. We therefore decided to vote in favour of discharge in December"s part‐session. Similarly, now, having achieved the strategic objectives set out, we have decided to support the withdrawal of the motion of censure tabled by the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Portuguese socialists are highly critical of all the Members of all nationalities and of all the political groups that have preferred to go down the destructive road of instability, instead of following the constructive road of serious criticism, which could lead to the reforms that are undoubtedly required.</p>
<p class="contents">The rejection of the motion of censure tabled by the I‐EDN Group, after the Socialist Group had withdrawn its motion, was also an important moment. The results of the vote on this motion of censure – 232 in favour, 293 against and 27 abstentions – show that there are political forces keen to weaken the Commission in this final period of its mandate. Although there were not enough votes to topple the Commission, it must be realised that this vote has serious consequences. During this crisis, the Portuguese socialists have constantly tried to defend the interests of Portugal and the overall interests of Europe, which would certainly not have benefited from the fall of the Commission a few months before the European elections in June.</p>

We believe that any suspicion of irregularities, waste and fraud should be investigated, either by the new independent office for the combating of internal fraud or by the national police authorities. In such cases, the Council should be called upon to make use of Article 160 of the Treaty, which states that any Member of the Commission can be compulsorily retired by the Court of Justice, on application by the Council or the Commission, if he has been guilty of serious misconduct. It is expressly the Council and the Commission itself which have this option, not Parliament, although we could consider including it in a future Treaty amendment. In this way, we can have cases examined thoroughly, without succumbing to the lynch law of the press. However, if this option is to work, Mr Santer will of course have to recognise his accountability as President of the Commission. We shall follow very closely how the Commission keeps to the action plan we have adopted today. The Commission should also consider a redeployment of all the senior officials in the Commission in order to clear the air. We support Mr Liikanen's work on personnel reform, which is key to the whole clearing‐up operation.</p>

<p class="contents">The naming of two Socialist Commissioners was clearly politically motivated. There are equally grave charges of mismanagement against a number of Commissioners from other political families. All these must be thoroughly and swiftly investigated and, if found guilty of gross mismanagement or sleaze, Commissioners must go.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist joint resolution calls for Article 160 of the EC Treaty to be used to get rid of duff Commissioners. I welcome this. But the Commission is a <span class="italic">political</span> body, the European version of a national government. In any democratic national government, ministers who fail to answer the sort of serious charges that have been levelled at some Commissioners would have to resign or face the sack. I hope that the EU can now start to acquire this culture of democratic accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the agreement to set up a committee of independent experts to look at how the Commission manages (or mismanages) its finances and personnel. It is extraordinary, however, that Parliament has found it necessary to establish such a wide‐ranging inquiry. No political system can operate without a reasonable understanding that its executive is honest and competent. The Commission must now ensure that it introduces proper management practices.

It simply proves, once again, that the Commission is still incapable of grasping the political dimension. The Commission has slipped back into a pre‐democratic way of thinking. It has proved incapable of behaving reasonably throughout this disastrous affair.</p>
<p class="contents">We were not just worried about nepotism and corruption. We were also concerned that the Commission has recently become incapable of doing justice to the clear political remit entrusted to it. It was obvious to us that this risks playing into the hands of those who want renationalisation. Because we want a strong Europe and need a strong Commission, we had no option but to express our lack of confidence in this Commission. We hope that the Commission has at last learnt the lesson that we are in a democracy and that it is time to end this pre‐democratic mindset and behaviour. We also hope the Commission will now at last be able to take responsibility for creating a strong Europe without nepotism, corruption and affairs.</p>

That not only undermines the European ideal, it is also a drain on the energy that we need to implement Agenda 2000. I just hope that in view of this vote the Commission will at least have the decency to accept responsibility for its actions and that the Commissioners who stand accused will resign.</p>

They are in fact a result of the nature of the institutional system itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says in its defence that it was overburdened with tasks which it did not have the resources to take on. We reject this false excuse, because the rush to seize powers from the Member States is part of the system itself, which is always seeking to forestall the legitimate defensive reactions of the nations. Moreover, of all the institutions, the Commission has always shown itself to be the most zealous promoter of this deplorable policy. We do not have to go back very far in order to find the Court of Justice ruling of 12 May 1998, which ousted a whole series of budgetary headings that had been put forward by the Commission without a legal basis. Some of these headings, such as the poverty programmes, had even been undertaken when the Council had formally opposed them. Such behaviour, in contempt of the rule of law, is a direct result of the Commission"s sense of superiority towards the nations that make up the Council. The inevitable consequence of this is fraud, and this is the reason for our motion of censure.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutional system has, for a long time, declared the Commission to be the guardian of an interest that is above that of the nations. It has refused to allow the Commission to be monitored, and has used a lack of transparency as a deliberate strategy for achieving integration, and through its central figures has moved around considerable sums of money. A haven for fraud, corruption, waste and nepotism has therefore been created in Brussels, and what was bound to happen has happened. A sordid little world has been built up around the Commission, where influences are traded, far away from the concerns of citizens. We are appalled to see that this little world has been granted considerable powers in initiating legislation and managing Europe. We want to put an end to this system and give the control of the European institutions back to the nations.</p>

I did so, not out of a desire to take part in a witch hunt, and in this respect I regret that Mrs Cresson was too quickly assigned the role of scapegoat. I did it for political reasons, because, at a time when enlargement means that the institutions need to be strengthened, the scenario arrived at by Mr Santer and Mrs Green causes us to turn our backs on that reinforcement.</p>

This Commission has relinquished its independence by placing its future in the hands of a committee of experts. We do not wish to be associated with those of our colleagues who are against a strong Europe, which is why it was so hard for us to vote in favour of the motion. Nevertheless, the question now is how Europe can become stronger. With a weakened Commission that will be unable to provide any real impetus over the next few years, or with a new, dynamic Commission? This was why D66 voted in the end in favour of the motion, but let there be no mistake about it, we want to see greater democracy, greater authority and greater power in Europe, and not weaker European institutions.</p>

<p class="contents">Throughout this crisis of confidence between the European Parliament and the Commission, the French Socialists have firstly tried to secure the collegiality of the Commission and observance of the presumption of innocence. Pigeon shooting is not a method of parliamentary monitoring. They have also tried to show their unity and to find the basis for the widest agreement possible within the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Socialists deplore the fact that the President of the Commission took so long to express the solidarity of the college and to make proposals to Parliament in terms of methods to improve the management of the Commission. They deplore that we had to reach this degree of confusion before the President of that institution finally realised the scale of the malfunctions in the institution for which he was responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">What lessons can we draw from this crisis? The fight against fraud, corruption and irregularities must be pursued with determination, and the means of doing this must be strengthened. The collegiality of the Commission must be consolidated. It is the guarantor of Community integration and the foundation of a common administrative culture. Otherwise, whoever had a majority at any given time could choose whichever Commissioner they liked as a whipping boy to fit in with their electoral calendar. The Commission must have at its head a strong political figure. Today political union is paying for the mistake made by the Council, which, under pressure from the British Conservatives, agreed to nominate a weak President.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now conclude, Mr President. It would have been absurd for the Socialists to have used the strongest political weapon at their disposal in this vote. We have significantly contributed to limiting the damage. There is still a long way to go. The resolution that we have just passed opens the way for this, but the Socialists would like to merit this crazy escalation of events with having revealed the urgent need for a reform of the institutions of the Union before any enlargement can take place.</p>

Indeed, I feel that the crisis situation brought on by the Commission itself, with the support of the Socialist Group, demands a vote of no confidence in order to safeguard the institution.</p>

<p class="contents">President Santer"s proposals aimed at improving the transparency and the running of the Commission come too late and at a time of crisis that does not allow us to evaluate them objectively. The monitoring committee set up by paragraph 1 of the text of the Socialist resolution is placed under the tutelage of the Commission and of Parliament. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate priority today was to re‐establish in the institutional balance the authority of an institution that is, when it is in agreement with the European Parliament, the driving force behind progress in the European Union. This Commission has a duty to be strong, united, independent, respected by the Council, by Parliament and by the citizens of Europe.</p>

This has somewhat obscured the fact that a motion of censure is actually a very simple question. The question is: do the elected representatives of the people still have sufficient confidence in the leadership of the central executive body of the European Union? The answer to this question has to be either yes or no. And in my opinion, anyone who listened to Mr Santer on Monday, anyone who has listened to him in recent weeks and has witnessed his behaviour here today, is bound to conclude that given the important tasks ahead of us we can no longer have faith in the leadership abilities of this Commission and its President.</p>
<p class="contents">That was what Parliament needed to make a decision about, not about tactical trickery. This is also the overwhelming view of my social democrat colleagues in the Federal Republic of Germany. That is why we could see no alternative but to fulfil our parliamentary duty and tell the central administrative institution of the European Union that it is not people who express a lack of confidence who cause an institutional crisis, but people who fail to carry out their distinguished and important duties fully and adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">The leader of my group has told us that she has withdrawn the motion of censure submitted by the Socialist Group. That is not correct. The motion was submitted by individual members of the Socialist Group. I would like that to be minuted.</p>

<p class="contents">Today's events have demonstrated that there is still an unfortunate lack of democracy in Europe's institutions. We need to reform these institutions if Europe is to make real political progress. The Tindemans Plan provided us with a model that is just as relevant to the current situation as it was all those years ago. So we do not need to conduct a great deal of research or set up token committees of wise men in order to achieve a substantial reform in the near future. That is the task facing Parliament in view of today's events. In this way, in the not too distant future it will be possible – God willing – for a united and enlarged Europe satisfactorily to accomplish its task not only on behalf of the people of Europe but also in the interest of world peace.</p>

<p class="contents">I must begin by calling on Parliament to have a little modesty. Last night, at 9 p.m., a debate was opened here on an own‐initiative report by my friend and fellow countryman, Mr Areitio. Mr Van Miert responded for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, do you know how many Members were here in this Hemicycle with Mr Areitio at 9 p.m. last night? There were none. Can this Parliament therefore cast the first stone?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, can we cast an individual stone at any of the Commissioners when we know perfectly well that the College of Commissioners is exactly that, a college, a single unit, and that – whether we like it or not – those are the rules and we have to respect them?</p>
<p class="contents">There are obviously a lot of things that need to be put right. And I believe that the Commission, presided over by a man of honour, Mr Santer, will keep its promises and make the necessary changes to a system of management that, as we know, is far from perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a time when certain Israelites – those in the Bible, not the Israelis – wanted to demolish the temple, and they succeeded in doing so. But the cost of this was that the Philistines and Samson died. As I said to my group, the Philistines are of no importance to me, neither those in my group nor in the others. And Samson is scarcely of any concern to me. However, what does matter to me is the survival of our temple that has cost us so much to build.</p>

<p class="contents">The Santer Commission has submitted Agenda 2000 to us. It is up to this Parliament to deal with these important Agenda 2000 proposals, on which the welfare of hundreds of millions of Europeans depends, and which should concern us a lot more than the nepotism of which Mrs Cresson and others are accused.

All the complications and mess that came to light over the 1996 discharge were supposed to be swept away by means of a vote of confidence, but there has not been a vote of confidence. I too see a committee of wise men as a poor substitute. We must take this opportunity to make sure that this Commission – which I have already heard described in the corridors as a ‘dead man walking' – now at least does whatever is necessary to achieve what Mr Martens rather pompously promised us here: an end to bureaucracy and technocracy.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament had not voted in such great numbers to express its lack of confidence, the Commission would have sat back and said it was just a storm in a teacup. That is why I am glad – and I thought long and hard about this – to have supported this initiative and that we have effectively had a vote of no‐confidence. I would like to stress once again – and Mr Berthu can confirm this – that the aim of this initiative was to ensure a strong Commission and a true parliamentary system for Europe, and to make sure that we stop resorting to technocratic and bureaucratic practices, combined with a lack of transparency, to hush up shortcomings in Europe. Lack of transparency is the real cardinal sin, though this does not mean that we can afford to be complacent about nepotism, mismanagement and fraud.</p>

The Commission has been wounded by this debate, and politically speaking it is dead in the water. The fact that there was in effect a grand coalition between the majority groups makes the large number of Members who supported the motion of censure all the more significant. Considering that in comparison with the BSE motion of censure the number supporting the censure vote has almost doubled, there is every reason to claim that confidence in the European Commission has eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that the European Parliament has taken two steps forward and one step back: having launched itself into the air like a roaring tiger, it has come down to earth again with a sad bump. It is regrettable that the European Parliament has relinquished its right of control to a ‘committee of experts', thus depriving itself of its own rights. I hope that will not mean that the European Parliament loses credibility, and I particularly regret the tactical manoeuvring of the majority groups. Although there was wide support for the motion of censure, this is not the place for detailed discussion of the role of the committee of wise men – today should have been a day of political reckoning. So as a co‐signatory I am satisfied with the outcome of the motion of censure, which I think has given the Commission a great deal of food for thought.</p>

The motion on which we are now voting is not a motion of confidence as the Rules do not allow this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this whole process from its beginning in the last part‐session up to today has been rather muddled and I regard it as basic justice to now hold the PSE and its chairman responsible for the current situation which is not helping the European Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the way in which I am voting is plainly based on reasons of state and simple national interest, which can also apply within the European Union. This genuinely Dantesque process consisting of somewhat shadowy intentions is, in my opinion, hiding rather undignified manoeuvres and simply intolerable objectives. We must remember that important negotiations are about to take place, particularly with Agenda 2000 and the Structural and Cohesion Funds, in which the poorest countries, including Portugal, are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I consider it my duty to support the view that this Commission has not fulfilled its stipulated role, as I understand it, particularly with regard to the lack of transparency and total disregard for the ‘principle of good financial management", not to mention, for example, the recurring suspicions of fraud and the infamous case of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am voting against this motion of censure, but I must repeat that this vote must not be taken as a vote of confidence in this Commission.</p>

I will nevertheless add that I did in fact sign the motion of censure, along with Mr Mégret and Mr Le Gallou, at the express request of Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy, who then decided to withdraw our signatures without consulting us, an action which I publicly deplore.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to note that the Christian Democrats of the PPE and their allies, along with the Socialists, make up a real block that supports the Commission in and against everything. We are well aware that this outrageous alliance between those who claim to be right‐wing and those who say they are left‐wing gives the Commission a theoretical majority. In my opinion, this is a failure for democracy. Europe is revealing itself as what it is: a technocratic and oligarchical organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a Europe, the interests of citizens, and thus of taxpayers, are censured to some degree. By not censuring the Commission, I feel that the majority of this Parliament has in fact chosen to censure the interests of the people, and notably those of the French people. Obviously, I deplore this.</p>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has put forward a programme with an appropriate timetable to tackle the problem of fraud in cooperation with our own Parliament. Added to this, as I do not agree with accusing individual Commissioners without an in‐depth investigation into their guilt, I could not in all conscience vote for the motions of censure that have this intention.</p>

Following the introduction of the euro, we are now facing the challenge of Agenda 2000, the reform of the CAP, enlargement and the Structural Funds, all of which are of enormous importance, particularly for the cohesion countries.</p>

<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we welcomed the eight‐part plan presented to Parliament by President Santer on Monday. The measures for financial and administrative reorganisation advocated in the Socialist resolution are along the same lines as the plan put forward by the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we clearly and plainly rejected censure of the Commission in order to affirm its mandate. If we want the Commission to improve its management, we need to give it the time to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike some, who took advantage of the vote on discharge in order to weaken the Commission, the Socialists have always insisted on the need for a Commission that remains strong and operational right to the end of its mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist motion of censure was a motion of confirmation of the Commission. President Santer had himself requested it, the day before the vote on discharge, in December, in order to clarify relations between Parliament and the Commission. Without this political initiative on the part of the Socialists, the measures announced by Jacques Santer would never have seen the light of day.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the debates on this motion have led to the formation of a coalition in the European Parliament that is hostile to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This incongruous coalition goes from the CDU and the Bavarian CSU (whose vice‐president signed the motion of censure from the anti‐Maastricht right), through the Liberals, to the Greens and the extreme right‐wing. Six months away from the elections, it wants to benefit at all costs from an unparalleled witch hunt that, through the most absurd rumours, is even affecting President Santer himself.</p>
<p class="contents">This irresponsible coalition has damaged not only the prestige of the Commission, but also the European Union itself, as a result of its extraordinarily relentless attack on a Commission whose political record, at the time of the introduction of the euro, is largely positive.</p>

It is a political vote for a strong Parliament in the European Union, which can intervene decisively and boldly in what is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention of this vote is not to cast doubt on the trustworthiness of the Commissioners collectively or individually.

<p class="contents">There is a difference between blame and accountability. You can have accountability without having blame. The June Movement and the People's Movement do not have an opinion about who is to blame. We leave that to disciplinary proceedings and the Court of Justice. We are voting to censure the Commission as a college because the Commission is accountable and must accept responsibility for the fact that so much has gone wrong and will continue to go wrong. If the political leadership does not accept accountability, then there is no accountability. The EU's budget would then become a matter of helping oneself.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem is that Mr Santer and his colleagues are not leading, but are allowing themselves to be led into a muddle of waste, fraud and corruption. Mr Santer is a prisoner in his own fortress. The Personnel Commissioner is a prisoner. The Director of Personnel is a prisoner. Only a motion of censure will release the prisoners and create a new culture of openness, closeness to the people and democracy, instead of secrecy, arrogance and bureaucracy. Mr Santer reacted firmly when he should not have done, but he was not firm when he should have been. He sacked an official for giving a document to an elected representative. He ought to have sacked the people who prevent elected representatives from obtaining what they ask for. That is why the June Movement and the People's Movement wish to sack Mr Santer's Commission today.</p>

<p class="contents">This lack of rigour, which leads to waste and damages the interests and the image of the European Union, is in itself a reason to express our lack of trust in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to this is added the Commission"s politically unacceptable handling of the conflict with Parliament: a refusal to hand over documents, political cant, even arrogance, which reveal a culture of impunity that is present throughout the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Repetitive speeches from the Commission about transparency and the desire for ‘open cooperation" with Parliament disguise an ever present reality. There is often only transparency concerning widely‐known issues and those on which Members have had to prise out information. Cooperation is only rhetoric: we have lost count of the number of resolutions from Parliament that have still not yielded results, even when they have been adopted by a large majority, and Parliament is frequently kept at arm"s length when it comes to burning issues such as transatlantic relations and trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people cite the Commission"s supposed efficiency in its role as the driving force behind the Union and the guardian of the Treaties. The current Commission demonstrates varying levels of rigour: at the will of Mr Van Miert, it niggles over public aid and suspicions of distortion of competition, but it is more than reserved, if not silent, when it comes to implicating certain Member States. For example, the attitude of the British Government in operation ‘Desert Fox" is a violation of Article J of the Treaty, and with regard to the ‘<span class="italic">Echelon"</span> affair, the Commission quite simply refuses to give an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The current breaches in terms of management, transparency, coherence and political initiative are of a structural nature: it is the Commission as a whole that is in question and not only one or two Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who talk about a political void in the event of censure are wrong. It is true that it brings on a political crisis, but it is a useful crisis. In fact, it is an illusion to believe that the Commission can still play a significant role in the various challenges with which the Union is faced (reform of the CAP and of the Structural Funds, the funding of the Union, enlargement) with the team of Commissioners currently in place. The Santer Commission, which was already politically weak from the start, has lost its credibility and its authority!</p>
<p class="contents">The best thing it can do for the European Union is to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has the opportunity to send a strong signal to European public opinion by censuring the Commission: the time has come to admit that the European institutions are operating in an obsolete manner. The time has come to make the European institutions, and particularly the Commission, whose hybrid status must be reviewed, more efficient and above all more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Censuring the Commission is not a solution in itself, but it is the necessary condition for change.</p>

<p class="contents">However, it should be emphasised that the suspicions of fraud, mismanagement and maladministration that surround the Commission provide grounds for justified and heavy criticism. The Commission has dealt with the many incidences of neglect in a cumbersome way, while at the same time trying to cover up mistakes. With the facts that have come to light we have not been able to declare our total confidence in the way the Commission goes about its important work and sees to its enormous responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above we considered that it would be best for us to abstain in the vote on the censure motion.

However, the individual Commissioners have taken shelter behind the Commission as a whole, so it has not been possible to impose accountability on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission, Mr Santer, has not shown understanding of the criticism which has been made. Thus the Commission as a whole has assumed responsibility for all the criticism which has been directed at the Commission by the Court of Auditors, Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control and a large number of Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore voted in favour of the motion of censure against the Commission. The failings and irregularities which have been discovered are now being put right, in the interest of everyone.</p>

<p class="contents">In December, the Commission itself, in a flight of rhetoric, inappropriately dubbed the refusal of a majority in the Parliament to give it a discharge in respect of the 1996 budget as a ‘crisis of faith'. At the time of that vote, the leader of the Socialist Group, Mrs Green, gave notice of a motion of censure in the hope of effectively achieving a vote of confidence for lack of sufficient votes. Her feeble tactics, including her theatrical withdrawal of the motion of censure today, will not be forgotten in the forthcoming European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The two Socialist Commissioners who stand accused, Mrs Cresson and Mr Marín, have not acceded to the request that they should resign, which was supported by a large majority of the PPE Group and unanimously by the German group of Christian Democrats. Confidence in the present Commission has therefore been permanently damaged, as demonstrated by the result of the vote, 232 to 293.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Cresson is responsible for the lamentable management of Leonardo, and for mismanagement of funds, nepotism and considerable irregularities in the commissioning of external consultants. Similarly, Mr Marín has failed to demonstrate economical management and effective implementation of funds and financial control in accordance with regulations. Neither has so far been prepared to accept full responsibility for their actions. Furthermore, last week Mrs Cresson again repeatedly demonstrated her contempt for the European Parliament. Her attempt to trivialise accusations of fraud and to portray herself as the ‘victim' of ‘conspiracies' originating in Germany is laughable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has had time enough to root out these problems, as the European Parliament decided to defer the discharge back in March 1998. So far, there has been no sign of any follow‐up regarding the serious errors made in managing external policies such as ECHO, MED, PHARE and TACIS or the suspicions of corruption on the part of officials. We have not been given a relevant list of all internal investigations on fraud prevention, and the European Parliament's democratic control has been hindered by documents being withheld, censored or forged.</p>
<p class="contents">During today's voting I also voted again the committee of wise men suggested by the Commission President in his eight‐point plan. We do not need an additional outside committee of inquiry that will not be able to complete its work in just a few weeks anyway. I regret this majority decision, which is tantamount to the European Parliament depriving itself of its own rights. In addition to the European Court of Auditors there is another powerful monitoring body, the European Parliament's own Committee on Budgetary Control. That committee is the place for financial investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of a strong European Commission, but it will only remain efficient and effective if it is cleaned up. It would have been in the Commission's own interest to clear up irregularities, sack corrupt officials and protect those officials who are competent, conscientious and reliable. It needs to reform itself from within by means of a code of conduct on the appointment of senior officials and appropriate staff regulations. The culture of cronyism and hiding behind collective decision‐making has to come to an end. Every member of the Commission must be prepared willing to answer for his area of responsibility. Our citizens have a right to expect a transparent, fair and hard‐working Europe which manages the funds entrusted to it with due care. They also have a right to expect Members of Parliament to exercise their control functions without resorting to party‐political tactics.</p>

<p class="contents">Between 1989 and 1992, the European Commission blithely allowed Great Britain to poison millions of cows. 146 000 British cows were destroyed without Brussels batting an eyelid. Contaminated feed continued to be in circulation, and the European Commission still said nothing. Several tens of cases of Creutzfeldt‐Jacob"s disease were declared, condemning young Europeans because the cattle disease had perhaps been transmitted to humans. In any case, the risk was knowingly taken to contaminate millions of human beings. This was done by the European Commission. This health risk was taken by the Commission. Let us not mince our words: in this affair the Commission"s attitude was more than negligent, it was an irresponsible and criminal attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the European Parliament did not punish the Commission. The motion of censure of 20 February 1997 concerning mad cow disease was not passed.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in 1992 the European Commission, going beyond its powers, did not hesitate to secretly sign the Blair House agreement with the United States, an agreement that sacrificed the agricultural interests of Europe and of our farmers. There was no punishment in this case either.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, in the Central American bananas affair, the Commission in Brussels, on its own initiative, made a gift of 12 billion francs" worth of annual customs duties, to the sole benefit of three American multinationals: Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte.</p>
<p class="contents">No motion of censure was tabled, and there was not even a single sign of indignation. However, for the 3.9 million francs of humanitarian funds for the Balkans and for two of Edith Cresson"s friends, hidden away in her office, the European Commission is finally inciting disapproval.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a system in which the poisoning of cows leaves us cold, where we are indifferent to a gift of 12 billion francs, but where the quiet fraud of a good traditional Socialist and the good kleptomaniac habits of 1980s socialism provoke reactions, which this time are heated reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is confirmation of the principal that he who is not punished for a greater crime will be punished for a lesser crime. But better late than never.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, Al Capone was only convicted of tax fraud, after having escaped any punishment for murder, violence, robbery and organised crime.</p>

<p class="contents">It was necessary to threaten the Commission with the sack in order to ensure that Parliament's demands for more scrutiny of budgetary procedures and financial management were met, and to force the Commission to undertake a root‐and‐branch review of the Commission's management of taxpayers' money. There can be no tolerance in the Commission of fraud, corruption or financial irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">President Santer has accepted reforms proposed by the leader of the EPLP, Alan Donnelly. In particular, a panel of experts to scrutinise finances will provide for ongoing rather than retrospective scrutiny allowing a rapid response to any irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">This will begin the process of restoring public confidence, but we have to acknowledge as must the Commission that this has been a real crisis of confidence and that strenuous efforts must be made to overcome the credibility gap.</p>
<p class="contents">As Labour's regional spokesperson, I will be calling for a standing item on the Committee on Regional Policy's agenda on budgetary implementation and scrutiny, and look forward to working closely with the Commission on monitoring funding under European regional grants so as to ensure transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">To have voted for Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy's motion of censure to sack the Commission today, at the critical juncture when the Commission needs to be capable of taking major decisions on Agenda 2000 and reform of regional grants, could have thrown this decision‐making process into paralysis. This would have jeopardised timetables and led to potential delays for future European programmes. It would be irresponsible to leave our needy regions in Britain with uncertainty and insecurity over future grants. Our demands have been met and now it is our duty to see the Commission pledges and rhetoric translated into action. I stress this is only the beginning of a process of stricter and more rigorous financial control and accountability.</p>

This is the first time that a motion of censure has obtained such a high score.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the manoeuvres of the two main groups in the European Parliament that were completely opposed to censure, 232 Members (out of the 552 who are present), including all the French Communist and allied Members, and the great majority of the GUE/NGL Group, voted for censure.</p>
<p class="contents">This demonstrates the strong discontent that is developing in the Union with regard to the ultra‐liberal choices, the excessive role and the arrogant practices of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The GUE/NGL Group also wanted to outplay the manoeuvres from the right‐wing, attempting to release the Commission from its responsibilities by solely accusing two Socialist Commissioners.

<p class="contents">The European Parliament"s Committee on Budgetary Control must be able to complete its investigation into the suspicions of malpractice by the Commission relating to the 1996 discharge. It is important that it should do so by mid‐March of this year while the present Commission"s term and this Parliament"s term are still running.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must make an agreement of trust among the EU"s institutions – the Council of Ministers, the Commission, and Parliament – as Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the Federal Republic of Germany, the country currently holding the EU presidency, has proposed. An agreement of trust must be brought into place as swiftly as possible, so that the errors that have arisen during this process, that was so carelessly handled, can be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">As there is clear evidence in this case and grounds for suspecting the Commission of maladministration, an independent body should be set up to look into and report on everything the Commission is suspected of.

<p class="contents">But in this case it is not the Commission we are calling upon to discharge its duties properly, but rather the individual Member States, who have failed to equip their administrations so as to enhance European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Court of Auditors and the European Parliament have repeatedly called for improved and more rapid checks, it is obvious that the Member States do not have the will to act here.</p>
<p class="contents">Remedial action is called for. This cannot be achieved by sacking the Santer Commission. Of course, it would have been in the interest of the Commission as a whole if a couple of Commissioners had accepted political responsibility for their actions, but as they have not done so, we shall in future have to find a way of avoiding a cliff‐hanging censure vote potentially leading to the removal of the entire Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">The repeated scandals that tarnish the Commission in all its fields of intervention are not a matter of chance: they are the result of a system that the Member States have allowed to develop, the structure of which breeds corruption. This system could be considered to be an actual distortion of democracy, because the result of it is that the responsibilities entrusted by the people to the governments that they elect are in fact carried out, through the Commission, by subcontractors that are not monitored by anyone: consultancy firms, ad hoc service companies, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we do need to review the European institutions, but this review needs to be in‐depth: that is what we mean when we talk about the need to build ‘another Europe". We mean that we must put an end to this absurd process that involves the Member States relinquishing powers to a Commission that is so greedy for powers that it is incapable of exercising them. The solution does not lie in unmonitored sub‐contracting, which leads to wastage and fraud at the expense of the taxpayers in our Member States, nor does it lie in constructing a federal super‐bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fraud that we are discovering and condemning today is nothing more than the result of applying the federalist dogma of the Commission"s sacrosanct independence from the Member States. Under the cover of this ‘independence", there has been a quite natural development of the habit of exercising uncontrolled power, a culture of non‐transparency, nepotism and arrogance, a society in which there is connivance and complacency, and a contempt for the rule of law. It is a closed world, cut off from the people and from their representatives, and it thinks that it is allowed to do anything: in short, it is the opposite of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to move towards a complete reorientation of European construction if we really want to put an end to this drifting off course of the institutions of the Union that is discrediting the very idea of Europe. The Member States in the Council must forcibly regain control of the Commission. Their past laxity, in thoughtlessly allowing a body to develop outside any control, by shirking their responsibilities and giving in to the Commission"s bulimic appetite for power, has endangered the future construction of Europe. In order to clean the Augean stables, there is today no path to take other than that of setting to work on a Europe that is truly democratic and transparent. The current system has shown itself to be incapable of reforming itself and incapable of taking account of the desire for reform expressed by the European Parliament: we only have to look at what became of the conclusions of our first two committees of inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission only finds the energy to condemn those within it that advocate transparency, from Bernard Connolly to Paul van Buitenen. Obviously, the little plans concocted between the President of the Commission and the Socialist Group to set up not a parliamentary committee of inquiry, but a committee of experts, on the appointment of which the Commission will have a right of veto, are not the worst of the problems to be solved in order to enable us to break the deadlock that is currently blocking the construction of Europe.</p>

My decision was guided by the fact that the final negotiations on the budget, structural policy and agricultural policy should be able to be completed as soon as possible. This is in Finland's interests, especially as far as agricultural policy is concerned. The issue now is one of recognising responsibility and not of demonstrating power, which has wrongly become an issue for many Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to continue the battle against abuses in the EU, to achieve a sound administrative structure and to move away from blaming others, the Commissioners should be personally accountable. The struggle for a better and more open administration is the key. That is another reason why I have given my support to the ideas in the resolution from the Liberal Group. It is also in line with the administrative reforms which have already started.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the Commission has made substantial progress in cleaning up its administration. The fact that mistakes have been uncovered is largely due to increased efforts to bring about a sound and healthy administration. What has been uncovered is mainly mismanagement, and fortunately not many cases of fraud.</p>

<p class="contents">The author of the report put forward an excellent proposal, now referred to as paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Elles report. He suggested a work programme that the Commission would have to fulfil by certain predetermined dates, thus allowing Parliament both to keep the debate open and to demand that the Commission put its house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group wanted to close the debate and tabled a motion of censure which it itself was not prepared to vote for. The motion resulted in the over‐politicisation of the entire issue and, even worse, produced a result that was weaker than the proposals in the Elles report. The committee of experts is a capitulation by the European Parliament. Things should not have been allowed to get this far.</p>

The debates did not provide any new proof, any evidence, or any sound arguments. I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the motion of censure.</p>
<p class="contents">Great political and institutional confusion has arisen. Public opinion has received a very negative impression of the European institutions. The same old anti‐Europeans have made use of the occasion to damage the stability of the European integration project.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration has not been given to an essential reality of the constitutional and administrative doctrine: that we must differentiate between the responsibilities of government and the responsibilities of administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also forgotten about the spirit and letter of the Treaty on European Union. The European Parliament has the ability to monitor all the European Commission"s activities on a daily basis. This is one of Parliament"s roles, which we carry out through oral and written questions and the periodic reports on the management of the European Union"s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the European Parliament has power to vote for a motion of censure to prevent the European Commission from continuing in office. However, this crucial power must be used to assess serious incidences of negligence in the Commission"s essential institutional responsibilities, which, basically, are its ability to initiate legislation and its responsibility as guardian of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the world, public opinion is aware that in recent years, the European Union has reached a high level of development and achieved some revolutionary goals. The launch of the single currency has been a vital success. The launch of negotiations to enlarge the European Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will lead us to a united Europe, a revolutionary institutional model and a factor for global peace and prosperity. The debate on Agenda 2000 is also underway and will put Europe in a position to face the challenges of the next seven years successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">Give all these successes, it would be irresponsible to censure the European Commission, which is undeniably the driving force behind the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not prevent us in the European Parliament from continuing with our task of strictly monitoring all the Commission"s activities, and this includes the demand to improve its management structures. I personally have been calling for changes in the Commission"s procedures for the last 12 years. Among other proposals, we have been asked to approve rules on administrative procedure and administrative justice, an area where there is a great vacuum in Community legislation. These rules will provide legal certainty for citizens, as well as increasing efficiency and transparency. At the same time, they will be an essential instrument in tackling the problems in the economic and administrative management of the European Commission. They will also allow us to distinguish, with legal certainty, between the economic and administrative responsibilities and the major political and institutional responsibilities, to which the final and most serious response is the motion of censure.</p>
