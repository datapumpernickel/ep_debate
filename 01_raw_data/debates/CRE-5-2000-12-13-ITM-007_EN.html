<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, in this joint debate we are going to discuss three reports which relate to four Commission proposals, which means that I have an unusual number of roles to play. I am rapporteur for two of them, I am shadow rapporteur for Mrs Torres Marques’s report and I am tabling amendments to the report on aviation fuel, because I do not agree with some of the ideas which were approved in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The second peculiarity, as you will have the opportunity to discover, is that I am in an unusual position within my own group. My military career was neither long nor distinguished, but I did learn that the role of the artillery was to bombard the infantry, if possible, the enemy infantry. I fear that I am currently trapped in my group’s own crossfire.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start by discussing the first of the reports, which relates to VAT on e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal which the Commission has referred to Parliament has, in my opinion, a priority objective: to remedy the discriminatory situation currently suffered by European e-commerce companies in comparison to companies from third countries. E-commerce refers to the provision of services delivered by Internet and radio and TV services provided by subscription or ‘pay per view’. I am stressing this because some of the amendments intend to establish a zero rate of VAT for services which, in my opinion, are not of an essential or social nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also has other secondary objectives, in accordance with the traditional thinking of ministries of finance: to achieve this objective – that of ending this discrimination – by simplifying the tax, making it considerably more effective in terms of the recovery and reduction of the administrative costs relating to the collection of taxes, to achieve the objectives of efficiency and fairness and to achieve, finally, the modernisation of the tax system. These objectives, the main one and the secondary ones, will be the touchstone by which the concrete proposals submitted by the Commission must be judged.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, I said that the first of these criteria by which we must judge this proposal is the need to end the discrimination suffered by European companies in comparison with third countries. This discrimination comes about because Article 9 of the sixth directive establishes the presumption that the place where the service is provided is the address where the service provider is officially established. In other words, at the moment European companies are subject to VAT when they provide electronic services, whether that be inside or outside the Union. On the other hand, companies established outside the Union never pay VAT, whether they are providing services to European clients or to clients in other parts of the world, thereby harming our competitiveness in external markets.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up and to put it very simply, the services provided by European companies currently suffer a tax burden which is not suffered by third country companies who provide services within the Union. Therefore, current European legislation encourages European e-commerce companies to establish themselves outside the Community. Some of the arguments which we will hear in the course of this afternoon will say that burdening outside companies which provide services within the Union would put a brake on the growth of e-commerce, but precisely the opposite is true, since maintaining this state of affairs harms the growth of the European e-commerce industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree on this, both on this side and on the other side of the Atlantic. We are so much in agreement that, at the Ottawa Conference in 1998, three conclusions were reached which I consider to be important: firstly, national taxes on consumption must be applied to consumption which takes place within national territory. Secondly, the provision of digital products constitutes a provision of services rather than a delivery of goods. Thirdly, we must turn to simple formulae for recovering taxes and, specifically, the reversal of the taxable person.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this objective, and with this international legal framework agreed by everybody in Ottawa, the Commission proposes the amendment of the sixth directive to lay down that digital services should be established in the place where the receiver is established rather than the provider.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, services provided by European companies to non-European companies would always be exempt from the tax, which would revive our international competitiveness. Secondly, services provided by European companies to European customers would be subject to tax, as is normal. And thirdly, services provided by non-European companies to European companies would also be subject to tax, which establishes equality of conditions, in other words, fair play, on an international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem does not stem transactions between companies, but occurs when the receiver of the service is a private individual, and here the Commission is doing the only thing it can do: oblige non-EU companies to register in a country of the European Union so that from there, with a Community passport, it can provide services to the whole of the Union, while having to pay the same tax as the European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this solution resolves the problem of eliminating previous discrimination and achieves the objective of simplification. A company only has to register in one country of the Union. It does not have to register in fifteen, it does not have to understand fifteen different sets of legislation and does not have to struggle with fifteen administrations. However, it does not resolve the problem of fairness. We know that a solution such as this – establishment in one country with the opportunity to provide services to the whole of the Union – could lead to an avalanche towards those countries with the lowest taxes. The French Presidency therefore proposed that non-EU companies providing services in the Union should have to register in all fifteen countries, which contradicts the objective of simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission propose? The Commission proposes, respecting the objective of simplification, a single place of establishment, but that the tax recovered by the Treasury of that country should be redistributed amongst the other countries of the Union, in accordance with the relative consumption. That is exactly the formula which will enable the introduction of VAT at source, it is exactly the formula which we have decided for cross-border returns of VAT and it is exactly the formula Ecofin has approved, in accordance with the Feira conclusions, in the case of withholding taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this Commission communication complete? It is not. There are certain problems which I have highlighted in the explanatory statement, such as ensuring that a company which can provide services from outside the Union is registered.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we guarantee that there is no discrimination between similar products? Digital service, the consultation of or access to a book or a magazine, would be taxed at the normal rate if this were done via the Internet, whereas it would be subject to a lower rate when it is supplied physically.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we resolve the problems of identifying the client? The responses contained in the Commission’s proposal seems to me to be adequate, and in any event, Mr President, these difficulties are clearly not exclusive to the taxation of digital services. VAT is a tax that was intended to cover the movement of goods and does not suit the provision of services, especially a phenomenon as new as Internet services.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of the reports I am going to refer to deals with the problem of hydrocarbons, and the issue is very simple. The 1992 Directive established a mandatory exemption for fuels used in international aviation and, at the same time, established a review of the exemption in order to take account of environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal difficulties for this revision are found in the 1944 Chicago Convention, an international obligation, which exempts on-board fuel supplied to aircraft from tax, and the bilateral agreements. Faced with this situation, the Commission ordered a study, which is the one we are investigating here, on what can be done. The first conclusion is that little can be done until the international framework is modified. The second conclusion reached by the Commission is that it would be desirable to have a tax on national flights and on intra-Community flights, subject to modification of the bilateral agreements, which is something I do not agree with. Thirdly, and this I do agree with, the need – within the international framework of the ICAO – to make all the progress necessary to establish a tax which is world-wide, and therefore not discriminatory, on Community transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, having abused your patience, I impatiently await the criticisms and comments of the other Members, both from my group and from others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in fact, an important tool in the building of the internal market and also a substantial source of revenue in the Community budget. Thus, in 1992, an agreement was reached, at the time considered a minimum harmonisation, by which the standard rate for VAT could not be less than 15% and the Member States would have the power to apply one or more reduced rates of not less than 5%, with, however, derogations provided for in this case. But this first stage should have lasted only until the end of 1996, when the definitive system was to come in. The proposals submitted in the meantime only led to the floor of the standard rate of VAT being fixed at 15% – although the Commission had also proposed a ceiling of 25%, which was not accepted – and to the system being extended until the end of 2000. Now that we have come to the end of this year, the Commission proposes we should follow two paths in this field: the first is dealt with in my colleague, García-Margallo y Marfil’s report on the coordination of VAT administrative systems; the second is dealt with in this report, and seeks to put off any decision on the subject of VAT rate harmonisation until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">While I agree with the proposals for coordinating the administrative systems for levying VAT, I do not agree, and neither does the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with the proposal to postpone the harmonisation process for five years. Has the Commission given up advancing this dossier for the whole length of its mandate? Does the Commission not consider, as we do, that the existence of the euro as the forthcoming single currency in twelve European Union states will lead to price transparency that will show up the distortion introduced into the internal market by the existence of such disparities among the rates applied in the various countries of the Union? Does this Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Frederik Bolkestein, consider this to be a case of tax competition that he wishes to maintain or even encourage through his report? This is not our view, and we have therefore voted to bring this deadline forward to the end of 2003 so that, once the euro has been in practical usage for two years, new solutions can be put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, in keeping with the positions adopted in this Parliament, I propose that the references to the need for voting in the Council on this subject to be unanimous should be removed. If the Treaties continue to require this, so be it. But, as I see it, nothing forces the Commission and Parliament to lay down now that, at the end of 2005, the Council vote on this subject has to be unanimous. Such a proposal is not in line with the principles put forward either by the Commission or by Parliament for the IGC that has just finished. There is even less justification for deciding now that it must be so until the end of 2005, when we know that there will be another review of the Treaties in the meantime. Therefore, we also propose removing this requirement for unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let us say that we do not like to see the Commission giving up completely on VAT harmonisation at the beginning of its mandate, and Parliament, understanding the need to extend the validity of the legislation in force, being left waiting for the Commission, in the middle of its mandate and with the euro already in circulation, to present us with a new, full and thorough proposal on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would like to add educational services to that. They disadvantage people inside the EU because they currently pay VAT for the supply of these services whereas those outside the European Union do not. This is why we believe that this directive needs to come into force with some urgency, particularly those of us who believe that there will be a rapid rise in e<span class="italic">-</span>commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">The Industry Committee adopted a number of proposals by thirty-nine votes to three. We asked for registration in a single Member State. We called for the European Commission to monitor to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to report back to the Council and to Parliament. We asked them to report, in the meantime, on a number of aspects: ensuring equal treatment of companies, looking at the choice of location, harmonising of international regulations and the possibility of establishing a clearing system, as was suggested by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point we made, that was not made elsewhere, was that, as many may recall, Al Capone was gaoled not as a gangster but for tax evasion. We see an unfortunate boom in aspects of e-commerce, in the growth of pornography, paedophilia and race-hate material. The Industry Committee believes that registration for VAT will enable us to subject the companies concerned to the rigours of EU law on these matters. This in itself may make the directive worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the face of it this proposal would seem to be about taxation of non-EU businesses, but, of course, what it should be about is how we encourage and nurture Europe's e-economy, which is a very fragile flower. In this sense, I welcome the Commission's brave attempt to find a way to close the competitive gap that clearly exists between EU and non-EU e-business. But what we have to ask, and what our committee asked, was: is this the right way to do it? Our opinion was very clearly that it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">I was always told that one of the first rules or principles of a legislator should be: do not make law you cannot enforce. This was our committee's major concern. It may not be enough to rely on the good will of enterprises outside our reach. The good guys will comply, the bad ones will still be bad, and consumers may well use them in their search for a good deal.</p>
<p class="contents">What else could we be doing here? There is much talk about setting up business models for e-commerce regulation, but that is a wider issue and should be dealt with in a much more transparent way. There are underlying assumptions in this proposal about the place of taxation which could store up problems for the future in an international context. We may have something to learn from America, where they have, of course, imposed a moratorium on such e-tax. In short, the aim of this proposal is correct but the method is misconceived and if we really want to encourage Europe's e-economy, a right signal would be zero rate VAT for our own e-business rather than trying to impose our problems on others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While road transport pays a hefty fuel tax, commercial aviation is exempt from this. The directive concerned provides for the possibility, in future, of amending or abolishing this exemption, based on external costs and environmental damage. For the time being, bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries are precluding a levy on kerosene for international flights. A levy on aviation is of crucial importance, both on account of the ‘polluter-pays’ principle and equal competitive conditions for various modes of transport. The efforts of the members of the ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, should therefore be geared towards opening up this possibility, for which an opportunity will arise next autumn during the 33rd general meeting. For a variety of reasons, such as noise pollution, air pollution and energy consumption, the discouragement of shorter flights, certainly domestic flights, deserves much attention. As and when the train offers an equivalent alternative on an increasing number of routes, this alternative can be promoted. I am thrilled by the fact that, partly thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a number of important elements are once again brought to the fore in the report. Due to events occurring at the time, these elements met with less than adequate support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that fuel for road transport is about three times more expensive than aircraft fuel, is striking, to say the least. Add to this the unruly increase in the number of flights, including short-haul flights, and the question arises as to where all of this will end. In business and leisure travel alike, people must be able to choose on the basis of honest competitive conditions. But at the same time, people, including those who never fly, are entitled to expect noise, air and other pollution to be kept down to an absolute minimum. Plenty of reason, therefore, to take a close look at whether aviation is carrying its external costs and not prejudicing the train or bus owing to unfair competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have, on the whole, taken on board the arguments that I have presented.</p>
<p class="contents">Aircraft are currently the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases. It is estimated that around 5 percent come from aeroplanes. The number of flights is also expected to double in around 15 years.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be able to live up to the requirements for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases we must take every measure possible to limit them. An example of such a measure is to make more use of financial instruments of control. As Mr Van Dam has also said, aircraft fuel should therefore not be exempt from tax. The Commission’s communication states that the effect is so small that it is not worth doing anything about it. I object to this line of reasoning. Aviation is a fast growing sector. If the effect is small today, it will, in any case, be larger tomorrow. This kind of reasoning is dangerous because it can easily lead to a situation in which no one does anything anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We must start at one end. We cannot have the present structure and the present technology and at the same time achieve the environmental objectives. We must either change the structure or the technology or both. I think that the fairest thing from the point of view of the different transport sectors and also from the point of view of competition is for us to lead the way and introduce aircraft fuel tax within the EU. At the same time, however, we must pursue the line of revising the Chicago Convention of 1944 so that we establish a different system in the international area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When goods are traded electronically across borders, VAT is levied as a matter of course. When an item physically crosses the national border, unless that item can be transferred electronically, VAT is levied. The question arising here is whether VAT is levied when such items are the subject of a service which is provided electronically.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in these cases, we have many instances in which VAT is already levied. If the transaction takes place within the European Union between two Member States, VAT is levied. I am told that, when transactions are effected between states in the US, the applicable sales taxes are also levied in certain cases. The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU. There can be no doubt at all that this constitutes a distortion of competition, being detrimental both to retailers who, though they do not sell the same items, deal in similar products and to suppliers who offer the same sort of product from countries within the EU. Such distortion of competition cannot be tolerated in the long run, which is why I should like to say on behalf of my group that we endorse the proposals on this matter by the European Commission and by the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, it is only a question of finding a set of rules now so that these matters can be administered with as little red tape as possible. In this respect, the French proposal that registration be carried out in fifteen countries is surely not a suitable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on our agenda is the taxation of aviation fuel. Here too, I go along with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in principle. The taxation of aviation fuel is desirable for various reasons, but it is our firm belief that it can only be taxed on the basis of an international regime. If the European Union goes it alone, the result will be that flights from Frankfurt to the Costa del Sol, for example, will become considerably more expensive than flights from Frankfurt to Florida. That too is an unacceptable distortion of competition to the detriment of European operators. I therefore believe that efforts must be undertaken to create an international regime for the taxation of aviation fuel. My group and I take the view that unilateral European action would be unwise.</p>

Indeed, the position of fiscal sovereignty as symbol of national sovereignty seems to have been further strengthened by the introduction of the euro. Yet we are all aware now that unfettered fiscal competition is detrimental to every one of us. By offering short-term location incentives, a government damages the economies of neighbouring Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a European fiscal policy is not about levying Community taxes or harmonising tax regimes. It is about the coordination of taxes with a view to avoiding fiscal competition and establishing legal certainty, transparency and efficiency. This makes the siege mentality that prevailed in Nice all the more regrettable. EU fiscal policy remains governed by the consensus principle. This has to change if the single market is to function smoothly. We are already familiar with the problems in the domains of VAT and energy taxes. It will soon become apparent that the European capital market also requires coordination and harmonisation if the financial action plan is to stand even the slightest chance of being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the three proposals from the Commission and its communication. My group endorses the rapporteurs' conclusions. It is extremely regrettable that a framework directive on the taxation of energy products has not been adopted to this day. Perhaps, as a first step, agreement should be reached on a sort of code of conduct to encourage the use of fiscal instruments in the cause of energy saving and environmental protection. Positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be abolished. This, however, presupposes an international regime – and I entirely agree with the rapporteur here – otherwise it would unduly impair the competitiveness of the European airlines. Consequently, it would be very fitting indeed if the Commission were to present us with reports which included analyses of the relationship between taxation on the one hand and actual energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the period of applicability of the minimum standard rate, it is sadly obvious that we still await any sign of progress towards a definitive VAT system based on the country of origin, despite the euro having brought price transparency to the internal market. So we have no option but to welcome the Commission's attempt to introduce a wide range of new rules in order to improve the present system, which is too complex, bureaucratic, and open to evasion. Members of the European Parliament have never been able to understand why governments are prepared to go on tolerating the leakage of billions of euros in tax revenue under the current system. It is high time the Commission gathered the various VAT directives into a single regulation so that the VAT regime can at least be uniformly applied. That has to be said here. There is always a chance, of course, that we might yet receive a Christmas present.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the VAT arrangements applicable to certain services supplied by electronic means are concerned, the Commission proposal and the rapporteur merit our support. It is unacceptable that European companies should be at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-EU companies in the realm of e-commerce because they are liable for VAT in respect of their transactions in the world at large as well as those within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that e-commerce is not subject to heavier or lighter taxation than conventional business transactions. Registration in a single country is the appropriate, simple and efficient way to achieve this aim. However, on account of the wide range of VAT rates, it will be necessary, as our rapporteur rightly proposes, to distribute VAT revenue fairly among the Member States by means of a clearing system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was proposed at the Lisbon Summit last spring. It is both an excellent and necessary ambition. If, within the EU, we want to be competitive and stand on the front line, then this is a highly reasonable objective. Therefore, we Liberals share the Commission's ambitions, but we find it very hard to understand the specific proposals put forward by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to be the world's most dynamic continent and able to surpass the Americans when it comes to attracting the companies of the new economy, we need to provide good e-commerce opportunities. VAT-free e-commerce is what e-Europe needs – not bureaucracy and new taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the current rules, companies within the EU which sell music, computer games, software and services distributed electronically are taxed within the EU if these are bought by consumers within the EU. Companies from countries which are not members of the EU are not taxed at all. These rules lead to a distortion of competition which obviously needs to be remedied, but the Commission's proposal is a step in the wrong direction. Companies from countries outside the EU are forced to register a subsidiary company in at least one EU country to be able to carry on business within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes certain adjustments, as stated also by the rapporteur, but as we have heard, it shares the Commission's basic position. This is not a good solution for Europe. It is an old-fashioned way of thinking which does not fit in with the new economy. The proposal will put the EU behind in the game and would also be very difficult to control.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to give e-Europe a kick-start, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party proposes that the Commission's proposal be rejected and that the Member States be given the opportunity to introduce zero rate VAT on e-commerce. This zero rate VAT should apply until the VAT rules for non-electronic goods and services have been thoroughly examined and an agreement has been reached within OECD or another international forum on a common position on the taxation of e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let the experiences from the taxation package serve as an example. A global view is required. Many are in fact asking themselves, Commissioner, why Europeans are always so quick to introduce taxes and new rules? We do not need higher taxes in the EU, instead we need lower taxes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to understand why the Liberals want to do away with tax on e-commerce and to place a tax on the aviation fuel used in aircraft. I think it is important to establish some criteria. Aeroplanes are no less modern than e-commerce. Compact discs are not exactly antediluvian, and it would appear that these have to be taxed, whereas programmes circulating on the Internet are apparently to be exempt from tax.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to know, on the one hand, whether a very important aspect of economic activity assists the administration of public services and, from that point of view, taxation (like State funding) is absolutely unavoidable, and e-commerce cannot be exempt from this. On the other hand, taxation must be selected in such a way as to deter the consumer from choosing technologies which are the most harmful to the environment. That is the situation we are in at present, with the lack of a tax on aviation fuel scandalously boosting air travel at the expense of rail travel, even in circumstances in which, for other reasons such as noise and congestion, rail travel should be given preference in Europe. I am thinking in particular of the London-Paris-Amsterdam-Frankfurt quadrilateral.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the position adopted in Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s two reports, whereby both e-commerce and aviation fuel would be taxed, is excellent and we shall vote in favour of them. We would particularly congratulate the Commission for encouraging us to be bold when it comes to internal taxation of aviation. That being said, our collective view is that another tax should be contemplated, other than that relating to fuels, a tax affecting all airlines whenever their planes take off and land at European Union airports, so that we can circumvent international regulations and be in a position to tax our competitors too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Air traffic is increasing sharply. Even though the emissions from this source only represent a fairly small proportion of the total emissions of greenhouse gases, they are nevertheless increasing very fast. Finding a method for the taxation of aircraft fuel that works is therefore one of the key issues of climate policy. It would also create a much fairer situation between the different forms of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chicago Convention has become completely out-of-date on this point. We need international agreements on environment taxes, but not, however, the ban on environment taxes which the Convention involves. Therefore, point 16 of the report concerning the renegotiation of the Convention is particularly welcome. In anticipation of this, a system of environment taxes on aircraft within the EU would, of course, be a positive thing.

The goal which the Commission would like to achieve is to eliminate the disadvantage suffered by European e-businesses whose sales to European consumers are already subject to VAT. Nevertheless, the solution proposed will prove to be technically unmanageable and a barrier to the development of on-line transactions within the Union, at the very time when everybody is hoping for its expansion.</p>
<p class="contents">The point has been made from several quarters, even within the Council, which has decided to give itself more time, that the proposal is weak, that it leaves gaps and that it is such as to induce numerous objections. I will quote but a few: it appears that it would be impossible to apply the measures adopted without active cooperation from the other countries, particularly the United States, which is currently not at all disposed to cooperate. What would happen if an Eastern European country failed to register in Europe for VAT purposes? Would the site be blocked<span class="bold"> </span>or would we prosecute the users who continued to download files from offshore sites? When all is said and done, any benefit would go to the companies who, with relative ease and certain impunity, refused to comply with the registration obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">How can an e-business be certain that its clients have declared their true place of residence? If the European criteria of the registration obligation were to be taken up internationally for e-commerce taxation, the businesses complying with the obligation, including European businesses, would be forced to register in dozens and dozens of countries, incurring increasingly unreasonable expenses, especially where smaller firms are concerned. I could say more, for example on the decision to tax the sale of all electronic equipment etc. Moreover, this enthusiasm<span class="bold"> </span>for negligible amounts of taxable income and tax revenue is incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should rather endeavour to ensure that a common, definitive definition of the e-business taxation criteria reaches the OSCE or the WTO. For these reasons we will vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tax itself embodies many of the features of the European Union which makes it so unloved in my country: it is complicated, bureaucratic, difficult and expensive to administer and, in the UK at least, enforced by a draconian and unpopular inspectorate.</p>
<p class="contents">On Parliament's report, I find myself in complete disagreement with virtually every single word. I cannot, for instance, see why the introduction of the euro should require further or even any coordination of VAT rates. I do not see the introduction of a common system of VAT as a priority and I do not agree that the introduction of a common system is long overdue. In fact, nothing would please me, my party and the bulk of business people in the United Kingdom more than the complete abolition of VAT. We would prefer a simpler levy on retail goods. Moreover, we would prefer to determine our own taxes and reject the idea of a common tax system.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as to the Commission's proposal to extend the timescale the reform is introduced, I can only express my neutrality. But as to reducing that time, as the rapporteur proposed, I have to oppose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One reason for this is that the systems have become so complicated that even experts find them impossible to handle. There are too many individual taxes, and these taxes are excessively complex. Taxpayers feel they are being fleeced by the State; how are they supposed to understand their current tax liability when the system even baffles experts? Burdens which the public do not understand are automatically perceived to be unfair. Their logical response is to refuse to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">This refusal need not take the form of tax evasion. Very often a taxpayer will avoid taxation by doing less work, but there have also been cases of economic activities being relocated abroad. It surely cannot be our intention in adopting new taxes, so-called Euro-taxes, to accelerate this downward spiral in our countries. We have to appreciate that the people of Europe will not strive for greater economic success until hard work and efficiency are properly rewarded again in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are familiar with the vital statistics: with taxes and public charges accounting for more than 45% of earned income, many of our Member States have budget deficits, whereas the United States, where taxes and public charges account for less than 30% of earned income, is achieving budget surpluses of several hundred billion dollars. We must aim to streamline and simplify our tax systems and to reduce the rate of taxation, not increase it. The taxation of aircraft fuel must therefore be rejected. The sixth VAT directive must be simplified; if any limit is to be imposed at all on VAT rates, it should be an upper limit and certainly not a prescribed minimum. This means that zero-rating of VAT must be permissible for the provision of electronic services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I applaud Mr García-Margallo's heroic efforts on aircraft fuel, I am afraid I cannot agree with his stance on VAT in e-commerce because I think that the Commission's proposal sends out the wrong signal. We should be thinking out ways to encourage e-commerce and not thinking up new ways in which to tax it. The de facto tax-free status of much US e-commerce must have had a tremendous impact in encouraging the new economy and its phenomenal success in the US. This tax is unenforceable, why should we spend the time and the money and the effort on creating a tax that we cannot collect.</p>
<p class="contents">The very day a respectable dot.com starts levying VAT, a less respectable dot.com will set up selling exactly the same products without VAT and that is where the customers will go. The proposal is arguably inconsistent with the Ottawa Accord because it provides for different rates for on-line and off-line equivalent products such as, for example, newspapers which would enjoy a reduced rate in their off-line physical form. It will be almost impossible for e-businesses to work out the VAT status of their customers and impossible to work out whether their customers are based in the EU, whether they are businesses or not. And as we move ever closer towards electronic money, even the comfort of a credit card billing address will no longer be available to e-businesses as they try to ascertain whether they should charge VAT to a particular customer or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of revenue about which we are talking is very small at the moment. There is no need to rush into this legislation. We are talking about the future of Europe's economy, the future of its e-economy, let us take the time to get this proposal right. I would call upon the Commission to rethink the proposal and to think of an alternative way. The preferable option by far is to zero rate European e-businesses to put them on the same playing-field as American and other businesses around the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, this discussion gives me the opportunity to sum up my own position on the issue of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to levy taxes and other charges is one of the foundations of any organised society. Without taxes, there is no State. It is no surprise that the Nice Summit has confirmed the principle of unanimity where all decisions about tax are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Edinburgh Summit had limited contributions to the Community budget to 1.27% of European gross domestic product. The European Union’s budget for next year will be closer to 1% than to this upper limit. That is very little indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">All States redistribute at least 30%, often 40% and occasionally more than 50% of their national wealth created during the year. No one can define the optimum level of compulsory levies.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals tell us that as little State involvement as possible is required. The United States are cited as an example of a country which adopts this policy. The US Federal budget redistributes only a third of American GDP. In Europe, compulsory levies include large transfers to finance pensions and health care. In the United States, however, social protection is largely the province of the private sector. Free-market health care therefore costs the Americans the equivalent of 14% of their GDP, compared with 8 to 9% in European countries. Ought not these health care costs in the United States to be added on if tax levels on each side of the Atlantic are to be compared?</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the answer, the point of this digression is to note that solidarity organised via the American budget is thirty times greater than that organised via the Community budget. Unless there is broad Community solidarity of a kind which is only possible on the basis of a federal structure that is unlikely to exist in the foreseeable future, the individual States of the European Union will be forced to retain control of their taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">In acknowledging this state of affairs, the European Union will nonetheless have to, and be able to, fulfil its duty to coordinate taxation in Europe. Coordinating and harmonising are not the same as standardising. Fiscal competition is in the interests of the people and of the economy. The United States and the Swiss Confederation have internal markets in which tax varies greatly between one state, or canton, and another. American local sales tax<span class="italic"> </span>may vary between zero and ten points, although the difference between neighbouring states is generally no more than five points. This clearly demonstrates that Europe has no need of uniform VAT rates. Minimum rates, and possibly a maximum rate, are needed, but the States need to be allowed room for manoeuvre to enable them to pursue their own microeconomic policies. Obviously, any unfair tax competition needs to be combated, especially when it comes to business tax matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Primarolo group has devised simple rules which must be applied. Money laundering must be combated, as must organised crime and tax fraud. That is already happening, even in States which practice banking secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of common rules and minimum tax thresholds. Levying tax at source on savings products is acceptable, on condition that they are reasonable and levied at source. Many Europeans have difficulty accepting tax on savings because they feel they are being taxed twice over. Those who spend their income pay VAT. Those who save the yield from their income which has already been taxed ought, on Ecofin’s reasoning, to be subject to a levy at source and will, in addition, be taxed on an assessment basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call for uniform taxation at source. This could be allocated as a direct resource to the Community budget. National contributions to the European Union’s budget should be reduced by the same amount. A procedure like that would eliminate the need for the European bureaucratic information exchange system thought up in Feira. There is also a danger of the latter system leading to the complete renationalisation of European taxation, because each State will be able, in 2010, to establish its national tax as it sees fit. Other States will simply be induced to supply the information needed for the purposes of national taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, Feira does not constitute progress but, rather, a setback when it comes to necessary tax coordination in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, in order to ensure that operators from outside the Union are subject to the same tax obligations as domestic operators when providing services to consumers, they must be registered for VAT purposes in a Member State of their choice, with the VAT rate of the State they choose being the one that applies to their operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We debated this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and some committee members spoke in favour of tax exemption for this type of service, arguing that this would eliminate the competitive disadvantage. I believe that this argument is mistaken. It is an inappropriate argument and it is not in accordance with European legislation, and furthermore it would do comparative harm to services provided by other means. Furthermore, it is not true that a moratorium on the taxation of electronic services has been introduced in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the Commission’s proposal in its entirety and the excellent work of Mr García-Margallo y Marfil. I personally tabled an amendment on the harmonisation of VAT rates, which would correct the effects of unfair competition resulting from third country operators’ power to choose when it comes to registering, since there is a very broad range of VAT rates available to them – between 15 and 25% – while domestic operators have no choice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that a better solution has been found to compensate the Member States for the loss of VAT income resulting from these differences in rates, a solution which I consider to be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of an objection, the Group that I represent in this House believes that we should correct the fact that, while newspapers normally enjoy reduced VAT rates, this reduction is not applicable to electronic newspapers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is absolutely no justification for imposing high taxes on all fuels except kerosene at a time when the volume of air traffic is rising sharply in terms of both cargo and passenger miles. This has been accompanied by a correspondingly sharp increase in emissions of greenhouse gases and noise levels. Fuel taxation serves several purposes. On the one hand, excise duties on fuel, like all taxes, help to finance national budgets. On the other hand, they also have a regulatory function in that they reduce fuel consumption and hence the depletion of carbonised energy resources and the emission of greenhouse gases. </p>
<p class="contents">These taxes therefore confront industry with a constant challenge to manufacture vehicles with lower fuel consumption. That is precisely what we want to see for aircraft too. So why should aircraft fuel not be taxed now, at long last? We are, after all, anxious to ensure that no mode of transport is treated unfairly. But the situation is not quite as straightforward as that. Air traffic covers greater distances than any other mode of transport. More significantly, aircraft fly across borders, including the borders of the European Union. Even now, without kerosene duty, the airports in the EU are locked in fierce competition. The main reason for this is the fact that different regions have different rules for night flying, a situation which affects cargo transport in particular. This puts enormous pressure on airlines to keep their prices down. If we were now to go it alone in Europe and tax aircraft fuel, European operators would scarcely be able to compete with airlines based outside Europe. We would destroy our own European market. So the taxation of kerosene is only possible on the basis of an international consensus if a level playing-field is to be guaranteed. This is what Europe must work towards, even though it will be a long and arduous process. Until this goal is achieved, there are certainly other means of regulating air traffic, such as emission-based take-off and landing fees at all European airports. That option would affect all airlines, European and non-European. It would not distort competition in any way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the comments I have heard around the floor today would almost suggest that we do not need this kind of report, but of course we do. It is tempting for us always to compare ourselves with the USA and to say that because they cannot find a satisfactory solution, we should not either. But the fact is that VAT on goods and services applies across the European Union. This is a tax which already exists. It is not a new tax and it should be applied. It should be applied to the Internet at well. Otherwise, what would happen? Well of course the issue of unfair competition has already been mentioned. Why should the retail industry be so badly affected and be made to suffer in order for another industry to grow? If indeed it can be affected that way by what the proposal suggests, and I doubt that.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this proposal is in line, as I see it, with the principles agreed at Ecofin, which in turn are in line with the agreed principles of the OECD Conference in Ottawa. The source where the tax should apply is a matter of concern, and the discussion around the number of countries which would qualify to have companies registered in them is something which I believe will be burdensome and of course provoke the USA to a complaint in the WTO. But I do not believe that e-commerce is going to be crushed by VAT being suddenly applied like some evil giant. I think that the real problem is that EU retail industries will continue to suffer the disadvantages that they are currently suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">It is amusing to hear some of the comments being made around this Chamber today but it is quite clearly also amusing to remember that the kind of cashless society that perhaps the likes of Trotters Independent Trading Company in the UK were involved in is the kind of society that is being advocated by some over on the other side of the House. Are we going to end up with that kind of cashless society, with cowboy e-commerce outfits being able to do what they want? I do not think so. That is not how we are meant to organise society, and that is why I think this proposal is an excellent one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that I made in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism which this Parliament voted on a few months ago, namely, that since it is undoubtedly politically difficult to achieve international agreement on an aviation tax, at least in a short term, we should look at alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including an emissions charge. Such a charge could be levied on all flights coming into or going out of EU airports, on all carriers, and plenty of research has been done to show that this would not have negative competitive effects. It could be agreed very swiftly without requiring international consensus, and could help make significant progress towards internalising environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of moving ahead on this issue swiftly is very clear. The forecasts for the global growth of aviation are terrifying. Official figures suggest a doubling of passenger numbers in just fifteen or twenty years, and if you look at what that means in UK terms alone, in order to meet that scale of demand we would be needing an extra four new Heathrow Airports or an extra eight new Gatwick Airports. That would clearly be both politically and environmentally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">So, instead of trying to meet projected demand we need to try to manage and reduce that demand by ensuring that the price of aviation more accurately reflects its environmental cost. When air tickets are 42% cheaper today than they were ten years ago, it is clear that the wrong price signals are being given out. It makes no sense at all that I can travel from London to Brussels return for just £89 by Virgin Airways, for example, yet when I use Eurostar, which produces far fewer greenhouse gases and is a much more pleasant way to travel, I have to pay the equivalent of around £250 for a similar journey.</p>
<p class="contents">So to conclude, action in this area is overdue and if we do not do something about it very swiftly then our efforts to try to reduce the impacts of climate change are going to be stymied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst there is recognition in this report that a kerosene tax cannot be imposed internationally due to the exemption in the Chicago Convention, nevertheless the introduction of such a tax, intra-EU or bilaterally, would be severely damaging to the United Kingdom and the entire European aviation industry. Not only would our air fares increase dramatically – possibly by £80 per ticket, thereby threatening the very existence of the smaller carriers – but the damage would also affect the aerospace manufacturers, tourism, businesses and, of course, the freight carriers – they now carry a third of freight world-wide by air.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true to say that aviation does not bear its costs. In fact, the industry pays 100% of its infrastructure costs through air traffic control and airport charges, amounting to US $4bn in 1998 – unlike other modes of transport, such as rail and road, which are still heavily subsidised. These facts must be recognised. In addition, to impose this tax would bring little benefit to the environment, as was proven by the introduction of the air passenger duty tax in the United Kingdom. Aviation is in fact responsible for 2.5% of CO2 emissions world wide. Other approaches, such as trading and offsets, could be more environmentally-friendly and cost- effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, such measures would ruin the competitiveness of the European industry <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the rest of the world and would also cause massive job losses. So I, for one, will continue to speak up for an industry which is often singled out as the big bad wolf. This report is badly crafted on the part of the Commission and this Parliament. The public at large deserves better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are those who reject any form of taxation, including tax on e-commerce. There are those who, rather than trying to resolve a question at European level, imagine that it is always better to refer it to other fora so as not to resolve it. I am thinking in particular of Mr Dell'Alba’s intervention. There are those, like Mr Titford, who vigorously defend their own national interest, preferring tax competition to European coordination. I am not among these. Like Mr Skinner, I think that the proposals from the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, regarding VAT on e-commerce are good. We do, in fact, think that we must review our tax system in the light of technological developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is an unfavourable one. The facts are that, today, a French person can purchase software from an American company exempt from VAT, whereas an American making a similar acquisition from a French company is taxed at the rate current in France. I see this as a double competitive advantage for the American company. I am not sure that this is the best way of supporting our own e-commerce industry. Now, it seems that very many voices, in this Chamber too, have been raised in support of this industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We think this distortion of competition between Member States and third countries is unacceptable. The Commission’s proposals would permit progress towards greater coordination, and they are along the right lines. Then, there is the argument according to which a sector should be exempt from tax on the grounds that it is experiencing rapid growth. That is not my view. Finally, the French Presidency’s proposals were discussed, according to which tax should be levied at the point of consumption, with a requirement for service providers to be registered in all the Member States. Our rapporteur’s proposal echoes those of the Commission, favouring one-off registration in a single Member State. If this can provide the basis for a compromise, it will probably be a good compromise as long as it is not used to reintroduce distortion of competition due to the different VAT rates applicable in our various Member States. The equalisation mechanism proposed by our rapporteur is along these lines. That is why, together with the other members of my group, I shall support the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only intend to speak about the taxation of aviation fuel. Parallel to this debate, we have been holding talks with Mr Currie, the Director-General for Environmental Affairs, on the outcome of the negotiations in The Hague. In this context, I am sorry to say that aircraft emissions do pose a problem; although air traffic is not responsible for a large percentage of pollutant emissions, its volume is growing very rapidly, and we must therefore avoid any temptation to trivialise it.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must also reach an agreement, because there are widely differing views here in the House about the method we should use to tackle this problem. I believe we all agree that it would be very difficult indeed to find a global solution but that a global solution represents the ideal outcome. There are now some – and they include a majority of the committee – who say they want a European tax, to which the rapporteur has rightly replied that such a tax could only cover a tiny percentage of the world's air traffic and, more crucially, that it would create a huge problem for European industry. This, I believe, gives us good reason to be sceptical about this solution, although views vary, even within the PPE-DE Group. I know that my own party at home would support the principle of a European tax, but I believe the time has come for us to make a real concerted effort to identify common ground and to seek the solution that has the greatest possible beneficial impact on the environment coupled with the least possible distortion of competition for European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, the proposal for emission-based take-off and landing fees ought to be seriously examined, because it offers a means of including aircraft from other parts of the world, such as the United States and Japan, in the taxation regime when they land in Amsterdam, London, Paris or Frankfurt and thus of achieving greater environmental benefit and less distortion of competition. There might be problems with the WTO, but I believe it is up to the Commission to seek a solution at the WTO negotiations, a solution which is compatible with the WTO rules and which our trading partners might be persuaded to accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European aircraft carriers would be disadvantaged compared to carriers from third countries and it would distort intra-EU as opposed to intercontinental fare structures.</p>
<p class="contents">While the expansion of air traffic and the environmental problems of global warming and pollution are serious and important issues, I feel that a more effective approach would be to tackle this within an international framework. By focusing our attention too narrowly on only the activities which take place within the EU, we risk harming our industry without achieving much-needed progress in lowering emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">This same problem of trying to impose a regional solution to a global question arises with the difficult issue of VAT on digital electronic services. To levy VAT on third-country suppliers, largely American, is not only impractical but, in the case of newspapers and books, it gives rise to inconsistencies between the same products sold on line as opposed to in a shop. It is also inherently neither enforceable nor collectable, unless regulated internationally, as undoubtedly servers would be set up offshore beyond the EU's jurisdiction. The scheme will be harmful to the development of SMEs, both within and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold to a prohibitively low level of EUR 40 000 annual turnover. I personally advocate a VAT zero rating of all digital services until international agreement is finally reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Torres Marques report on a minimum standard rate for VAT represents tax harmonisation by the back door and threatens the UK's zero rates on children's clothes, food and newspapers. As a British Conservative, I can only regret the high indirect tax rates throughout the European Union and I hope that by promoting tax competition we may bring pressure on our Labour Government to lower them in the United Kingdom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like him, I am unable to join in the euphoria and applause that greeted it in many quarters. I should just like to address two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that we in Austria have had very gratifying experience of taxation at source in connection with capital-gains tax. It creates legal certainty for every individual saver and citizen. It seems to me, however, that a solution which will avoid a flight of capital from Europe is only achievable within the OECD framework and not through a collection of individually negotiated bilateral arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to deal briefly with the proposals on services provided by electronic means, which primarily relate, of course, to services downloaded from the Internet and to radio and television services. I believe we must ensure that no competitive disadvantages are incurred within Europe. Despite my fundamentally favourable response to the Commission proposal, I have to say that it seems premature and, in parts, underdeveloped, if one considers the many questions it leaves unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I very much doubt whether the present text will be able to find general acceptance. To my mind, it would be wiser to aim for a VAT regime in the OECD framework, even though in all probability it would only take the form of a code of conduct at that level.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point is that the EU should not legislate in haste and should make every effort to strengthen e-commerce and to avoid undermining it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We who make the policy decisions in the EU must not, through our own actions, weaken European competitiveness. As, for example, Mr Schmidt said in his speech, we must comply with what was agreed at Lisbon and do all we can to strengthen the dynamism of the European Union. If we are too greedy in this matter now under discussion we will really be jeopardising the future of e-business, which is so important for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I agree with the Commission’s proposal and with all my colleagues who have spoken here today that the distortion of competition that now exists in the market must be eliminated as soon as possible. This distortion can be eliminated in two ways: either by imposing the same tax obligations on companies that come from third countries as on their European counterparts, or by also exempting European companies working in this field, which is just being developed, from VAT. When we also consider the unsolved problems referred to by many others with regard to the aforementioned Commission proposal, as a result, for example, of monitoring the system, verifying where the assessment of taxes took place, distributing tax revenues fairly, and other factors, I am convinced that, at this stage, it would be more reasonable to adopt the line the minority were in favour of in the committee discussion. I therefore support those who want to totally exempt European companies from tax on electronic products, for the present at least.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do I really understand the argument that products that are supplied electronically should be treated in just the same way as traditional products. Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example, said this. In my opinion, reading the morning paper in a street café is quite different from reading it on the Internet where you work. We are talking about a different product. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic has been given much attention ever since the Commission introduced the proposal on 7 June of this year. I am aware that some Members have been swamped with opposing views. Since the introduction, Parliament and the Council have shifted a lot of work. Although I am convinced that the Commission proposal, which is still before us, forms a sound point of departure, I have also noticed that Parliament and the Council are helping along the thought process in a constructive manner. This forms a sound basis for further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for his contribution and for the positive ideas which were put forward in his report. The Council’s Working Party on Financial Questions also pored over the topic of VAT and e-commerce. The outcome of that consultation was discussed within Ecofin at the end of November. I think that the conclusions of those ministers constitute a step in the right direction. The Council has reached agreement on the following key areas: electronic services must be taxed in the Community if use is made of these within the Community. They are not taxed in the Community if they are used outside of its borders. The guiding principle that suppliers from outside the Community who supply to customers within the Community need only register at one location must not lead to a shift in tax revenue between the Member States. Measures should be taken to avoid this. There is general consensus that a solution must be found whereby suppliers from outside the Community need only register at one location, and this is an absolute necessity in the eyes of the Commission. I would like to briefly comment on the further detailing of this solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s idea to develop a mechanism to avoid distortions emanating from differences in rates meets with the support of a majority of the Member States. I am of the opinion that this idea can be combined with the original Commission proposal for one single registration without putting up bureaucratic barriers for industry. I would like to stress that we are talking about a system of reallocation of revenue and not about the distribution of this revenue. The system of reallocation of revenue will need to be carefully worked out. It is useful to have an objective and clear criterion at our disposal, namely the Member State where the consumer lives. This rules out the complexities which would emerge if macroeconomic or similar criteria were to be applied. Although I do not foresee any insurmountable technical hitches, a great deal of time will need to be invested in the next couple of months in the further development of the system, particularly with respect to the legal basis, so as to enable tax to be levied on all Member States by means of one declaration. As usual, we need to ensure that the solution we opt for does not give cause for concern outside the Community with regard to discrimination against suppliers who are not based in the Community. In this context, I believe that the Council should revisit the issue of threshold amounts for registration and look at whether a fair solution can be found. All in all, a number of details still need to be looked at. I am of the opinion that considerable headway has been made under the French Presidency, and I am convinced that in 2001, Sweden will continue in the same vein.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the debate in the Council is still under way and also given the Commission’s wish to bring the topic of VAT and e-commerce to a successful conclusion in the short term, I am of the opinion that at this moment in time, it would be desirable not to accept Parliament’s amendment proposals formally but to try to incorporate these proposals as far as possible in the negotiations with the Council. However, I do not share Parliament’s ideas on one aspect, namely the introduction of a reduced rate or even a zero rate for electronic services, an idea which was, in fact, floated by various Members this afternoon too.</p>
<p class="contents">VAT is a general consumer tax. There are few exemptions from VAT and where these have been introduced, this was generally for cultural or social reasons. Electronic services cannot be brought under this heading and it is unacceptable to stimulate part of industry. The intention of my proposal is to iron out any existing inequalities and to create equal conditions for European and non-European companies. I would like to emphasise that, apart from the difference in insight to which I referred a moment ago, there is far-reaching agreement between Parliament’s and the Council’s approaches and in particular, about registration, threshold amounts and reallocation of revenue, and that in further talks in the Council, the points which Parliament has brought forward will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also prepared, in principle, to accept Parliament’s amendment proposal on administrative cooperation. This is a simplification measure which regulates the exchange of information between the Member States on VAT numbers in the electronic trade, and we will take the proposal to heart in our future work in Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to turn to the proposal on the minimum level of the normal rate. Despite the efforts made by this Parliament and the Commission, as referred to by the rapporteur in his report, little progress has been made so far on the activities to replace the present VAT transitional regulation by a final regulation based on tax in the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it should also be pointed out that the current climate, where the conditions are not favourable for achieving further harmonisation of VAT rates in the short term, makes meaningful progress in the near future very unlikely. Consequently, without prejudicing the idea of a definitive system but with a view to improving the working of the internal market in the short term, the Commission has drawn up a new VAT strategy which comprises four key goals, namely the simplification and modernisation of the existing rules, more uniform application of the present provisions and stricter implementation of administrative cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the light of this that this proposal is seeking to maintain the existing level of harmonisation in the field of VAT rates by confirming the minimum level of 15% for the normal rate. The proposed five-year period reflects the stability which the new VAT strategy stands for, and reducing this period to three years, as proposed by the rapporteur, seems too short to enable the Commission to meet its obligations. This is why I cannot accept the proposed amendments. Should the circumstances take a dramatic and unpredictable turn within the next couple of years, the Commission can always consider submitting a fresh proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on the report on tax on aircraft fuel. The Commission’s communication regarding tax on aircraft fuel accommodated the request which the Council made in its resolution of 9 June 1997. In it, the Council asked the Commission to provide more detailed information on all aspects of the introduction of such tax and especially on the environmental effects, the competitive position and profitability of the aviation industry within the European Union compared to its competitors outside of the Union, and the possibility of applying other instruments which have similar effects.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication took into account the conclusions of an exhaustive study. The upshot of this study was that the environmental effects and the implications for tax revenue and other effects mainly depend on two factors, namely the level and scope of the tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that Mr García-Margallo’s report by and large supports the conclusions reached by the Commission. The suggestion to extend the scope of excise on mineral oils to include aircraft fuel and thus to end the existing inequality in treatment with regard to different modes of transport has met with strong support. Furthermore, this approach was generally well-received during the discussions which were held within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation that future discussions must take place within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the ICAO, namely during its 33rd general meeting in September and October of the year 2001, also met with the same level of support. These discussions will prove very difficult, however, since the possibility of levying tax on aircraft fuel was not decided on at the previous general meeting. Accordingly, no major groundwork has been done within the ICAO working parties and it is unlikely that the Chicago Convention will be re-negotiated at the forthcoming general meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the Community could urgently request the review of the existing ICAO provisions concerning tax on aircraft fuel to be included in the working programme of that organisation and to underline the anticipated positive environmental effects of such a measure <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> other ICAO members.</p>
<p class="contents">A resolution issued by the general meeting of the ICAO which paves the way for an internal solution to the issue of tax on aircraft fuel or the use of other instruments with equivalent effects would be a crucial first step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have noticed that the European Parliament would like to go further than the Commission where the Commission’s opinion is concerned. According to that view, at this moment in time it would be neither viable nor desirable to introduce a tax on aircraft fuel only on flights within the Community carried out by Community aviation companies, for reasons which have been given an ample airing in this House this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is of the opinion that in a fast growing sector, such as the aviation sector, the environmental effects of relatively unimportant measures can never be considered insignificant. I would, however, like to point out that current Community tax legislation does not allow for only national and intra-Community flights to be taxed. This would become possible after the Council has approved the Commission’s proposal on the restructuring of tax on energy products, which has been before the Council for discussion since March 1997, and concerning which this House is aware that approval is still pending. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
