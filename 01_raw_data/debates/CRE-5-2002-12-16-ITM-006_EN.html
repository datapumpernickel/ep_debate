<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Schengen Information System (SIS) is a system of computer networks on which the information provided by the Schengen States is stored and consulted by the police and customs authorities of other Schengen States. The SIS is the largest database in Europe and has a dual function: firstly to maintain public order and security and, secondly, to deal with immigration, providing support for measures intended to compensate for the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, two Spanish initiatives were submitted to us in the aim of giving the SIS new functions, primarily for combating terrorism. I must express my regret that this report, for internal European Parliament reasons, confines itself to these two Spanish initiatives and does not also cover, as initially intended, a resolution on the Commission communication on the development of the future SIS-II, which contains proposals to increase the system’s capacity, and to introduce new technical and research possibilities. I am sorry, in particular, because the two Spanish initiatives seek to include improvements in the current version of the SIS that must necessarily reflect the long-term aims of SIS-II and, consequently, must be considered to be an integral part of the process of transition from SIS-I to SIS-II.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made a thorough study of the Spanish initiatives, we have reached the conclusion that, although we are unable to subscribe to them fully, they can be accepted if some amendments are made to them that are basically designed to ensure that guarantees of the protection of citizens’ rights are not called into question, thereby responding to the European Parliament’s main concern throughout this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Some proposals contained in the Spanish initiatives are acceptable, such as access by Europol or by Eurojust, provided that appropriate guarantees are put in place to ensure the legitimacy and the legality of any use of data. This being the case, the conditions laid down in Amendments No 7, concerning Europol and No 10, which I tabled, concerning Eurojust, must be met before access can be granted. If this access for new users is made possible, the purpose for which it is granted must always be respected, limiting this access to information which they have the right to access and ensuring that at least the same if not a greater level of protection of our citizens’ rights is in place. It is also important that Europol and Eurojust’s needs to access the SIS data are more rigorously examined and justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for the full recording of searches are to be welcomed, but it seems appropriate to specify in the Article what information must be recorded. A legal basis must also be provided for the operation of the Sirene offices, an idea that I had already suggested in my report of June 2001, and which forces these offices to remove data whenever this proves necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, these two initiatives contain other proposals that, in our opinion, must await the development of SIS-II, when appropriate guarantees are put in place. This applies to the proposal to extend access to data on missing, stolen or lost identity documents. Although I have no objections in principle, I feel that, in the absence of additional measures to protect the rights of persons whose documents have been stolen, whose identity is used illegally or those whose data are simply input incorrectly into the SIS, the European Parliament cannot, at this stage, approve this proposal, which is likely to aggravate the problems of citizens whose identity has been usurped. The same applies to the proposal to add additional data on wanted persons and to incorporate identification material in alerts on persons, notably photographs and fingerprints, on which adequate guarantees must first be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has commissioned a feasibility study to be undertaken on the development of SIS-II, which should be available in March 2003. I hope that the European Parliament will then have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on these conclusions. I wish once again to express my unhappiness at the fact that this feasibility study will not be looking into the possibility of combining the Schengen, Europol, customs and possibly Eurojust databases into one database, in the aim of eliminating duplication, streamlining resources and improving accuracy; a common database that would be made available to different users in a different way, guaranteeing restricted and specific access to the various areas of the database.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that there is already political agreement on the need to create a new SIS – this is a Council decision with a legal basis for the development of SIS-II, and with the necessary budget. The way in which this will be managed will be determined in a future document. I wish to recall that this has been the clear position of this Parliament: this management must be undertaken by the Commission and must be subject to parliamentary and judicial control. It is to be hoped that SIS-II will be developed by 2006. Given the danger of this development taking longer than planned, however, I think it is acceptable and appropriate for us to be making some improvements – at least those that are possible at this stage – to the SIS in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I wish to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose amendments have contributed to improving this report. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and, particularly, the socialist shadow rapporteur, Sérgio Sousa Pinto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, I can even add that some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur are already included in the texts of the Council working group studying these initiatives. The draft initiatives in question will be discussed for the first time at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19 December, in the Joint Committee with Iceland and Norway, and the Commission is willing to support several of the concerns expressed by the rapporteur and which, I am sure, Parliament’s plenary will support.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I agree with the opinion on the need to limit Europol’s access to the categories of data recorded under Articles 95, 99 and 100 of the Schengen Convention and to ensure that the data in question will be neither copied nor downloaded. This access must not transform the SIS into a research tool and nor must it be in any way disproportionate to the reasons for such access being granted. In my opinion, this type of access can be particularly useful in giving Europol the opportunity to request additional information from the Member States in specific cases they are investigating, in the context of the fight against terrorism, for example. This is, as a matter of fact, the type of information that Europol is already authorised to request and obtain directly from Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to data protection, the Commission believes that the new provisions concerning the SIS, which falls partially within the sphere of Community competence, particularly with regard to Article 96, must be studied in light of their compatibility not only with the Council of Europe’s 1981 Convention on data protection, but also with the content of Directive 45/96/EC. Similarly, the study of the proportionality of certain measures can be facilitated through consultation with the competent authorities, whether they are acting under the third or the first pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we particularly appreciate the opinion of the Joint Supervisory Authority on these draft initiatives, with which we largely agree, including the reference to the fact that extended access must be granted to the authorities responsible for issuing residence permits, to the data of Article 100 of the security information system where identity documents are concerned; safeguards must be in place, however, to ensure that such access will not infringe the rights of citizens whose identity documents have been stolen. I believe that this matter, raised by the rapporteur and which is extremely significant, cannot be resolved solely by developing new technical solutions or by introducing new functions, as Mr Coelho said, for SIS-II, which, in principle, will become operational in 2006. This matter must be addressed now and must above all be accompanied by the necessary information to the citizens about the existence of the Schengen Information System and on the conditions governing its use, including the need to delete some details in the event that documents are stolen or lost.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Schengen Information System-II, as the rapporteur said, the Commission was given the task of developing the new generation SIS in January 2002 and we anticipated a global approach to its functions in the communication that we presented to the Council and to Parliament on 18 December 2001. To put it succinctly, I should like to say to the House that the timetable for the preparation of SIS-II has so far been met and that the feasibility study is due to be concluded in March 2003. This will enable us better to help candidate countries prepare for the future elimination of internal borders, which can only take place when SIS-II becomes operational. A report by the Commission services is now being finalised, describing in detail the current state of play of this study, which will be conveyed to the European Parliament and to the Council at the beginning of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europol and Eurojust are now at last to be given the right to access the Schengen Information System, something that in the light of new threats from organised criminality and terrorism is also an urgent necessity. It is also a real step forward that invitations to tender can be collated. In his report, Mr Coelho addresses the issues and problems relating to data protection and puts forward well-reasoned proposals for resolving them. His report therefore deserves wholehearted support.</p>
<p class="contents">As this House's former rapporteur on the development of the second-generation Schengen Information System, I would like to take this opportunity to again urge the Commission and the Council to act with speed. Mr Coelho himself has already pointed out that access will be able to be extended to certain persons or bodies only in conjunction with this new generation. This development must be complete by 2006 at the latest, and even that is actually two years too late, because, as we all know, the eastward enlargement is to be accomplished in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, though, have to think further ahead. There are indications that the Convention will dispense with the existing three-pillar model of the European Union, and I say that it is right to do so, as it was the intergovernmental ‘justice and home affairs’ pillar that originally caused the data protection problem that we are discussing. The application of fifteen different sets of national data protection rules within Europol and Eurojust is even now leading to chaos. In addition, a lack of parliamentary and judicial oversight has resulted in a democratic deficit such as would make Montesquieu turn in his grave. The Convention's Working Party X has now, quite rightly, proposed that Europol be incorporated into the Community sphere, but, Commissioner Vitorino, that will not be enough. What is needed is the complete incorporation of the Schengen Agreement as well as of Europol and Eurojust into the Community sphere, and the establishment of what one might call 'Eurobord', an additional coordinating body for the external borders. Under this one roof we need a unitary system, combining the Schengen Information System, the customs information system and the Europol database, that is subject to European data protection and monitored by a European Data Protection Commissioner, by Parliament and by the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something to the left-wingers in this House. I see that Mr Krarup is here. Mr Krarup, you are opposed to the Schengen Information System and would like to see it abolished. This is all I have to say to that: anyone who concerns himself with the fate of refugees and stands up for them, whilst at the same time ignoring the fact that there are also criminals and lawbreakers outside Europe, has the misfortune to live in a dream world and takes an irresponsible, not to say unscrupulous attitude towards our people. You will not get a majority in this House!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Coelho's report, which we are adopting today, is a step in the right direction, but it is the Convention that will have to make the great leaps. For that, Commissioner, we wish you every success and perhaps a little more courage than you have hitherto demonstrated! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sousa Pinto (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Coelho, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work. The report makes a balanced evaluation of the two Spanish initiatives on giving new functions to the Schengen Information System, which is especially important in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Council, together with the Commission, drafted a package of measures intended to increase the level of security in Europe and to ensure the highest degree of effectiveness in combating terrorism. Some of these measures have a direct effect on the Schengen Information System. Since SIS-II will only be operational in 2006, improving the current system is an urgent need that must be seen as part of the process of transition to the new system.</p>
<p class="contents">These new functions will, of course, have to be adopted in total compliance with our citizens’ individual rights, freedoms and guarantees, with strict control of the use of personal data available in the SIS. We all understand the need to have efficient information systems, which are equal to the task of the challenges we face from international crime, but we can never use this as an excuse for disrespecting or ignoring the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded as a Community governed by the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore attempting to amend certain Articles of the Schengen Convention in the aim of giving it new functions. Giving Europol and the national members of Eurojust the opportunity to access certain data in the SIS is one of the most important practical proposals of this initiative. The need to improve cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs and, in particular, the linking and crosschecking of information from databases, is one of the aims that the European Union and the Member States must pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, the fact that the SIS was created to support the Member States in areas involving public order and domestic security, areas that are covered by the action of Europol and Eurojust, leads us to approve the principle of exchanging information underlying the proposal contained in the Spanish initiative. Nevertheless, as emphasised by the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority, the body responsible for monitoring the SIS, access to the database by Europol and the national members of Eurojust raises doubts in terms of data protection and can only become a reality if the basic principle of the legitimacy and legality of access to the database and its use is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context of having some reservations about the initial Spanish proposals, we welcome the rapporteur’s introduction of amendments that we believe respond to the concerns expressed by the Joint Supervisory Authority and by various members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. The European Police Service will therefore have the right to consult and study SIS data only for the purposes for which these data were provided. As to access by the national members of Eurojust, these will have the right to consult SIS data only if this right is compatible with the purposes for which the data were provided. National members of Eurojust will have to record all searches they undertake and will not be able to supply data to third countries or to other bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Other proposals contained in the initiative were rejected, in my opinion rightly so, by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms at the proposal of the rapporteur, because they did not provide sufficient guarantees, and it would therefore be preferable to continue to await SIS-II. This applies primarily to the proposal seeking to give the bodies responsible for issuing and studying permits the opportunity to access the data contained in the SIS. For the reasons I have given, the report Carlos Coelho has presented deserves the applause and the support of the Socialist Group.</p>

I merely need to quote the name, beginning with a ‘B’, of a future President of the European Council who is to take office in just over six months’ time. There is of course a type of criminal beside whom the small fry we have outside the EU pale into insignificance. That was an aside. My main criticism and my attitude to the proposals before us are expressed in a minority opinion on the report. They are based on the wonder I have always felt at the European Union’s and its institutions’ ability to empty the language of meaning and, in certain cases, to make the language mean the opposite of what was intended. Opposition to the proposals before us is based on the fact that surveillance technology is being reinforced but that insufficient attention is being given to the rule of law, in spite of protests to the contrary. I merely need to cite an example in the form of Article 101a of the proposal concerning Europol’s access to the Schengen Information System. A number of basic requirements are made of Europol, but there is no reasonable guarantee whatsoever that Europol will comply with those requirements. There is the supervisory body provided for by Article 24 of the Europol Convention, but all that may be said with certainty about this supervisory body is that it is genuinely powerless in relation to the huge scope for abuse in the overall system. I must add, moreover, that what makes matters more alarming from the point of view of the rule of law is that the powers in question are linked to an extremely unclear concept of terrorism. I am able, in this Assembly, to say that the old Danish proverb applies here about selling elastic by the metre and, as my fellow countrymen know, that is something which only people of a very trustworthy character can do. There is no reasonable likelihood of the bodies concerned being of a sufficiently trustworthy character. The rule of law will sustain irreparable damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
