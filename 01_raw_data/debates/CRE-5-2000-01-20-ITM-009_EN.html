In Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, Lebanon, Chechnya and Kosovo, religious hatred and fanaticism are jeopardising peace, stability and development.</p>
<p class="contents">The advent of the new millennium was accompanied not only by parties and celebrations but also, unfortunately, by sacrifices of blood, the worst in recent years, on the altar of the blind hatred born of religious fanaticism. We do, of course, acknowledge the efforts made by the Egyptian Government to deal with the extremists and to compensate the victims of the massacres. However, these efforts must be stepped up, an in-depth investigation must be carried out, the guilty must be punished and, most importantly, measures must be taken to strengthen democracy, respect for human rights and tolerance towards people of a different religious persuasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, one measure which could be taken as a mark of respect for human rights would be to repeal the mediaeval punishment which continues to be applied in Egypt. I refer to the death penalty. As the new year gets under way, we know that the Egyptian police had difficulty suppressing clashes between Christians and Muslims in the south of the country which cost 25 lives and during which dozens of homes and shops were looted. These violent episodes in Egypt followed on from earlier episodes of bloody attacks by Islamic fundamentalists on Christians in 1992 and 1997, which seriously affected tourism in Egypt, with adverse repercussions on the economic and social development of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to use this vote to call on the Council and the Commission to plan action to increase public awareness of respect for human rights and religious tolerance within the framework of the MEDA programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, however, we believe that the proposed text does not warrant the use of urgent procedure. We believe this all the more because on studying the file, we have all noted that the facts reported do not have the political scope declared in the first recitals of the resolution before us. It is more a matter of infringements of common law in part of Egypt than acts resulting from religious antagonism.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, moreover, mention the inelegant way in which some of the paragraphs in the letter sent by the President of the Egyptian Parliament to the President of the European Parliament were simply copied out. Taking on arguments presented by others to defend oneself does not seem to me very commendable, even intellectually. Furthermore, knowing the aggressive interpretation that some Islamic circles give our initiatives, we are afraid of effectively giving them a weapon to show that the European Parliament is going too far in relation to a situation that does not justify such zealousness and such political determination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group will not, therefore, vote in favour of this resolution. We shall abstain, while reserving the right to table a motion for a resolution that should lead the European Parliament to take a view that is different to the very limited view of what is happening in Egypt and in the whole of North Africa in terms of the defence of the rights of minorities and democratic rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You may know that I am also the rapporteur on the association agreement between the European Union and Egypt. The negotiations on the technical files were completed last June and we should very soon be dealing with the finalised text. This agreement will, I hope, mark the advent of ever closer relations between Egypt, which is an essential force in the Middle East and the Mediterranean area, and the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The political situation has now reached a favourable point in the Middle East and I should like to stress this fact in order to place our action in the wider context. Through this resolution, the Parliament seeks to express its feelings about the events that have occurred but also to point out that it will be very vigilant with regard to the matter of human rights in the context of negotiations with our Mediterranean partners, as we are with all our partners. Our action has focused on protecting human rights and democracy, and I believe it is essential to show that we shall continue to take a hard line on these matters and encourage those who take steps in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not escaped the attention of this House that the Egyptian authorities reacted quickly, quite rightly, in order to undertake an on-the-spot enquiry and especially to organise aid for the victims of this violence. President Mubarak himself intervened at the height of the crisis. It is therefore quite clear, in my view, that this resolution should be considered as a positive sign and as encouragement on our part and I would ask all my colleagues to approve this text which is the result of a compromise. In this vein, I should like to thank those members who jointly signed this motion for the goodwill they showed in order to arrive at a joint text.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is true that this text has evolved, what is more, in association with the Egyptian authorities, which is a very good omen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, all we have observed, both from the international community and from our own European institution, is a long silence. It is true that Egypt plays a fundamental part in the peace process in the Middle East and its geopolitical situation means that nobody dares to speak up about distressing matters. We can only be delighted that a debate has finally been held on this country, a country that is at the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the debate is being held because of such an unfortunate current situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we support the efforts of the Egyptian government to combat the rise of religious fundamentalism, but this battle against the extremists cannot justify infringement of the rights of the Egyptian people, particularly their political rights. It cannot draw a veil over attacks on human rights such as freedom of expression and fundamental rights. In this regard, we condemn the fact that this country has retained the death penalty. Finally, we would ask the Council to make provision in the MEDA programme for specific measures in favour of social and economic development, the development of democracy and the promotion of tolerance between all the ethnic and cultural minorities that make up the richness of Egyptian society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been far too many cases for us to ignore with respect to religious intolerance, discrimination against ethnic minority groups and continued use of the death penalty. We also have concerns about the political freedoms in Hong Kong and in the future in Macao. It is right that we put pressure on China to improve its record. In the EU it is important that we continue that pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have two concerns. Firstly, we must be careful not to unnecessarily endanger China's accession to the WTO because WTO membership in the medium term would do more to transform China's economy and China's human rights situation than anything else. Opening up China and bringing it into the global economy must have positive consequences with respect to human rights. Many in China's ruling circles know and welcome this. We must be careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water, in acting to try to get the best and end up siding with the interests of the worst.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must continue to criticise China. I will continue to do so where necessary, but I hope we will not see an over-emphasis on China at the expense of other regimes in the world, whose records are as bad, if not worse. This only gives China an excuse to ignore our demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a continued crackdown on dissidents, on labour rights activists, on religious groups, and in recent months we have seen the detention without trial of many leaders of the Falun Gong movement. There are real problems in China with torture and forced labour camps. But, perhaps most seriously, more than 60 different offences are punishable by the death penalty, many of them non-violent offences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is judicial executions that are perhaps the greatest cause of concern. In 1998, Amnesty International recorded 2 700 death sentences and 1 769 confirmed executions.

By bringing this matter to the fore we are not seeking confrontation with China, a country for which we have great respect and considerable admiration. What a pity that the enormous economic progress made by China over the last ten years or so has not been matched by similar progress in political and religious freedom and the rule of law. Of course there must be dialogue on these matters but this must have a positive outcome in terms of genuine and substantive reforms. It is not acceptable to say that western norms are not applicable to China. Human rights are universal and, in this respect, Asian values are no different from our values.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hong Kong we see erosion of hard-won freedoms and guarantees. Maybe it is no surprise, however, that demonstrations about Tibet are banned there, when they are barely allowed in London, if the Chinese President is visiting.</p>
<p class="contents">In mainland China we should congratulate the recent leadership for getting rid of communism, but in its place we have seen the growth of a corrupted form of capitalism without democracy. The Chinese Government must stop the harassment and imprisonment of Christians, such as Li Dexian in Guandong province and the repression of Buddhists in Tibet and elsewhere. I call upon the Chinese authorities to have the courage to allow democrats such as Martin Lee to travel freely in mainland China. We want to see a China that is fully part of the international community, with true democracy and the rule of law. When will China set out a timetable for democracy?</p>

This political card weakens the moral authority of the EU to speak on the abuse of human rights elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the rapporteur for Hong Kong in this Parliament and I am concerned at the number of incidents which have happened in that part of the world which, once again, show abuse of human rights. The removal of Cheung Man-Yee as the broadcasting director of radio and television in Hong Kong was a direct attack on the freedom of the press and the decision of Hong Kong's SAR government to ask for reinterpretation of a recent unpopular high court ruling strikes at the heart of the rule of law when the decision of the final court of appeal should have been accepted. The treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and the refusal to allow LEGCO legislators to travel to mainland China are all indicative of the problems that remain in that part of the world and are issues which I will address in my report.

The most basic of democratic and human rights are not respected. Attempts to form political opposition are met with imprisonment, horrific punishments and expulsions. There are now thousands of political prisoners in the country. When they are not controlled by the Communist party, attempts to organise independent trade unions, together with union struggles for workers’ rights, are not tolerated. It is depressing to see how a state which pretends to act in the interests of the working class oppresses that self-same working class when the latter fights for its legitimate rights. The death penalty is imposed and carried out in a frightening number of cases. Religious freedom is not respected. The persecution of supporters of the Falun Gong movement is astounding and indefensible. Many minority peoples, such as the Tibetans, are oppressed and do not only lack democratic, but also cultural rights. There is a string of documented cases of violence and other outrages committed by prison staff and police. </p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a very good basis for the critical resolution we are to vote through in a while. I shall naturally be voting for it. That does not mean that I think that all parts of the text are perfect. I think, for example, that part of the content of paragraph 4 should have been expressed differently. I should also like to have seen a line in the resolution about the lack of union rights in China. We see, of course, how the Chinese government has reacted against the strikes and demonstrations and attempts at union organisation which we have seen in recent times. I should also like to warn against a development which involves toning down criticism of the lack of human rights in order to achieve economic and trading advantages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more reason why, and with much more forceful arguments, Parliament must now address the situation in China where the violation of human rights is reaching extremely high levels. Other speakers have already said all this and I can only agree with them. The real confirmation is that, in China, the human rights situation is deteriorating: while new economic processes are struggling to get underway, there is a terrible deterioration in human rights. Figures from Amnesty International tell of around 700 prisoners condemned to death; another source reports that as many as 1 400 executions were carried out last year. Whatever the true figure, this is clearly a terrible revelation. The problem, then, is how the Union and Parliament can respond to this situation. The first thing to do, in my opinion, is concentrate our efforts on the forthcoming meeting of the UN Committee on 20 March in Geneva where this will be the first item on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I wonder, and would ask the House, whether we can request that the Union, or even Parliament, be represented at this meeting. Above all, however, and this has already been said, it is important for the Union to not only speak out on this issue, but to manage to obtain a strong and determined common position of the individual countries as well. People were right to say that major positions taken by the Union are undermined if individual countries contradict them out of economic or commercial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, one issue should be considered: China’s request to join the World Trade Organisation. I realise that there are very positive aspects to this, and that, indirectly, it could be advantageous, but the request must not be linked with the UN’s global position nor, in this regard, with China’s firm request to make progress. In this way, maybe we will be able to move on from making appeals, which are necessary but insufficient, to practical action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament is therefore no longer alone in opposing the Council and the Commission which, for years, have followed a short-sighted policy in respect of the People’s Republic of China, a policy which, as in the case of the Soviet Union, is based on collusion with a dictatorial regime, a communist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">So the good news is that we have an ally in European businessmen and manufacturers. We should endeavour to strengthen this alliance in order to get the Council and the Commission to at last take a firm and tough line with regard to the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also have to take care to provide an option because, as you know, the communists only understand the language of force. So it is important that they should know that our words will be backed up by action and that our policy will be credible. We have, and I believe we should thank the Portuguese presidency for this, one possible major option that is feasible: we can establish a strategic alliance with the largest and most highly populated democracy in the world. I am speaking of India, and the Portuguese presidency, which announced the first summit to be held between the European Union and India, gives us the opportunity to work specifically to develop this option.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the only initiative that could bring the Chinese Communist authorities to understand that we are not speaking in vain and that we are working seriously to ensure that the Chinese communist empire collapses at last and that democracy is at last established in China and in Tibet, in Eastern Turkestan and in Lower Mongolia, which, like Chechnya, are places that are still subjected to savage colonisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These consist of more than 600 men and women dragged from their country by the defeated Iraqi forces when they withdrew, after having invaded and wrecked Kuwait ten years ago now.</p>
<p class="contents">These people are perfectly identifiable thanks to a particular circumstance: 4 000 prisoners were being held in Bassora at the end of the war. At that point the Iraqi military, in an initial operation, carried off some of their captives, possibly towards Baghdad. Then the Shiite rebellion erupted in Bassora. It was ferociously repressed, but the remaining 3 000 or more prisoners were able to escape and return to their country. Those who returned were therefore able to precisely identify those others who had been their fellow captives.</p>
<p class="contents">More then 600 disappearances in a population of 700 000 Kuwaitis is a very high number, and this case has therefore become a genuine national catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, and despite the efforts of the Red Cross and the United Nations, the Iraqi regime has been refusing to provide any information about the fate of these people. The material difficulties of the families have been resolved by the Kuwaiti authorities, but the human tragedy is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken to parents who have seen four sons disappear, wives who have seen their husbands taken away and young people who were children when their fathers were arrested. To the suffering of the victims themselves, we can therefore add the pain of their families and serious legal problems, such as those of the women who, after so much time, do not know whether they are married or widowed.</p>
<p class="contents">My conviction is that the international community must demand that Iraq provides a response to these cases. However terrible the response may be, the suffering of the families will be less than the current situation of uncertainty, which is unbearable for them and intolerable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by insisting on a point contained in the motion for a resolution. It recommends to the European Union and the Member States that, as a condition for normalising relations with Iraq, the leaders of that country must give answers to the question of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war. For the Group of the Party of European Socialists, this is as important as the demand that Iraq disarms from a nuclear, chemical and biological point of view. Let us hope that our resolution will serve both to encourage those, in Kuwait, who are maintaining pressure and hope, and as a warning to those in Iraq who are responsible for this grave situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Already back in 1992, the UN Commission on Human Rights’ special observer, Max van der Stoel, said that the seriousness of Iraq’s violations of human rights in the world context was only matched by the events of the Second World War. According to the most recent report dating from last year, the situation has only grown worse. We have to address this problem in one way or another. Prisoners of war are the first step, but the ordinary citizens are in a wretched state and, furthermore, weapons monitoring, for example, must be properly organised. This Ekeus affair – the row over it – is a good example. These matters must now be raised systematically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Is this problem sufficiently topical to justify the urgent procedure? In my view, it is. It is true that it is a problem which has lasted since the end of the war, for over 9 years, and the insistent demands which we, the European Parliament and the International Red Cross, have made have not so far been satisfied. At this point, I should like to endorse and emphasise what Mr Martínez Martínez has just told us. We should take the opportunity now to resume the negotiations between the European Union and Iraq with a view to possibly lifting the embargo. In my view this opportunity justifies bringing in the subject under the urgency procedure and justifies the motion for a resolution submitted for the vote of Parliament. If we do not take this opportunity, I believe that we shall be failing in our duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conflicts in Egypt which we were discussing earlier have not taken place, primarily, against a religious background but against an economic background, and the Egyptian state and the religious communities are making a responsible effort to defuse the problem. Egypt and Libya have taken an initiative to bring peace to Sudan to which we should give massive support. Syria is speaking to Israel, despite a myriad of problems. Only Iraq persists in total inaction and I am of the opinion that this should make us reconsider our position. We must pursue a clear human rights and disarmament policy against Saddam Hussein. However, I should like to support emphatically what Mr Morillon said; we need new negotiations now. We need a new approach if we really are to succeed in helping people, making progress, linking the possible easing of sanctions to actual progress, up to and including the naming of victims of persecution and imprisonment.

We are pleased that we can discuss it today. This is a good start. Indeed, the pipeline in question is the very controversial oil pipeline between Chad and Cameroon, two countries which score very badly in terms of human rights, the fight against poverty and legal certainty. The example of Ogoniland springs to mind if we think what harmful consequences the installation of an oil pipeline can have if the right precautions are not taken and the right guarantees not given.</p>
<p class="contents">It is even so bad that the oil pipeline is already casting its shadow forward, because those who dare criticise it in the country itself are quite simply thrown into prison in Chad. If this, now, is the way in which a constitutional state deals with environmental protest, one dreads to think what would happen in the case of more serious assaults when a corrupt regime is profiting from the existence of such a pipeline. We would therefore urge the European Investment Bank not to ape whatever the World Bank decides, because the World Bank is lobbying intensely so that it can support this pipeline and because we know that the people, the only representatives of civil society who were invited to be present at a protest meeting in America, were, in fact, lobbyists.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, highly concerned that the European Members who sit as Members on the Board of the World Bank will not have sufficient time to elucidate a precise position on this matter, simply because there is so little objective information available. That is why I ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that the European Investment Bank does not help support this pipeline, unless all social and environmental precautions have actually been taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have met with the Chad Government representatives who, contrary to claims of those on the other side of the Chamber, say they have not threatened to withdraw their invitation to Parliament's mission to Chad because we are holding this debate. Indeed, they claim that there is now observance of democracy, human rights and transparency in relation to this project.</p>
<p class="contents">But if that is so, why do we continue to receive reports of consultation at gunpoint? Why is one German development NGO threatening to pull out because of threats and attacks by the Chadian military? Why, on 4 January, did one expatriate resident in N'Djamena find her home attacked by Chadian soldiers? If the oil pipeline project is transparent, why do independent studies question its efficacy so fundamentally? For instance, Professor Rosenblum of Harvard questions the impact on poverty; Professor Downing of the University of Arizona concludes there is a failure to meet the World Bank indigenous peoples' guidelines; and the University of Warwick from my own country considers there will be a potential loss to national income from the project if potential spills and leaks are taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that the European Parliament should express its concern about a World Bank which is still pursuing the old policies of privatisation, major infrastructure projects and mass agricultural exports which have become so discredited. As for the oil companies themselves, why do they need to see the environmental protection requirements lifted, development controls waived and the unfettered right of action in the event of civil emergency which will allegedly give them ‘carte blanche to act as a paramilitary power’? Can the European Investment Bank really justify giving EUR 8 million direct to Exxon in these circumstances? We do not want to see another Ogoniland in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the fifth poorest nation in the world. Life expectancy is less than 50 years. One child in five dies before the age of 5. The annual per capita income is 180 dollars. Cameroon scarcely fares any better, with an income per inhabitant of around 650 dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I quoting you these figures? Simply because they express and illustrate the urgent need to offer these countries, particularly Chad, the development opportunities to which they are entitled. I believe that it is in this context that the great oil field project in the south of Chad and the construction of an oil pipeline between Chad and the Cameroon coast should be carefully examined. This project is now considered to be essential to the development of these two countries. Let us for a moment consider that the anticipated effects of operating these oil fields could increase the gross domestic product of Chad by almost 10 points and earn this country between 5 and 10 billion dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank, which has not yet issued its final opinion, is following this project very closely and is helping Chad to bring it to fruition. The three main points of discussion, i.e. the environment, social problems and the management of the income from the projects have been the subject of in-depth studies for almost four years. If this is anything to go by, 900 meetings have been held on the route of the oil pipeline, 40 000 people have given their opinions and 250 NGOs have been consulted. The director of one of these, the World Wide Fund for Nature, even said that in environmental terms, the project to install the oil pipeline is one of the best in the world. Nonetheless, we must, of course, continue to closely monitor the consequences of such a project and ensure that the absolute minimum amount of damage is done in environmental and human terms. That is the reason for the debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">If, by chance, on completion of these additional studies, the World Bank, whose criticisms I find hard to understand, were to give an unfavourable opinion, it would be out of the question to continue. But, on the other hand, if the Bank did, in the end, support this programme, it would mean that our legitimate fears could be allayed. It would also mean that our attention would for once actually be focussed on the development of the poorer countries, which we discuss frequently in this House. Human rights, ladies and gentlemen, also mean rights to development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why we need to be extra critical in our assessment of this project in terms of its relevance to development and environmental conditions. The proposed Chad-Cameroon pipeline could generate substantial revenue for these countries, revenue which cannot be obtained in any other way. My Group notes that the original plans were punctuated by major objections. The plans have since been adapted on all these points and it remains to be seen whether this is now sufficient. We are of the opinion that the project can only be passed in the short term if it has been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it meets the strictest criteria, if the World Bank has given the green light explicitly and unambiguously and if, at the same time, it is absolutely clear that human rights are no longer being violated. Only if this is the case is the European Investment Bank free to grant loans. As far as our Group is concerned, it is a test case of whether it is possible to have good experiences with oil projects in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It notes the measures already adopted by the Egyptian government to restore calm to the region and is very pleased about its commitment to bring those responsible to justice. It awaits with interest the preliminary report by the Egyptian public prosecutor, which is due out next week.</p>
<p class="contents">From the first signs, the recent incidents would appear to be fundamentally different to those that occurred in August 1998, which were essentially triggered by the violent reaction and the incompetence of the police and not by any sectarian behaviour on their part. The recent events, however, appear to be of a religious nature, although they were set off by a simple trading dispute. In Upper Egypt, as elsewhere, chronic under-development can exacerbate religious tensions dangerously, which is the reason why the measures to restore harmony between the different communities must go hand in hand with socio-economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of its cooperation with Egypt, the Commission is endeavouring primarily to find a balance between measures to modernise the economy and social measures, including measures to combat poverty and to promote a civil society and human rights. Upper Egypt is one of the regions covered by the social measures and measures to combat poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as China is concerned, the Commission shares the concerns of Members of Parliament about the human rights situation in China, particularly in Tibet. These matters were discussed at the highest level at the second European Union-China summit on 21 December 1999 in Peking. On 14 January, the Union also made a formal approach to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing its serious concerns about the fate of political dissidents, the freedom of worship of members of Christian churches and the treatment meted out to some followers of the Falun Gong movement. These matters, as well as conditions of imprisonment, labour camps, freedom of speech, freedom of association and the rights of women and ethnic minorities will also be on the agenda at the next European Union-China talks on human rights to be held on 25 February in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">After this meeting and these talks, and in the light of the results, the position to be adopted by the Union at the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights will be defined. The Union considers that the improvement of the human rights situation in China and that country’s negotiations for membership of the WTO are two major issues that should be dealt with separately, using specific instruments and in specific forums. In general, the Commission believes that the opening up of the economy and the liberalisation of trade that will speed up China’s membership of the WTO will, in the long term, favour improvements in human rights, the strengthening of civil society and the formation of the rule of law in China and it will pay special attention to these latter aspects in the context of the World Trade Organisation talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Tibet has already been widely discussed through existing channels of communication with the Chinese authorities. Also, the ambassadors of the troika in 1998 sent an observer mission to Tibet and the Commission is committed to continuing along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problem of the Gulf War prisoners in Iraq, the Commission, like Parliament, is concerned about Iraq’s lack of cooperation with regard to the missing Kuwaitis and is aware of the intolerable effect this situation must have on their families. The Commission urges Iraq to respect the United Nations Security Council resolutions in this regard and the International Committee of the Red Cross, as you have emphasised, has been given responsibility for the case of the missing Kuwaitis, in accordance with these United Nations resolutions. Unfortunately, however, Iraq refuses to cooperate, even with the mediation of this international organisation. The Commission supports the efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross and, as the Commission does not have any contractual relations with Iraq, there is therefore no official dialogue with the Iraqi government.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to assure you that the Commission is fully behind the regime of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, which form a response to the tragic human rights situation in that country. But, and I believe this is also an important point, as some of you have mentioned, despite these infringements of United Nations Security Council resolutions by Iraq, the Commission will continue, through the intermediary of ECHO, to provide humanitarian aid to the Iraqis to alleviate their suffering. The Commission is the main supplier of humanitarian aid to Iraq, to the tune of EUR 240 million since 1991 and, in the context of its programme for the year 2000, ECHO has released EUR 10 million for humanitarian aid for Iraq. We therefore make a clear distinction between the people and the constraints with regard to human rights that are the work of the Iraqi State. The Commission will support all the measures in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the human rights violations in Chad and Cameroon are concerned, in conjunction with the current planning of the oil pipeline, the European Commission is closely following this situation with regard to extending the democratic process, the protection of human rights and reinforcement of the rule of law. It is also focusing its attention on the oil project planned in the south of the country which will cross Cameroon. The Commission is not directly involved in financing this project, but it has, on several occasions, shown understanding for Chad’s right to wish to manage its only resource, provided that the necessary precautions are taken with respect to the protection of the environment and the protection of the rights of the local people, on the one hand, and the actual allocation of the future oil revenue to the development of the country, on the other. We shall ensure that the European Investment Bank is informed of these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">In Chad, the operation of the oil project could be a very important factor in the country’s development and in consolidating the rule of law if this revenue is used advisedly. That is why the European Commission is endeavouring to encourage the government to continue the dialogue on the questions raised by the oil project with the country’s main partners, including with itself and to involve the local authorities and the non-governmental organisations closely in the preparatory work. This is so that the progress already made on the most critical aspects of the oil project can be consolidated, if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
