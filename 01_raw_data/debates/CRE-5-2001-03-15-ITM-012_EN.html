<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is competent ‘to protect the conditions of life and work, including the work environment’. This fine definition authorises us, therefore, to examine the situation of our assistants. Indeed it obliges us to do so. It would be odd if the committee I have the honour of chairing were responsible for all workers in Europe, the sole exception being the assistants in the European Parliament. That has, in fact, been the strange situation up to the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Far be it from me, however, to trespass on the competencies of the specific bodies of the European Parliament! That is why, Commissioner, when we heard the representatives of the assistants, we did it in the presence and with the cooperation of Vice-President Onesta, who was instructed by the Bureau of our Parliament to deal with these problems. Now the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to make its contribution to the quest for innovative solutions. Most of our colleagues are fully familiar with the problems faced by the assistants, which range from job insecurity to the difficulties of legal establishment on Belgian territory, where many of them live. </p>
<p class="contents">The Bureau of the European Parliament has already taken a crucial internal decision designed to improve transparency in the management of secretarial allowances, which was mentioned in Mr Onesta’s report. I welcome this decision. It will enable assistants to have an employment contract in the prescribed form, social security cover, which not all of them have, and occupational accident insurance. There are, however, other problems that have not been resolved. These relate essentially to the specific situation of assistants, who are de facto cross-border workers, without their rights as such being recognised. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the expert study commissioned by the European Commission contemplated using existing European legislation on the free circulation of workers and to incorporate into it the specific situation of parliamentary assistants. This solution appears both realistic and reasonable. It is realistic because much vaunted Regulation No1408/71, which all my parliamentary colleagues are familiar with and which governs the free circulation of workers, students and pensioners, etc, is not a text which has been set in stone. For more than five years it has been subjected by the Council to a process of simplification, dusting-down and improvement, which is to be wound up under the Belgian Presidency. At least that is what the European Parliament hopes. </p>
<p class="contents">This year we are being presented with amendments to the text. During the last part-session I think I understood correctly that a large number of my fellow Members wanted a general overhaul of the text rather than just technical improvements. Nonetheless, in February we approved the last amendment that both the Council and the Commission asked us to approve. In other words this text could easily be modified and adapted to the situation of the assistants and it could enable them to choose the country of establishment when it comes to matters of social security payments and it could guarantee their other rights to social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This realistic solution is also reasonable. The Council wanted the European Parliament to reform its relations with its assistants in the name of transparency. This first step was achieved thanks to the decision to which I have referred. It does not wish to tackle tax issues. Recourse to Regulation No 1408/71 does not make this necessary. Fine! The Council does not want to give assistants the status of officials. This is not what we are asking – it is very different. What we want is simply to guarantee their fundamental rights to social protection. In other words, all the conditions have now been met and we can now make real headway in this area. That is the reason, Commissioner, for our question to the Commission, which has always expressed its determination to make headway in this area hand-in-hand with the European Parliament. The Commission has the political initiative, but we now ask it to make use of it and to formally present a proposal to amend Regulation No 1408/71 by adding a simple subparagraph covering the situation of the assistants. It is then up to the Council to shoulder its responsibilities and to decide whether or not to keep our assistants and ourselves in a state of legal and social uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has already embarked on internal work to set the ball rolling. The way forward depends on the normal legislative process. It is up to the Commission to put forward a proposal now and Parliament will then be able to complete its work to issue internal regulations to deal with the question of the assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the thinking behind our question to the Commission. Within what timeframe, Commissioner, will this crucial text be proposed? The best solution would be before the start of the Belgian Presidency, since our assistants work in Belgium. It is a pressing matter, Commissioner, and it also affects the ethics and image of our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1998 the Commission, with Parliament's agreement, drew up a proposal to amend the conditions of employment for other staff so that Parliamentary assistants would become auxiliary staff. I happened to be the Commissioner responsible at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This would have ensured equal treatment for assistants in terms of their salary, employment conditions and tax, with a choice of a social security system. As you know, however, this proposal was not accepted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">By agreement with the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission then commissioned an expert study with various solutions that would be compatible with Community law and the interests of the assistants and the Members of Parliament. The experts suggested that one aspect of the assistants' legal status could be dealt with by another Community instrument, namely Regulation No 1408/71, which coordinates the social security schemes of the Member States. The assistants are already covered by this regulation and it brings them, in principle, under the social security system of the Member State where they work.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice-President Onesta has contacted my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, suggesting that the Commission puts forward a proposal to the Council and Parliament for an amendment to this regulation, allowing assistants to chose between the Member State where they work, the Member State where they were last insured or the Member State of which they are a national. A similar option is already available to auxiliary staff of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an amendment would only resolve a very specific and small part of the assistants' legal position and would not exonerate them from the obligations of national law in regard to labour conditions, tax and social security. However, the Commission has committed itself to finding solutions which are in the interests of both assistants and Members of Parliament. The suggested amendment can indeed clarify the legal position of the assistants as far as their social security rights are concerned. It seems that the application of Regulation No 1408/71 to this category of workers still gives rise to uncertainty, which can be removed by the amendment. Once they have made a choice there should be no further misunderstanding as to which Member State 's system they are subject to.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it seems justified to derogate from the general rules of the regulation for persons working on a temporary basis for members of Community institutions, such as auxiliary staff. My draft then reads as follows: ‘Therefore the Commission intends to propose shortly to Parliament and Council the suggested amendment to Regulation No 1408/71’. If asked what ‘shortly’ means, I can say that it will be before the summer. That means that this issue can be decided during the Belgian Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before this, I dealt with this subject as a journalist for a daily newspaper, so I think I know the subject from all three sides that are particularly involved here. I would therefore like to say that I welcome the fact that with our provisional arrangement we have found something that both preserves flexibility and affords security and that the Court of Auditors has also accepted as a sensible and workable system, although I do have a problem with changing the contract basis in mid-period. I think that should really always be settled at the start of the period.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are looking at the final assistants’ statute, and we naturally welcome such an assistants’ statute. But I would like to sound a warning against excessive bureaucracy and inflexibility. There are rumoured to be plans for all assistants to be subject to Belgian law. That would not only be a problem for the many staff we maintain in our constituencies, because the very purpose of that is to strengthen feedback to the constituency, but it would also fail to take account of the structure of our Parliament’s work, because following the Council’s decision this House has its seat in Strasbourg and holds its plenary sessions here. As a result, it is often more sensible for Members from southern Germany and from France, for example, to employ an assistant for Strasbourg and for their constituency than to bring the Brussels assistant to Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament. There is therefore no point in making assistants who work here, for example, subject to Belgian law. Brussels is an important place of work, but it is just a place of work, like Luxembourg. I therefore believe the system must be flexible, that there must be a freedom of choice here that does justice both to Parliament’s three places of work, to the seat in Strasbourg and to the need for constituency work. I therefore believe that the Council, Commission and Parliament must find an arrangement that gives our assistants security but which, as I said, takes account of this Parliament’s specific working conditions, which it did not set for itself, and which enables Members to make arrangements under the laws of the Member State where they were elected or to use an arrangement that does equal justice to their manner, structure and style of work and to the legitimate social interests of our assistants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I think we can congratulate ourselves on having brought a question before this House today which has been pending for far too long. It is impossible not to be surprised at this inability to resolve a precarious situation which affects the parliamentary assistants, people who assist us on a daily basis, whilst we are competent to legislate on certain aspects of the conditions of life and work of all the citizens of the fifteen Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact a question of finding solutions to crucial and fundamental issues concerning social protection, the employment statute, occupational accidents and all the issues of social cover with which we are so familiar, so that we can deal with them in relation to all the workers in the fifteen Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of making an effort to clarify the definition of their working conditions, which, I admit, are rather the preserve of internal meetings. This issue has been raised over a very long period of time by our group and, as we have just been reminded, by other groups as well.</p>
<p class="contents">During the previous legislative period of the European Parliament, proposals to formalise the statute came up against the reluctance of the Council to turn assistants into officials and to include the tax dimension of the problem in the equation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that today, however, we should be clear about what our objectives are. These demands are now no longer written in this way in the agenda. It is clear that we do not want to turn our assistants into Community officials, just as it would be out of place to want to link the issue of the assistants’ statute to that of Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, as was expressed so well by Mr Rocard, do you vie with each other to complicate an issue where the stakes are so clear and so legitimate, and which may find solutions in procedures that are perfectly ordinary, accessible and simple?</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue today is to see how the Commission is going to follow up the work, which it asked an expert to carry out on this matter. It is true that the recent developments introduced by the Bureau of the European Parliament – the provision of contracts in the prescribed form and documents testifying to membership of a social security system and of an occupation accident insurance scheme – are good decisions, but the matter does not end there. It would be extremely important, for instance, to be able to check the information which is gathered.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the proposal put forward to regard our assistants as genuine cross-border workers so that they can consequently have recourse to Regulation No 1408/71, to which we just have to add a subparagraph in order to cover them, seems entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our assistants expect the Commission to take the initiative. The Belgian Presidency would be doing itself credit by bringing this affair to a successful conclusion. However, Commissioner, you have just told us that proposals will be forthcoming before the summer. Thank you. We look forward to them. We thank you above all on behalf of all the assistants who work in this House.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, if I may begin on a personal note it is now nearly two years since I was campaigning on an election platform that stressed the need for proper statutes for Members and their assistants. It is extremely embarrassing to have to admit to the public at home just how slow progress has been where both statutes are concerned. Of the two, I am more embarrassed in respect of the assistants' statute because this is a case where as MEPs we are directly responsible in matters affecting the lives of others.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is grateful to the Commission for its approach to Professor Vandersanden and for the proposals that he has made. We have not yet discussed in detail his substantive suggestions as to what should be done within the Parliament's own rules of procedure. We may therefore find ourselves disagreeing with these suggestions in various respects. We do however believe that his methodology which distinguishes between what might be achieved under these rules and what actually requires legislation are a promising route forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very glad to hear of the outcome of the trialogue and the Commission's statement today promising proposals for the revision of Regulation No 1408/71. We would add however that whatever scheme is ultimately adopted, and by whatever means, it must have certain characteristics. First, it must be simple. It must be simple both in terms of clarity and in terms of its administration. Second, it must provide the legal certainty. This means that it must be comprehensive in its coverage of the employment relationship. This need not mean rigidity and uniformity. It means only that, for example, all assistants must be properly covered for any accidents occurring to them in the course of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, it must be transparent. In my own personal view we should be trying to move towards a system where there is equal pay for work of equal value. Given though that assistants may be employed in a number of different locations and have different tasks to perform, this may be difficult to achieve. We should at least however seek to ensure that no one is allowed to fall below a certain minimum and that the reasons for any differentials are clear. I believe that in the long term there can be no substitute for a proper statute but we do at least now have an initial path to follow. I hope that we move down it as rapidly as we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you too Mr Rocard, in your role as chairman of the specialist committee, for speaking to you, Commissioner, on behalf of the European Parliament, because it is clear that, as concerns this statute, we are moving very slowly. Our Parliament has been in existence for so many years yet we are still trying to settle this issue, which should have been taken off the agenda years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">You have given us some good news. The pace is to be speeded up. We can all rejoice at that. What is the current state of play? The Council asked us to abandon the route towards turning our assistants into officials. We complied. We withdrew this document, which had caused the Council so many problems, from the negotiating table. The Council asked Parliament to get rid of any reference to taxation. We complied, and the assistants themselves acknowledge that they are prepared to relinquish any reference to taxation as long as they get a proper statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also asked us to take all the necessary measures to ensure transparency and, as our fellow Members have reminded us, everything is in hand. In a few weeks’ time, no Member of Parliament we will be able to have access to their budget line to pay their assistants if they have not first made an appropriate declaration to the parliamentary services – and I did my duty as an employer this afternoon. They will therefore not have access to their budget line until they have handed in a copy of all their contracts, in the prescribed form, together with proof that their assistants have full social cover and are well protected in the event of an occupational accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in a few weeks’ time, the whole of Europe will know the names of our assistants. We are really going to come out into the open, because, at present, no Member of Parliament is able to provide the list of all those people who work so hard to ensure that the European Community functions properly.</p>
<p class="contents">So, here we are. We have taken the steps we were asked to take. We would not understand it if, now, the Commission did not do what it always said it would do in the many varied contacts we have had, that it was ready, when the time came, to take the decisive step to finally enable us to have a legal basis to take us forward. We would not understand it if, once this step had been taken by the Commission, the Council, which has always told us, whether it be under the Finnish Presidency, the Portuguese Presidency, the French Presidency and now the Swedish Presidency, that it too was ready to do its bit, did nothing. Parliament has done its bit. It is now up to the other institutions to do theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done? I believe that the report by Mr Vandersanden, which you, Commissioner, masterminded and circulated, is a good working base. Modifying Regulation No 1408/71 is the right thing to do because then we will have something simple and consistent and we will finally be able to give our assistants a statute which does not suffer from any legal debate. It is not a question of seeking to harmonise social protection systems, but simply to coordinate policies, which amending this regulation will allow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let no one tell us that this is complicated, even though unanimity is required in Council. Since 1997, it has been possible to make no fewer than five amendments to this regulation and always unanimously. Give us a legal basis. In the working group I lead, in which all the political groups are represented, Parliament is finally debating this issue with a united voice. All the political groups are united in asking you to take this decisive step.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, once you have taken this decisive step and, we hope, the Council has followed your example, we will not have a real assistants’ statute. There will still not be a code of ethics, a collective agreement and a system of equalisation to ensure fairness amongst all assistants, as my colleague from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party said, where there is equal pay for work of equal value. This system of fairness can be introduced in the form of an equalisation fund at the level of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Give us this legal basis and we will do the rest. We need you to take this decisive step. Our fellow Members have said so. Legality, simplicity, transparency and a high level of social protection are called for. If you give us legality, we will guarantee simplicity, transparency and a high level of social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For too long now our parliamentary assistants have worked without being protected by a statute. Although the vast majority of Members of Parliament have guaranteed them correct working and salary conditions, it must be acknowledged that the practices of a number of our colleagues has somewhat tarnished the image of the European Parliament. The lack of control and transparency in the management of secretarial allowances paved the way for abuse. And, as Jacques Loyau, President of the Association of Assistants, deplored at the time, in the absence of a safeguard, everything was possible and there were considerable disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">A survey carried out by the Association of Assistants more than a year ago highlighted a worrying situation. Fourteen per cent did not have a contract of employment; 12% had only external consultant contracts, even though they worked full time, and 53% did not have any social cover or accident insurance. This survey served as the basis for the action taken by the parliamentary assistants and their Association, which our group supported from its beginnings. Some initial results were obtained within the European Parliament with the adoption, by the Bureau, of the amendment to Article 14 of the rules on the costs and allowances of Members of Parliament. As our President, Nicole Fontaine, stressed at the time that the matter of the assistants had made significant and concrete headway and that the transitory measures which had been adopted reflected the will and determination of the European Parliament to move towards greater transparency and fairness in this area..</p>
<p class="contents">These measures, which came into force on 1 January this year, have indeed enabled us to strengthen our control over the use of the secretarial allowance and to guarantee each assistant a contract of employment, health insurance and occupation accident insurance. This progress, which has been made thanks to the perseverance of the Association of Assistants and to the efficient work of our Vice-President, Gérard Onesta, served as a base for our negations with the Council. However, as we have heard, for months now, despite our best efforts, this matter seems to have been deadlocked. I am therefore very interested to hear that an agreement has been reached in principle between the Commission and the European Parliament to amend the free movement of workers regulation along the lines the assistants would like to see. I welcome this. It seems that the way is now clear for us to be able to move forwards very soon towards a European statute whereby, in the words Parliament chose in its opinion of 11 March 1999, assistants are treated equally and in accordance with the work they carry out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, that does not mean that Members are not first and foremost responsible for their assistants’ having sound labour contracts, including social security, good working conditions and insurance policies. It is primarily up to us to put proper arrangements in place. Unfortunately, we have now discovered that we have failed in this respect, and that there is now an extra need for a sound statute for our assistants. The EDD Group is lending its unqualified support to the assistants’ legitimate wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final remark in this connection. Vast discrepancies between the EP permanent staff, the temporary staff of the groups and the assistants are not justified, particularly as they, to a large extent, do the same type of work. The Council should perhaps reconsider precisely what now constitute unjustified discrepancies. Indeed, we must repudiate discrimination at all times. The freedom of assistants to choose the social system under which they want to work is of great importance, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to concur with Mr Posselt who has warned against too much red tape. It is already very complex and time-consuming to act in the correct manner. Members should also have the freedom to employ assistants in their own Member States or in Brussels, and we should not be restricted in this choice in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have some speaking time left, but Commissioner Liikanen has managed to reassure me to a great extent. I wish him a lot of success and hope that the activities will indeed be completed before the summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was right to raise the matter again, authoritatively, clearly and incontrovertibly, since Parliament has repeatedly made commitments on the issue. I would also stress, in addition to the indisputable nature of these commitments, the role of the socialists who, particularly within the Committee on Budgets, have fought on the front line every year to ensure that these commitments are included in the budget lines, and they will do so on this occasion with regard to this operation too.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, the Bureau and the Vice-President and Commissioner Liikanen have made somewhat significant commitments. These commitments are a step in the right direction although they are still not a full response. We need to provide a definitive, comprehensive response dealing with national insurance contributions, tax and salaries, and the rights and responsibilities associated with an – albeit temporary – position.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for swift action, for it is our duty to ensure the greatest possible transparency and total legality of a relationship, certain aspects of which still make a mockery of respect for workers’ rights and the principles which we desire to uphold for all and which we must protect, especially for those who work with us. It is our duty to guarantee respect for the dignity of these professionals who, moreover, make a valuable, high-quality contribution to our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish to begin by welcoming in particular the initiative presented here by our colleague, Mr Rocard, to bring into the open a debate which must be conducted with the utmost transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, from a personal point of view, I would even argue for a common statute for parliamentary assistants based on the categories currently laid down in the Staff Regulations. The revision proposed as a joke by Commissioner Kinnock might even be a good opportunity to lay down a decision of this type. In any event, I suspect that we are a long way from that point. We must therefore do the best with what we have and with solutions which may be enshrined in European instruments, such as the Staff Regulations, but which represent only one possible approach towards a future European statute.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the new rules adopted by Parliament on the situation of parliamentary assistants are nothing more than internal regulations. We must ensure the transparency of the contracts, public recruitment procedures, the requirement for an effective system of social protection and the payment of tax in each of the Member States. These rules are an expression of our political will but they also reveal the weakness of Parliament’s powers to regulate an entire statute for parliamentary assistants, which involves, of course, much more than just these issues. In any event, now that these rules have been agreed on, I am sure that there is a broad majority in this House, and this can be seen in the Bureau, in the Contact Group and in the speeches that have been made here, that wishes the Council to frame in law what is already being practised, affecting only our institutions, through an amendment to Regulation No 1408/71, which is a general rule covering migrant workers. Ultimately, by means of the amended base Regulation which applies to all the Member States, we want parliamentary assistants to be given the right, as migrant workers, to be able to choose to be governed by the legislation of the country that is most relevant to their work, which is divided between Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and the country of origin of the Member of the European Parliament for whom they work. We have been informed today, by Commissioner Liikanen, that the Commission is, at last, going to get the ball rolling on this dossier. We will then begin to emerge from the tunnel in which we are stuck if the Belgian Presidency manages to close this dossier. Later, if the Belgian Presidency is successful, we will have to conclude the work. That, however, Mr President, is simply a matter of tidying up loose ends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs took the decision to put this question to you, it had three objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first was to assure our assistants publicly that this matter was being taken on board by the European Parliament. We have done that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second was to make sure that the Commission, which itself had commissioned the expert, Mr Vandersanden, was prepared to capitalise on its work and to follow it up by taking precise administrative action. You have pledged to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third objective was to have a timetable, which was particularly related to the fact that the Belgian Presidency was just around the corner and that the problem essentially concerned Belgian social security.

<p class="contents">Just now, our fellow Member, Mr Pittella, justifiably called on us to arrive at a full and final solution to the problem of the assistants, and he was right to do so. We all know, however, that this will take time and it will involve a number of different stages and much effort. We need the involvement of the three institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament. We can, though, only do our work once you have done yours. The essential stage is always the next one.

In this afternoon’s urgent debate our group, the largest in the House, had only 12 minutes to share out, apart from the minutes allowed to the proposers. It was uncommonly difficult to accommodate everyone. We had to disappoint a large number of colleagues. In light of this experience, I would therefore ask that the groups in future be given a little more speaking time in urgent debates than is currently the case. The present method of calculation is clearly not altogether realistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This morning I had occasion to use the tram system in Strasbourg for the first time. I was very impressed by the system, which I suppose it is not surprising, since the trams were actually built in the United Kingdom. But it does seem somewhat ironic to me that we have been voting in this place all week to save the planet but we still ride around Strasbourg in our chauffeur-driven Mercedes.</p>
<p class="contents">Could Parliament perhaps consider giving Members detailed instructions on how to use the tram system and the routes that are available, and maybe even give us a couple of complimentary tickets to get us started. It is an excellent system and, incidentally, we could save the taxpayers some money by using it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
