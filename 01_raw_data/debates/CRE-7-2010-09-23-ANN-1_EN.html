<p>The Commission, in its Second Strategic Energy Review, highlighted the need to identify energy projects’ financing requirements and potential sources of financing for them. According to Mario Monti’s report on ‘A New Strategy for the Single Market’, targeted EU funding for energy infrastructure needs to be stepped up. On March 2009, the Council invited the Commission to present its proposal for a new EU Energy Security and Infrastructure Instrument in early 2010. The Commission’s working programme indicates that it plans to present this instrument by the end of November 2010.

<p>(EN) Further integration of energy grids is one of the major political priorities for Europe and will be so for the foreseeable future, be it within Member States, between Member States and even beyond the borders of the European Union. For without sufficient energy infrastructure, we will not reach our commonly agreed objectives in terms of market integration, security of supply and climate change.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing a Communication, which will, based on the experiences of the current Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) policy framework and against the background of a new regulatory and political context (Third Energy Internal Market Package<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, 20-20-20 targets, etc), define the key issues and priorities for the development of energy infrastructure for decades to come. This Communication should notably provide answers on what the EU can do to enable and facilitate the building of new energy grids in order to ease the achievement of the EU objectives on market integration, security of supply and climate change.</p>
<p>The Communication should further present a new method of strategic planning to identify and agree on concrete projects of European interest accompanied by a set of tools necessary to implement these projects.</p>
<p>The Communication will also address the question of the financing needs of future infrastructure investments. It should be followed, in 2011, by a legislative proposal for a new EU Energy Security and Infrastructure Instrument. The objective of the latter is to identify a means to fill the investment gap, based on further improving both infrastructure cost allocation, and the effectiveness of EU instruments and better leveraging of public and private funding. It should also cover the issue of financial support for projects. Such funding would concern projects, which would not be realised at all or not be delivered on time by the market alone.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Directive on renewable energy<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> sets legally binding targets for the share of renewable energy for Member States. Thus Greece is under the legal obligation to ensure that the consumption of renewable energy in Greece increases from approximately 8% today to 18% in 2020.</p>
<p>Feed-in tariffs that provide a guaranteed price for a fixed period are a very well known means of support creating a stable framework for developing renewables. It is thus a common tool that many Member States use. Whilst the Commission notes that the tariffs offered by Greece are amongst the highest in Europe, it remains the responsibility of the Greek Government to implement all the policies necessary to achieve the target, as set out in its National Renewable Energy Action Plan<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and to do so in an economically efficient manner. In this respect, the Directive has created a "cooperation mechanism" to allow Member States to help each other achieve their targets cost effectively.</p>
<p>The Commission is sponsoring Member States' discussions on the most effective means of implementing the Directive, through a Concerted Action project of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme. This Concerted Action will also reflect on Member States' support schemes and their relative efficacy. It will thus help Member States reform their schemes to ensure that they take full account of all relevant economic, social and technical factors and impacts. Such issues will also be addressed in the Commission's forthcoming Energy Strategy 2020 and subsequent report on the financing of renewable energy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission continues to closely monitor the energy situation in the Baltic region, and in particular the various plans for new nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Kaliningrad, Belarus (and Poland). Both bilateral contacts and cooperation at international level, i.e. under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are needed to ensure that nuclear power plants in the EU's neighbourhood fulfill high standards of safety and security.</p>
<p>Russia, Belarus, the Euratom Community and its Member States are Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and to other relevant international conventions concluded under the IAEA, such as on early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident. Under the Nuclear Safety Convention, a Contracting Party is obliged to consult other Contracting Parties in the vicinity of a proposed nuclear installation, insofar as they are likely to be affected by that installation. This Convention also sets the framework of safety standards to be applied by the Contracting Parties.</p>
<p>Russia has communicated to the Commission the Environmental Impact Assessment report for the Kaliningrad nuclear power plant, has presented the project in the framework of the EU-Russia energy dialogue and has expressed its willingness to hold consultations with the EU. This issue has also been discussed with the Member States in the Council and the Commission will continue to raise it in its contacts with Russian authorities, highlighting the need for transparency.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that the issue of the Belarus nuclear power plant project is raised and thoroughly discussed in the framework of the EU-Belarus energy dialogue. The Commission has asked Belarus to keep the Commission informed with developments related to the ratification and implementation of the IAEA's Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards. The Commission has also expressed its readiness to cooperate with the relevant Belarus authorities in order to establish an independent, transparent and efficient Regulator.</p>
<p>Effective interconnection of the Baltic Sea region was identified as one of the six priority energy infrastructure projects in the Second Strategic Energy Review adopted by the Commission in November 2008.

The two main goals of the BEMIP initiative, within the context of the EU's 20/20/20 objectives are the full integration of the three Baltic States into the European energy market, through the strengthening of interconnections with their EU neighboring countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0443"></a>

<p>More generally, what is the state of play with regard to these common efforts, including the joint proposal by Jacques Delors and Jerzy Buzek to establish a European Energy Community?

<p>(EN) The Commission has communicated to the Polish authorities its concerns regarding the Polish-Russian Intergovernmental Agreement's compliance with the provisions of the EU law. The Commission's concerns relate, amongst other issues, to the management of the Yamal pipeline against the background of the unbundling provisions in the third liberalisation package.</p>
<p>The third liberalisation package is one of the cornerstones of the EU's energy policy. One of its main principles is that all companies willing to sell gas in any Member State are able to do so by using an infrastructure that is managed independently and for fair fees. Open and competitive markets for gas with pipelines accessible to all suppliers increase security of supply because gas can be supplied where demand emerges. Intergovernmental Agreements which do not respect the rules of this package clearly undermine common energy policy.</p>
<p>The internal market rules apply to actors in the EU market from the EU and third countries alike. Defending the functioning of the EU market is therefore a natural aspect of a coherent and viable external energy policy.</p>
<p>The Member of the Commission responsible for Energy communicated this in his talks with the Polish authorities and also raised these issues with the Russian side. The Commission will continue to support Poland in these negotiations. Member States cannot be exposed to a choice between implementing EU law on their territory and supplies of gas.</p>
<p>As regards infrastructure interconnecting industrial Member States and regions in the European Union, in November 2010 the Commission will issue a Communication on Energy Infrastructure outlining the necessary developments in this area. Several infrastructure projects have also received support from the European Energy Programme for Recovery, including in the Baltic States.</p>
<p>Furthermore, next year the Commission expects results from the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) gas working group, which meets regularly to identify projects of common interest and identify and overcome barriers to such projects. Clear political support for the Poland-Lithuania pipeline is a positive signal as this is a crucial project to end the isolation of the Baltic region.</p>
<p>The Commission shares much of the analysis and the objectives of Mr Buzek and Mr Delors included in the proposal to strengthen European energy policy. Nevertheless, at least for the time being, the Commission prefers to set up such a European energy policy on the basis of the existing treaties and legal instruments, as referred to above, instead of launching a new institutional debate. The Commission is convinced that the potential of the Lisbon Treaty and in particular its Article 194, if exploited to the full, would make it possible to make far-reaching progress in this direction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0452"></a>

<p>(EN) Levels of business investment in research and innovation in the EU are clearly unsatisfactory. Take the percentage of Research and Development (R&amp;D) funded by the private sector, which is 55% in the EU compared to 67% in the United States, 70% in China and 78% in Japan — and the EU figure has been decreasing in recent years. Looking at this in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is equally disturbing. Research expenditures by firms have stagnated at around 1.2% of EU GDP, compared to 2.1% in the US. In China, the figure is quickly approaching the EU level.</p>
<p>To address these problems, the Commission is working on a set of actions related to access to finance, which is a key bottleneck for, in particular, innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p>The Commission is looking into attracting more private funding for innovative enterprises by considerably strengthening EU-level financial instruments to address market gaps in loans and venture capital, notably in cooperation with the European Investment Fund and the European Investment Bank. It is also considering actions to improve the use of cohesion funds to support research and innovation capacities. Also the State aid framework needs to be reviewed to ensure that all forms of innovation can be adequately supported.</p>
<p>A further set of actions under development will aim to create a single innovation market.</p>
<p>The EU patent should be quickly agreed on, and the Commission is looking into all options to ensure that this is achieved at last. As regards markets for innovative goods and services, the Commission will propose screening and adapting the regulatory frameworks concerned. Europe's standardisation system needs to be reviewed with the aim of closing the gap between research and standardisation in order to better support innovation. And the Commission is planning actions to enhance the public procurement of innovative products and services.</p>
<p>Beyond actions that can be taken or coordinated at EU level, national research and innovation systems are essential for establishing a single innovation market. These will be more effective if they share some broad characteristics that are recognised as common to well-performing systems and represent best practice. Therefore, the Commision proposes to develop, with Member States, a limited number of policy features for national research and innovation systems. Constructive discussions are already underway.</p>
<p>This development of such a set of policy features builds on the activities conducted for many years under CREST, to support mutual learning and exchange of best practice between the Member States. This has been very effective. It can be seen from the Commission's contacts and monitoring activities that national research and innovation policies have evolved considerably in recent years towards more effective policy mixes covering a wider range of objectives and measures.</p>
<p>The Commissioner responsible for Industry and Entrepreneurship and the Commissioner responsible for Research and Innovation are leading work on an "Innovation Union" flagship initiative that will propose bold actions to tackle these issues in a comprehensive manner. This initiative is scheduled for adoption by the Commission soon, and the President of the Commission intends to present it to the European Council in December 2010. The Innovation Union initiative will put forward a full set of proposals to unblock the path from ideas to markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0428"></a>

<p>(EN) Climate change is indeed a top priority. Over recent years climate change has been increasingly incorporated into Framework Programme components. It comprises research contributing to 1) the understanding of the past, present and future climate system and its processes, 2) the quantification of climate impacts on humans and nature, 3) the identification and assessment of mitigation and adaptation options, and 4) the development of technologies and practices leading to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. During the first three years of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), climate change related research contracts have exceeded EUR 1.5 billion in EU contribution.</p>
<p>The positive trend of investing in climate change research is continuing with the calls for proposals published in July 2010. For the most concerned themes in the specific programmes "Cooperation" and "Capacities" of FP7, namely Environment (including climate change), Transport (including Aeronautics), Energy, Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Biotechnology and Research Infrastructures, the allocated overall budget in the calls concerned amount to about EUR 1.2 billion. Within the calls published in July 2010 approximately 55% of all topics announced under these themes are directly addressing climate change issues or have a climate change related component. Approximately two thirds of all these climate change topics call for innovation in approaches, methods, products, materials, equipments, models, etc. that will enhance the EU's capacity to tackle major societal challenges whilst raising its competitiveness. The final amount to be committed for climate change related research grants will only be possible to calculate after the end of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>This shows clearly the Commission's proactivity with regard to innovation related to climate change issues. Climate change and research on the development of a low-carbon society constitute an important part of the "Innovation Union Flagship Initiative" initially set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy on which the Commission will communicate further details shortly.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that the implementation of the Innovation Union initiative can strenghten the efforts that are already undertaken and planned in developing a low-carbon and climate resilient society;</p>
<p>As regards flooding events, climate change may increase the frequency and intensity of climate related hazards such as floods, and consequently will increase the vulnerability of natural and human systems. Research and technological development is essential to assess preventive approaches that could reduce flooding risks and prevent loss of human lives. Within the current call, research will contribute to building societal resilience to disasters in Europe and will complement running projects on flash floods risk management, on flood early warning and on flood management in cities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0434"></a>

<p>(EN) Regarding EU policies on food security, the Commission firstly refers to its Communication on food security adopted on 31 March 2010<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While proposing that the EU should address the four pillars of food security (availability of food, access to food, nutritional adequacy, crisis prevention and management), the Communication specifically proposes as a priority to "increase the support to demand-led agricultural research for development, extension and innovation, aiming to reach +50% by 2015".</p>
<p>The Food Security Thematic Programme has been successfully supporting research-related activities in its first phase (2007-2010). This goal will be pursued by the Commission in the second phase of the Food Security Thematic Programme (2011-2013).</p>
<p>This funding mainly comprises support for programmes of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which are implemented by the CGIAR's 15 centres and their implementing partners, and support to regional networks such as the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern, Southern and Central Africa (ASARECA) and the Conseil Ouest et Centre Africain pour la recherche et la Développement Agricole (CORAF). The regional networks work closely with the national agricultural research systems in their member states to implement regional research on crops, livestock, fisheries, biotechnologies and natural resources management in support of food security objectives.</p>
<p>Regarding international research cooperation with third countries, it should be noted that such cooperation is actively supported and encouraged in all the research areas of the EU Research Framework Programmes, with all topics being potentially open to cooperation with third countries.</p>
<p>In fact, since the beginning of the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7), several topics in each annual call addressing food production have targeted international cooperation with third countries, both industrialised and developing, with mandatory participation of third countries.</p>
<p>At a summit in Lisbon in 2007, high representatives from the EU and the African Union Commission (AUC) launched a Joint Cooperation Strategy. Subsequently, "Water and Food security" was selected as one of the "early deliverables" to be implemented in the 2010 Work Programme of FP7.</p>
<p>Following this, in 2010 the Commission published a cross-thematic call for Africa covering collaborative research in food and agriculture, environment and health, with a total budget of EUR 63 million.</p>
<p>The call was a major success and mobilised scientific communities in Africa and Europe. Participation went beyond expectations: 190 proposals were submitted (90 above the selection threshold) and 23 were retained for funding (currently under negotiation).</p>
<p>More specifically, 11 proposals were retained for funding in the area of food, agriculture and environment. All research activities involve African partners with the aim of strengthening Africa's research capacities. Selected projects will cover, amongst other issues, better drought warning, better water and soil management, sustainable nutrition research for Africa, conservation agriculture and the adoption of farmer led innovations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the increase of diabetes in the European population, and the major issue this represents for Europe, in terms of human suffering and economic costs and losses.</p>
<p>For this reason, diabetes ranks among the priority subjects for medical research at European level. The EU is currently investing EUR 170 million (32 projects) on diabetes research through the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007 – 2013). Furthermore, as part of its current call for proposals<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission has published four research topics on diabetes with the prospect of about a further EUR 63 million EU funding for diabetes research. This translates to about another ten EU-funded projects in diabetes research. Another major effort includes an EU partnership with the European Pharmaceutical Industry Association (EFPIA): through the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), EUR 54 million are being devoted to address the faster and safer development of therapeutic approaches in diabetes as a result of the first IMI Call for proposals. Furthermore, the IMI scientific priorities for 2010 include the development of personalized medicine approaches in diabetes.</p>
<p>This research investment addresses issues such as genetics and epidemiology, physiopathology, metabolism and integrative physiology, clinical trials, and micro-and macro-vascular complications. Further research on diabetes might become available in future calls for proposals.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the recommendations provided in the DIAMAP<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> report which by identifying current advances in the field, as well as further needs and gaps, will contribute to strengthening European research on diabetes and to developing a coherent European policy in this area.</p>
<p>The report highlights, amongst other issues, the need to reinforce coordination of research activities at national and European level. Member States involvement and support is essential to achieving this aim.</p>
<p>As a step in this direction and with a view to help overcoming the fragmentation of research activities, programmes and policies across Europe in this field, the Commission has published as part of its FP7-ERA-NET-2011-RTD<a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> call for proposals in the health area, an ERA-NET on diabetes prevention and treatment.

<p>(EN) Health and ageing are identified as challenges to be addressed by the flagship initiative “Innovation union” in the “Europe 2020” Communication<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission’s proposal for the implementation of this Innovation union is scheduled for adoption shortly. It will include a set of policy reforms and focused initiatives to address major challenges for society, which also correspond to major market opportunities for European companies.</p>
<p>It is planned that the strategy will define “Innovation Partnerships” aiming to address societal challenges. Innovation Partnerships will provide a framework for pooling resources and bringing together all key actors (public authorities, researchers and industry, both large companies and high tech innovative SMEs) as well as relevant policies and instruments, on both the supply as well as on the demand side, covering procurement, standardisation and regulation issues. Healthy and active ageing as well as raw materials are both candidate Innovation Partnerships.</p>
<p>Ageing, as well as healthy and active ageing and independent living of the elderly, is the subject of a set of EU policies, in particular public health, research, industry, information society and employment. For example, the Commission has recently proposed that 2012 be designated "European Year for Active Ageing". An Innovation Partnership on active and healthy ageing would strengthen all of these efforts and could contribute to ensuring their coherent implementation, while optimally exploiting the resources and activities at national and regional level.</p>
<p>The Commission has already launched some initiatives in the field of research and innovation to support current EU policies related to raw materials (namely, the Raw Materials Initiative) in line with the future Europe 2020 flagship initiatives on "Innovation Union", "Resource efficient Europe" and "An industrial policy for the globalisation era". A safe, economical and ecologically sound supply of raw materials is vital for society. This includes supply of primary as well as from recycling sources and the pursuit of alternative materials or processes. Hence, the current call for proposals under the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7) is a first set of actions in this direction. However, in addition to this research, innovative solutions are also needed, in particular on the demand side to promote recycling and on better cross-boarder cooperation (e.g. between geological surveys).</p>
<p>Under the Nanotechnologies, Materials and Production theme within FP7, calls for proposals addressing the resource efficiency and substitution of critical raw materials have already been launched, specifically with regard to:</p>
<p>networking at Member States' level on the industrial handling of raw materials;</p>
<p>developing new technologies for clean intelligent mining activities;</p>
<p>eco-design for new products and eco-efficient and cost-effective method of production, and finding substitutes for some high-tech critical raw materials.</p>
<p>Future actions within FP7 in the area could be decided when drafting the next years' annual work programme.</p>
<p>With regard to the next Framework Programme, the preliminary preparation work has not yet addressed individual areas for research. These issues will be considered in due course.</p>
<p>Raw materials is also an area where a proposal for an Innovation Partnership can be developed in future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In April 2010, the Commission adopted a Communication on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> proposing a whole set of measures, including gradual improvements but also profound changes requiring a revision of the legal basis of EU research and a re-balancing between trust and control and between risk-taking and risk-avoidance.</p>
<p>In the Communication, the elements of simplification are presented in three main strands. The first strand contains measures that can be implemented now, under the current legal framework, and for which many elements are already underway as part of a continuous process started with the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007-2013). These measures include the improvement of the guidance documents and support services for applicants, the development of user-friendly IT tools for submission of proposals and management of projects and a harmonisation of the interpretation and implementation of the rules across all Commission services. The second strand deals with changes to the rules but without leaving the current cost and input based system. This comprises e.g. a broader acceptance of average cost methods, lump sum options for owner-managers of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and a simpler treatment of interest on pre-financing. The third strand presents novel options for profound changes of the funding model towards an output-based approach using individual lump sums at the level of whole projects. These options are currently subject to discussions with the stakeholders, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>Simplification will be a key element for the preparation of the next Research Framework Programme. The Commission proposal for the next Research Framework Programme will also tackle the reduction of the general complexity of the EU research funding landscape with its multiplicity of intervention mechanisms, funding schemes and implementing bodies. The Innovation Union flagship initiative will require clarity of objectives and instruments, consistency and stability of rules and lightness and speed of administrative procedures and processes.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for the future Framework Programme will also tackle the reduction of the general complexity of the EU research funding landscape with its multiplicity of intervention mechanisms, funding schemes and implementing bodies. The European plan for research and innovation and the Innovation Union flagship initiative will require clarity of objectives and instruments, consistency and stability of rules and lightness and speed of administrative procedures and processes. In this context, simplification will be a key element for the preparation of the future Framework Programme.</p>
<p>A significant number of commercial organisations are meanwhile engaged in FP7 projects. In March 2010, over 7,000 distinct enterprises were participating, of which 4,350 are SMEs. In terms of percentage of the FP7 funding at the same date, 24% of the FP7 funding was allocated to these 7,000 enterprises.</p>
<p>As regards the creation of new companies, this is an essential element of the continuous societal and economic innovation process, driven by entrepreneurial spirit and market forces. While the Research Framework Programmes aim at supporting this process throughout Europe, the creation of new enterprises is not a dedicated objective of the programme and as such is not monitored. Useful indications have however been obtained through dedicated impact analysis studies. An example of such study is an analysis of the impact of FP5 projects (1998-2002) in the ICT area<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The study found that about 137 out of 1,000 respondents to a survey declared that participation in the Programme had "directly led to or however facilitated the creation of a spin-off company". Half of those were considered to be directly attributable to a particular project.</p>
<p>The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) facilitates the emergence and growth of new enterprises, in particular through financial instruments, business and innovation support services through the Enterprise Europe Network and the fostering of a business and innovation friendly environment through policy learning and cooperation on clusters and other themes. By the end of March 2010 about 68,000 SMEs had benefited from the CIP financial instruments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> indeed modified the regime for the provision of road freight cabotage operations. As from 14 May 2010, the provision of cabotage, i.e. of national carriage for hire or reward carried out on a temporary basis in a host Member State, must be linked to a previous international road transport of goods. Furthermore, the new regime contains clear and simple rules as regards the timeframe for the provision of cabotage operations. These new rules are set down in a regulation meaning that they are directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission is aware, the new cabotage rules as defined by Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 are generally appreciated by the haulage industry as they provide legal certainty, with lesser risk of being sanctioned for infringing the rules. They allow transport operators to better plan their international operations and offer them the opportunity to reduce the number of empty return runs. The Commission is not aware of differences in their implementation across Member States, but will of course monitor the situation and take whatever initiatives are appropriate if problems arise.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member also refers in her question to multi-modal transport. The conditions under which a multi-modal transport operation can be considered as combined transport are laid down in Directive 92/106/EEC<a href="#defann_12_3" name="refann_12_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. According to this Directive, for liberalised combined transport methods to result in a real reduction in road congestion, they should involve road journeys of limited distance. The liberalization of the initial and final sections of a combined transport operation applies to combined transport operations using sea routes provided that the sea journey represents a substantial part of the combined transport operation. Therefore, Directive 92/106/EEC provides that in order for a road transport operation to be considered as an initial or final leg of a combined road-sea transport operation, the maritime section of the combined transport needs to exceed 100 km and the distance between the port where the trailer is picked up and the final destination of the goods by road must not exceed 150 km. In this case, the initial or final road leg does not fall under the definition of "cabotage", and is therefore not subject to Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission should like first of all to reiterate that it attaches great importance to answering parliamentary questions, an important element of the democratic control exercised by Parliament. Nevertheless, the exponential increase in the number of parliamentary questions makes it very difficult to provide answers in good time, and requires a growing number of resources.</p>
<p>The human resources and the time needed to prepare, translate, and obtain the College’s approval of, draft answers depend on a large number of factors, including the need for different Commission services to work together, the immediate availability of information and the need for in-depth research of data. For these reasons, it is difficult to try to determine an average cost per question.</p>
<p>In general, one can say the following. At least one coordinator of parliamentary questions is appointed in every cabinet of the Members of the Commission. The Secretariat-General, which oversees the smooth functioning of the procedure and forwards the answer to Parliament, has an entire department, as well as a small number of IT officers responsible for developing and maintaining the computing tool used to manage parliamentary questions, at its disposal. Each Directorate-General comprises one or more officials who coordinate and help draft answers to parliamentary questions. In addition to these full-time members of staff, one should add the officials who draft or contribute on an ad hoc basis to the preparation of draft answers in each service and cabinet of the Commission, the officials of the Legal Service who revise each draft answer, and the translators assigned the task of translating the answer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0426"></a>

<p>Arsonists in Greece have trained their sights on the rare palm forest of Preveli at Rethymnon in Crete, 70% of which has burned to the ground. The area was the property of the monastery of Preveli, under the responsibility of government and the competent authorities. As again demonstrated in the Preveli case, protective and fire-fighting measures proved totally inadequate, resulting in widespread destruction. The laws enacted by the present PASOK government and the previous New Democracy government and the total inadequacy of forest fire-fighting resources make it easy for land-grabbers, and the big construction and real estate companies to change the use to which the land is put. The consequences for workers, residents and the natural environment in the area are disastrous. The pursuit of profit rides roughshod over the needs of the people and wreaks havoc on the environment.</p>

<p>(EN) In the absence of provisions for forestry in the EU Treaty, forest policy is the competence of the Member States. The Commission supports them through a range of instruments.</p>
<p>On the response side, Greece can benefit from support through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism established in 2001 to support and coordinate the deployment of Member States' in-kind assistance to disaster-stricken countries. In the past years Greece did request international assistance of heavy aerial means for forest fire-fighting through the Monitoring and Information Centre of the Commission and received immediate support from other Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has also repeatedly emphasised the importance of prevention. In February 2009, the Commission presented a Communication on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters, which proposes further work on a number of issues.</p>
<p>First, as requested by the Council Conclusions on a Community framework on disaster prevention within the EU, the Commission will before the end of 2010 develop EU guidelines taking into account work at national level on methods of hazard and risk mapping, assessment and analyses. Forest fires risk assessment approaches in a number of Member States will be studied specifically in this context.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission is launching a disaster prevention good practice programme which will lead to the adoption of EU guidelines on minimum standards for disaster prevention. Forest fires as well as other types of disasters related to extreme weather events will be important priorities of this work.</p>
<p>The EU rural development programmes can support forest fire prevention and forest restoration. For the period of 2007-2013, the Greek Rural Development Programme allocated approximately EUR 180 million (of which EUR 135 million come from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to measures aimed at forest fire prevention, prevention of soil erosion and flooding following fires, and also reforestation. The total geographical coverage of these measures is some 190,000 hectares.</p>
<p>The Commission runs the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS)<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which is used, inter alia, for forecasting fire risks and assessing damages caused by forest fires. It publishes a yearly report on forest fires in the Southern Member States which also serves as a basis for extensive exchanges between national authorities competent for forest fire management.</p>
<p>With regard to financial aid through the EU Solidarity Fund, there is only one eligibility criterion – damage must exceed a certain threshold established for each country based on its economic strength. Greece needs to present an application within 10 weeks of the first damage.</p>
<p>Looking to the longer term, the Commission's White Paper on climate change adaptation committed it to updating the EU forestry strategy on climate related aspects. Moreover, the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and forest information systems of 1 March 2010 launched a debate on options for an EU approach. The Council has already reached conclusions on this paper and Parliament's conclusions are eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>The Commission underlines the need for all Member States exposed to forest fire risks to put in place effective prevention and preparedness measures. The risk of forest fires can never be eliminated completely. But by working together we can do more to prevent, prepare and respond. The Commission is ready to support the Member States through all instruments at its disposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is looking to further economic relations with Turkmenistan through the signing of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA). In October 2008, the Turkmen President announced the creation of a Stabilisation Fund into which revenues from the country’s oil and gas exports would be paid. However, in the nearly two years since the announcement no information has been released about the Fund’s governance and it is highly probable, given Turkmenistan’s track record in this regard, that there will be no formal oversight arrangements. There is therefore a serious risk that future payments made by the EU into the Fund could be used for corrupt purposes. The Commission has stated that it aims to use the provision of technical assistance to Turkmenistan to promote good governance, including better and transparent hydrocarbon revenue management. Can the Commission state whether this assistance will address the governance problem concerning the Stabilisation Fund, and if so in what way, and will the Commission agree not to sign the PCA with Turkmenistan unless the international community sees a marked improvement in Turkmenistan’s management of its hydrocarbon revenues, including through the Stabilisation Fund?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for his question concerning the EU's relations with Turkmenistan and the Stabilisation Fund in Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member is no doubt aware, the EU has gradually re-established relations with Turkmenistan following the election of the President Berdymukhammedov in 2007. The EU-Turkmenistan Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters came into force on 1 August 2010. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which was signed in May 1998, is now awaiting ratification (including by the Parliament). Once the ratification process is completed, the EU will have a stronger framework in place for promoting its values and interests, including on sensitive matters.</p>
<p>While EU assistance for 2007-2010 was approximately EUR 30 million, it will grow to EUR 39 million for 2011-2013, the main focus being on education and legal reform, promotion of human rights, capacity building, sustainable development, rural development, and socio-economic reforms.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that one of the issues to be promoted through technical assistance is good governance, including better and transparent hydrocarbon revenue management in the country. However, the Commission is well aware that this is a long-term goal. Turkmenistan is undergoing a fragile process of economic diversification and political openness; certain key conditions are necessary for the country to meet the requirements of a fully transparent hydrocarbon revenue management such as good standards of corporate and public governance, as well as the existence of the civil society. Issue of transparency is indeed a governance issue of broader regional and international concern and it needs to be addressed as part of the reform and modernisation process. The Commission hopes that – with the more intensive EU-Turkmenistan dialogue and cooperation in the future – EU assistance in the field of good governance will bring desirable results in order to help Turkmenistan to meet international standards. Even though the EU does not contribute to the stabilisation fund, it will promote, through its technical assistance and political dialogue, to the principles of better and transparent hydrocarbon revenue management in the country, as it was mentioned above.</p>
<p>As regards the EU's cooperation with Turkmenistan in the field of energy, the Commission should clarify that this cooperation is at the very early stage. The EU signed a Memorandum of Understanding in the field of Energy with Turkmenistan in May 2008. This co-operation is broad in scope and ranges from promoting the diversification of energy supply routes, sustainable development of energy resources, exchange of policy, regulatory and technical know-how to the deployment and advancement of new energy sources, especially renewable energies.</p>
<p>It is clear that Turkmenistan can play an important role in helping the EU to diversify its energy supplies by contributing to the development of a southern energy corridor (including the Nabucco project). Dealing with these issues, the EU must keep a careful balance between securing the its interest in the energy field and pressing for political and democratic reforms in Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that its approach in relations with Turkmenistan is comprehensive and aims to establish a long-term, broad-based partnership, to the benefit of that country and Europe, and to all our citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0438"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the incident mentioned by the Honourable Member and follows closely all developments. The alleged main perpetrator has turned himself in to the police and is now under investigation by the Albanian judicial authorities. The Commission will be monitoring the processing of the case in conformity with the principles of human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing its Opinion on Albania's application for membership of the European Union. In this Opinion, which is due to be issued in November 2010 as part of the annual Enlargement package, the country's readiness for membership will be analysed, bearing in mind the "Copenhagen Criteria", in which respect for human rights and, specifically, the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities is of primary importance. All applicant countries are aware of the importance of fulfilling these criteria for progress towards the EU.</p>
<p>Consolidation of human rights and the rule of law is an important component of the ongoing political dialogue with the Albanian authorities. Furthermore, the EU, through its Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance, is providing development and technical assistance for strengthening institutions in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0446"></a>

<p>(EN) The use of human embryonic stem cells raises ethical questions, and there is no consensus in the EU whether the use of human embryonic stem cells should be permitted or not. Therefore, the Commission believes their use is best regulated at national level and that EU legislation should remain neutral in this regard.</p>
<p>Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> was revised on 8th September 2010<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The use of alternative, non-animal methods including the question on human embryonic stem cells was discussed at length during the negotiations leading to the adoption, and a solution to address these concerns was found and included in the new legislation. The new revised text respects fully the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>The revised Directive specifically leaves the decision on whether to allow their use for each individual Member State through Article 13(1) which states that: "Without prejudice to national legislation prohibiting certain types of methods, Member States shall ensure that a procedure is not carried out if another method or testing strategy for obtaining the result sought, not entailing the use of a live animal, is recognised under the legislation of the Union".</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this context it is important to note that there are currently no methods making use of human embryonic stem cells recognised by the legislation of the Union. Should such methods be developed and validated in the future, the decision on whether to include them in EU legislation rests with the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An epidemiological study by the University of Athens showing that cancer mortality rates for the inhabitants of Oinofyta for the period 1999-2009 are 14% higher than for elsewhere in the province of Viotia confirms the results of earlier studies and bears out complaints made by local inhabitants. The rise in the incidence of cancer (25% of deaths during the period concerned) is due to the strong presence of hexavalent chromium in the water in Oinofyta, with deaths from liver cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer in women and lung cancer all on the increase. Despite extensive and continuing protests on the part of local inhabitants and workers, Greek governments have taken no substantive measures to force industries to stop polluting the waters and the bed of the river Asopos, to repair the environmental damage and to clean up the region's water.</p>
<p>Will the Commission introduce more stringent limits on the presence of hexavalent chromium in drinking water? Does it continue to maintain that the risk posed by hexavalent chromium is similar to that from trivalent chromium, whereas it has been scientifically proven that hexavalent chromium compounds are among the most dangerous, causing three times as much damage because they are mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The question of the Honourable Member refers to industrial pollution by the substance hexavalent chromium in the municipality of Oinofyta (Boeotia prefecture, Greece), affecting the Asopos river and the quality of drinking water in the municipality. The Commission can provide the following information.</p>
<p>Relevant elements of EU environmental legislation are:</p>
<p>the Directive on Hazardous Waste<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, setting out obligations for adequate planning and management of hazardous waste;</p>
<p>the Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, setting out the environmental objective of 'good status' for all waters (rivers, lakes, groundwaters and coastal waters) as a rule by 2015, and to establish by 22 December 2009 the necessary plans and programmes to achieve the environmental objective, and; the Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_19_3" name="refann_19_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, setting quality standards for drinking water.</p>
<p>As for the management of hazardous waste, the Commission brought Greece before the European Court of Justice for improper implementation of waste legislation<a href="#defann_19_4" name="refann_19_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. In its judgment of 10 October 2009, the Court found that Greece has failed to fulfil its obligations under Directive 91/689/EEC, read in conjunction with Directives 2006/12/EC<a href="#defann_19_5" name="refann_19_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_19_6" name="refann_19_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. The Commission is currently scrutinising implementation of that judgment. According to the latest monitoring results, there are now no exceedances of the chromium limit values in drinking water within the municipality of Oinofyta; two borehole abstractions with values exceeding the limit values have been closed down, and a contract has been concluded with the Attiki Water Company, which now ensures the water supply of the municipality.</p>
<p>As for the Water Framework Directive, Greece has so far failed to establish the necessary plans and programmes to achieve good status for all water, and to notify these to the Commission by 22 March 2010. Consequently, the Commission has commenced an infringement procedure against Greece.</p>
<p>The Drinking Water Directive:</p>
<p>defines binding quality standards to be adhered to at the tap of the consumer;</p>
<p>sets out an obligation to regularly monitor drinking water quality; and</p>
<p>sets out an obligation to make available to consumers adequate and up-to-date information on the quality of their drinking water.</p>
<p>For a range of parameters, values are set at European level (Articles 4 and 5, annex I)<a href="#defann_19_7" name="refann_19_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. At the same time, the Directive in its Article 5(3) obliges Member States to set values for additional parameters not included in Annex I (e.g. hexavalent chromium) where the protection of human health within its national territory or part of it so requires.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities have, within their reporting obligations on water supply systems serving more than 5 000 persons for 2005-2007, so far not revealed a non-compliance with the quality standard for chromium (50 µg per litre), neither in the Boeotia prefecture nor in any other Greek prefecture. Smaller supplies serving less than 5 000 persons are not to be reported to the Commission; however the information of consumers is a binding obligation for these supply systems as well.</p>
<p>As regards a possible amendment of parameters and values, the Commission is currently considering a revision of the Drinking Water Directive, and will base its assessment on the latest scientific evidence, in particular the findings of the World Health Organisation<a href="#defann_19_8" name="refann_19_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
