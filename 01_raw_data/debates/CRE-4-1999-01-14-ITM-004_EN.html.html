But I am grateful to you for staying on. It is a very encouraging sign of the positive attitude of the Council presidency and the Council towards Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three points to make. First, I am very grateful that you went into considerable detail on the subject of eastward enlargement. As Parliament's rapporteur on eastward enlargement and internal security, I of course think that these are pivotal subjects. I have in mind not only the pre‐accession strategy and the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , but also a series of measures ranging from jointly combating crime to Europol's eastward extension, which can be anticipated by means of agreements with the police in the applicant countries. I also have in mind the vital area of education and training, which requires some restructuring of the PHARE programme, but it has been possible to achieve a great deal already.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also two long‐term objectives which I have mentioned in my report, and which I want to drawn your attention to. One is the protection of Europe's future external borders. I believe that we need to provide support measures to prepare for a common European border protection system, because I feel that we will need such a system in the long term. I would also point out that we have proposed a European academy for internal security. The Austrian Presidency was fairly receptive to this idea and I hope that you will seriously consider this project, which would be situated in the border area between the EU and the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I would like to mention the topic of burden sharing. We need an EU burden‐sharing system with quotas for civil war refugees and asylum seekers. The Austrian Presidency and the European Parliament have carried out some important preparatory work in this area too. We will judge this presidency by the progress it makes in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, without wishing to spark off any internal policy debate, I would ask you to defer the sensitive subjects of citizenship law and thus of EU citizenship law in the individual Member States ...</p>

It is increasingly clear that the Dublin Convention and the Schengen Agreement are contributing to the creation of a brutal and restrictive refugee policy in western Europe. We can already see the unreasonable effects of the Dublin Convention when the principle of the first asylum country is applied to countries which have different criteria for granting asylum. People are passed around between countries and their applications are not dealt with properly. We can see that one of the main real motives of the Schengen Agreement appears to be to use methods such as carrier liability, tough visa policies and excessive border controls to prevent asylum seekers from coming to the EU at all in order to be able to seek asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we can also see how this motion for a resolution defends the totally unreasonable document produced by the Austrian Presidency, which is one long attack on anything that represents a humane and responsible refugee policy. It is about ‘Fortress Europe'; it is no longer about taking responsibility for the asylum seekers.</p>

The aim of Schengen is to bring about the freedom of movement of persons in the EU. However, Schengen's rules are centred entirely on border controls, security controls and compensatory measures. What message does this send to our citizens? Only a few articles are concerned with the positive aspect of freedom of movement. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also fear and are very concerned that Schengen could lead to a less generous and humane policy on refugees and asylum. There are many things which point towards that. That is why we are insisting that the UN's conventions on refugees should apply in all situations, even in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Schengen also has to be compatible with the intergovernmental Nordic Passport Union, so that freedom of movement in Scandinavia can continue and develop as it has done for 40 years. It is therefore pleasing that the committee unanimously supports this.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Schengen's integration into the Treaty is concerned, the negotiations must be open and involve both the European Parliament and the national parliaments. Access to information and documents must be made easier so that both politicians and citizens are able to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens are of the opinion that the Schengen Convention should be revised and amended, having regard to the principle of subsidiarity, various important basic rights and the legal guarantees designed to protect our citizens" personal safety and integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the enormous demands which are being made on the applicant countries and their ability to meet the requirements concerning border controls, legislation and so on. We are therefore calling for flexibility, responsibility and understanding on the part of the EU for the serious problems which these countries are facing.</p>

On all the main points, I agree with the views expressed by my Swedish colleagues, Mr Sjöstedt and Mrs Lindholm. There are two trends in the two proposals we are considering which are decisive for our group, for me personally and for the movement I represent in Denmark. One is towards a strengthening of Parliament's power in these areas, which is taking place at the expense of the authority of our national parliaments, and the other is a drive towards integration and an almost imperialistic urge to dominate the world around us, not least Norway and Iceland. We must oppose the trend to communitarise criminal law and all other areas of law, including police cooperation – in other words, the transfer of the third pillar to the first. This is rash and ill considered. It is an alarming development which runs counter to national legal traditions, especially the Danish one, which I support.</p>

Our job is to assess the work done by the British and Austrian Presidencies. Both initially presented a realistic programme and announced improvements in cooperation with Parliament. In practice, however, things turned out somewhat differently. Neither the spirit nor the letter of the promises made to us has been honoured. Many of the decisions foreshadowed have been deferred, and in a number of areas unsatisfactory compromises have been reached. The most striking example of the European Union's laborious progress is probably the slow start that Europol has got off to.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one more point. Paragraph 1(2) of the version of the Van Lancker report that I have before me seems to suggest that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force a year ago – this must be one of those pre‐cessions the President‐in‐Office was talking about this morning!</p>

And I am also going to take a moment to mention the presence here of the Presidency‐in‐Office, as I believe it is important. We all know that this does not happen often, although it should be a regular occurrence, and I hope that we will continue to have a Council presence during our debates.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Nassauer report, I only want to say that it seems to me to be an excellent report and I agree with its contents.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the report on Schengen cooperation, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, as it is a very difficult subject. And I would thank him, in particular, for the way in which the vote unfolded in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the principles in the report are concerned, I must point out that neither the Schengen Agreement nor the Schengen Protocol establish a hierarchy between the values of liberty and security. Both of these must be respected together if Schengen is to meet the objectives for which it was created.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> is vague. However, it is not vague; it is evolutionary, as it is constantly changing. This is the way it must be and must continue. The Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> will continue to change right up until the last moment before it is incorporated at European Union level, and its Executive Committee will continue to do its job. As a result, we cannot criticise the fact that its evolution may be marked by a certain degree of vagueness.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Schengen represents a whole, and it must be incorporated into the Community <span class="italic">acquis </span> as a whole. It cannot be divided up for fear of losing this marvellous instrument that has already guaranteed us freedom of movement within a common area, which is what it was designed for. And I should like to give you an example of this. I have already mentioned that neither the SIS nor the Schengen Agreement establish a hierarchy of values between security and liberty and, with respect to the SIS specifically, a hierarchy cannot be established in terms of the importance of Article 96 or Article 95. We cannot say that it is more important to draw up the list of foreigners than the list on the admission of terrorists. That all forms part of a whole and must be incorporated as such.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elliott </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, regarding Mr Nassauer's report on police cooperation and the development of EUROPOL, I was very pleased with what we heard from the German presidency in relation to the development of EUROPOL in the context of the newly ratified convention. I agree entirely with what others have said here: if we are to see any significant further extension of EUROPOL into the operational sphere then we must ensure that there is a proper system of democratic accountability of its activity, involving an enhanced role for this Parliament, and indeed a proper system of independent complaints against any of its activities. This is essential, just as it is for any national police force.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, in this whole area of judicial and home affairs there is now an overwhelming need for extensive and rapid progress in harmonisation. The minimal progress we have made in this area, compared with the headlong progress we have made in the financial, economic and many other spheres of Community activity, is now causing serious problems. We need to do everything we possibly can to catch up in the areas of, for example, extradition, cross‐border crime, judicial and court cooperation, including civil matters as the German minister outlined, and legislation regarding nationality and citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you one example: I am dealing with the case of a family where the mother is Irish, the father British, and their daughter was born in Holland, but for the last eight years they have lived in Spain – very European. But this girl, who is now 13, has no nationality and only a temporary travel document issued as a concession by the Irish authorities. We must be able to deal properly with the situation of people in these circumstances and not allow a situation to develop where children can be virtually stateless. We must get to grips with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support Mrs van Lancker's report. It contains many excellent proposals. I am glad that the amendments adopted at committee removed some of the mild criticism of the British and Irish position which was agreed at Amsterdam as regards non‐participation, for a period at any rate, in the Schengen agreement. I am sure that as time moves on the situation will change. We need to be aware of the implications for the whole operation of the European Union of the fact that Schengen will contain two non‐EU Member States when Icelandic and Norwegian participation is confirmed. And the fact that two or three existing EU Member States will not be part of Schengen creates complications which will need to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was pleased at the references the minister made to the question of the applicant countries. The Committee on Civil Liberties has had a valuable meeting with parliamentarians from these applicant countries to discuss the whole judiciary and home affairs area. The influx of people seeking asylum from certain of these eastern European countries at the present time calls into question the situation in certain of these countries and makes it urgently necessary for them to introduce effective legislation to protect their ethnic minorities. I very much hope that in the ongoing negotiations Council and Commission will ensure that the issue of human rights and the protection of minorities is given the urgent priority it deserves.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Reding </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Treaty of Amsterdam improves the running of European policy on justice and home affairs. However, for five years at least, that policy, for example on asylum, is beyond all parliamentary control. National parliaments no longer have a say in the matter and the European Parliament"s rights are limited to consultation only. This is insufficient. It is unacceptable that such an important field as domestic security should be beyond parliamentary control and decision‐making and should not be a part of democratic transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the fact that important acts are adopted by the Council of Ministers, and then nothing happens. These texts, which are essential to the smooth running of the Union and to the security of our citizens, are not ratified and therefore cannot enter into force. Mr Nassauer"s report cites thirteen such texts, which are among the most important ones. This amounts to a denial of political efficiency, and to absolute opposition to change. In other words, in terms of the fight against crime, and asylum and immigration policy, we see a lot of declarations and few actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not questioning the good will of our leaders. I am quite simply stating the political reality, which is not very positive, and I strongly urge the Council to draw lessons from this negative situation and ensure that, the next time the Treaties are reviewed, the structures are changed, as the current shortcomings of the institutions are preventing us from doing good. Our citizens ask us to act, and often we want to but are unable to do so.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pirker </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we all agree that the Schengen security system is quite simply essential if we are to achieve freedom of movement. We should never forget that we can only enjoy freedom of movement if we continue to guarantee security for all our citizens, and if possible even increase it.</p>
<p class="contents">The facts demonstrate just how important the Schengen security system really is. I requested some figures which show that there are approximately 30 000 successful searches made each year, totalling around 120 000 searches by the end of 1998. That means that tonnes of drugs have been seized, thousands of stolen cars have been identified at the borders, weapons and stolen works of art have been seized, and thousands of illegal immigrant smugglers have been arrested, or, in the case of illegal immigrants, intercepted at the border. So Schengen has led to an improvement in security.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also proof that the Schengen security system, as already implemented by 10 Member States, is sound. I would go so far as to say that it is unique in the world, with 6 million data records on missing persons and stolen property, and controls at over 1 500 border crossing points.</p>
<p class="contents">So what further progress can we expect? I see the emphasis as being on three focal points, which I would like to single out. First, now that we have seen how well Schengen can function, and how important it is for achieving freedom of movement, we should implement the Schengen Agreement in all our Member States and thus improve security for all Europe's citizens. Second, we should offer more support to those Member States faced with tougher challenges, particularly in connection with migration, by means of help with border controls and also help with burden sharing. Third, we should use the Pre‐Accession Pact as a means of offering support to the applicant countries, as accession to the European Union is only possible if the security standards are met.</p>

There has been alarm over such issues as the easy transportation of drugs within the internal market, and spillage over the EU"s external borders, which we have had some grim reminders of, especially in signs of organised crime emanating from the east.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that Schengen is not yet a fully workable system. When the Treaty of Amsterdam takes effect it will bring with it important changes to the judicial status of the Schengen provisions, bringing them largely within the scope of the first pillar. For this reason, solving the Schengen problems and dispelling the doubts of ordinary citizens will demand action on the part of this year"s countries holding the presidency, Germany and Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">Security arrangements for travel within the Schengen zone may best be ensured through multi‐level cooperation, whose key elements will comprise rapid exchanges of information between national authorities, the work of Europol, and highly developed customs information systems. Because there will be no checks at borders within the zone, the so‐called system of invisible surveillance must be effective enough to ensure that the enormous benefit of freedom of movement is not abused by criminal organisations and tax evaders. There has to be a sustainable balance between citizens" freedoms and general considerations of security, a system that will maximise the advantages of free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent opinion polls Finns said they thought one of the most important tasks during Finland"s presidency would be the prevention of international crime. This must be borne in mind when this issue is next discussed at the summit in Tampere.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schily, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to thank those Members who have stressed in their speeches that Schengen is of course a two‐part system. On the one hand we grant our citizens the enormous privilege of freedom of movement, which clearly enhances their quality of life. However, this cannot be allowed to mean a loss of security, and that is why the second part is so vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree with what Mr Pirker said about what needs to be turned into reality. I mentioned in my report that Germany will be the first country to submit itself to a review under the Schengen Implementation Agreement. I also agree that we particularly need to help countries with special problems, as regards both burden‐sharing and support for applicant countries. Incidentally, we are not only doing that as part of our EU presidency, we are also trying to do this bilaterally, and in my capacity as Germany's Minister for the Interior, if you will allow me to mention this in passing, I am also holding various meetings with my colleagues from the applicant countries, with a view to progressing these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the comments I have to make now relate to speeches which we heard this morning, although I do not know if the Members present now were also here then. The situation here today is a rather unusual one. Various Members were not sure that the process of informing and involving the Parliament had been as good as it might be. I think it is fair to say that there has always been an effort to honour the necessary obligations, and the German Presidency will certainly do everything in its power to comply with your wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Schengen is concerned, I would like to point out that we are providing information in accordance with traditional practice, and that we will certainly continue this tradition. We are trying to do this in a wide range of forums. My State Secretary last November gave the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs a detailed report on the Schengen situation, covering both integration measures and the forthcoming work programme, and I will certainly be attending the committee in Brussels myself next week in my capacity as minister to report further.</p>
<p class="contents">As to whether reports could be improved further, as I said this morning we are happy to take up the suggestion of publishing a written report at the end of the presidency. I must, however, make it clear that we cannot synchronise publication of the report with the last Council meeting, it will have to be drawn up by the presidency. That is our intention, in any case. As the presidency, we will honour this undertaking to present a written report.</p>
<p class="contents">That would no doubt also considerably facilitate your work in the House. It will probably not be possible to present a report before the meetings, but I am more than willing to make an oral report after the formal Council meetings. So I think that we can accommodate each other. And with regard to the time‐limits mentioned earlier, the three‐month time limit has been adopted as the norm, and there is nothing we in our presidency capacity can do to alter that.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also asked if it is possible to judge whether Parliament's opinions have been sufficiently taken into account when decisions are adopted. I could carp and say that the recitals which precede such decisions are too general. But at the end of the day the position is no different to what you find in many other places: you can only really judge whether your ideas and suggestions have been taken on board or not by looking at the end result or the content of a decision. I think that it would hardly be feasible to record who had an idea first or presented it most forcefully, to acknowledge authorship, so to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">Many problems arise because the situation is neither one thing nor the other. Regarding the institutional deficit which various members touched upon, I do not dispute its existence, but I think we will have to cope with the situation as it stands. Furthermore, I would like to remind you that in March we have an interparliamentary conference which is intended to prepare the ground for the Tampere special summit. Given that there have been quite understandable complaints that adequate information on the action plan has not perhaps always been published in good time, then this would seem to be a good opportunity to reiterate comments made here in Parliament. I would also like to point out that the next special summit is to establish whether the action plan is to be reviewed in Tampere, and this will be on the agenda of the conference in March.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise once again that in 1998 Parliament was consulted 15 times and provided with information seven times on justice and home affairs matters, in the hope that some of the criticism expressed here could be tempered somewhat. Some of you suggested that you had not been provided with full information on the Schengen Information System. One Member asked if I could redress the balance with written information. I am very happy to do that, Mr Chanterie. As I have to adhere to the time limits that apply here, I hope you will forgive me for not going into full detail about the Schengen Information System.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is always possible to generalise, specific issues can be of vital importance in this field. If we weigh these various issues against each other, it emerges that there are certain fields in which national sovereignty plays an even greater part than in others. In such cases it is important to see that justice is done to the overall picture. We are certainly making an effort to arrange matters so that there is adequate democratic control, but I would say that our chances of achieving institutional reform within the six months mentioned here are not great.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, on behalf of the German Presidency, I can only assure you that we will be very glad to comply with our duty of information, and I accordingly look forward to successful cooperation.</p>
