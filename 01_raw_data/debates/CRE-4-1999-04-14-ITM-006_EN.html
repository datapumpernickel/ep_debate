In any event, we have already agreed that at the next part‐session there will be ten extra minutes to make up for the ten minutes we shall miss today because he has to leave at 6.50 p.m. for reasons outside his control.

<p class="contents">Question No 1 by <span class="bold">Patricia McKenna </span>(H−0222/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: European central banking and monetary system</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council indicate how it is proposed that new ‘Euro' currency will be regularly issued after the Member State currencies are replaced, and whether it will be by ‘Euro' bond issues to the commercial banks only, in effect incurring new debt in the system, or as free issue ‘Euro' currency, incurring no debt, or some combination of both, especially as a major declared intent of the system and associated convergence criteria and Stability Pact is debt reduction?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council inform Parliament as to which EU Member State central banks are fully privately owned, which ones are partly so, and which are fully publicly owned? Can it say if it regards it as proper that either party or fully privately owned central banks should be constituent parts of the European System of Central Banks, and even part owners of the European Central Bank, both established by the European Union Treaties, giving private financial interests some measure of control over the European monetary system, something potentially not conducive to the declared aim of monetary stability?</p>

At the same time they convert the major part of their outstanding public debts into euros, pursuant to Council Regulation No 974/98 of 3 May 1998. During the transitional period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001, private issuers can convert outstanding bonds into euros in accordance with that Council regulation. They can issue new bonds in euros. At the end of the transitional period, all new bonds issued by public and private issuers will be issued in euros or in foreign currencies. All outstanding debts issued in national currencies that then no longer exist can only be serviced and paid in euros from the year 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to Council Decision 317/98 of 3 May 1998, the central bank legislations of those Member States participating in European monetary union must comply with the EU Treaty provisions and ensure that the central banks of those Member States that take part in European monetary union are totally independent.</p>

Commercial banks multiply the money supply issued by at least 10 to 15 times, and this is the reason that states get into debt, i.e. so that banks can make these huge profits. Considering that this whole project was supposed to ensure a reduction or elimination of debt, I do not think that is going to do it – do you agree?</p>

The level of private debt and the level of public debt are two entirely different indicators of economic development. The level of public debt tends to be a more critical indicator while the level of private debt can reflect increasing investment activity. You must clearly distinguish between the two. But what we must concern ourselves with in this context is quite simply the question of from when these bonds will be issued in euros. I have answered that question.</p>

Given the importance of tourism for job creation and the dissemination of European culture and in view of the fact that the Council of Ministers for Tourism is constantly deferring adoption of the programme, will the Council say when the final adoption of the programme can be expected?

The European Union expects that to mean fair and correct treatment and also a public and constitutional trial before an independent court, access to the legal adviser of his choice and admission of international observers to the trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union once again emphasises its firm rejection of the death penalty. At the same time the European Union reaffirms its condemnation of all forms of terrorism. The legitimate fight against terrorism must be conducted on a basis of full respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic standards. Regarding the exclusion of the Kurdish Democratic Party from the elections, I am sure the honourable Member is aware that on 8 March 1999 the Turkish Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the public prosecutor"s application for a temporary injunction to ban this party from participating.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 4 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−0228/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Western Sahara</p>
<p class="contents">Like other colonised nations, the people of Western Sahara are entitled to self‐determination and independence, but Morocco, which for nearly 24 years has occupied Western Sahara in breach of the UN Charter and international law, stands in the way. It has hampered, delayed and blocked the UN peace plan. Nevertheless, the EU is giving Morocco substantial economic aid.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Council reconcile EU aid to Morocco with the latter's occupation of Western Sahara? How does the Council intend to further the implementation of the UN peace plan?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to the President‐in‐Office to answer Mrs Theorin's question.</p>

Developments have been followed closely by the Member States and through the activities in the United Nations. In the framework of the common foreign and security policy, the initiatives of the UN Secretary‐General have been considered repeatedly and on a regular basis, in particular in the CFSP working group responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 December 1998 the presidency made a statement on behalf of the European Union, unreservedly supporting the United Nations" efforts to find a fair and lasting solution. That is why the European Union noted with great interest the following decisions by the Moroccan Government. Firstly, it decided to formalise the status of the UNHCR in the region concerned. That should now make it possible to resume the pre‐registration activities in the Tindouf camps. We hope discussions will now begin with the UNHCR on the draft protocol on the return of the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the agreement on the status of the MINURSO troops is to be signed. This decision will permit the orderly and prompt deployment of the forces needed to implement the planned solution while at the same time simplifying the everyday implementation of MINURSO operations. From the European Union"s point of view there is therefore no reason to reconsider the EU aid to Morocco because of developments in Western Sahara.</p>

<p class="contents">The fundamental point to bear in mind is the length of time we have all been waiting for this referendum to get off the ground; the pressure on Morocco has been kept up for a long time now. Even though we are providing financial assistance, it would be interesting to hear whether the EU Council of Ministers is ready to lean on the Moroccan Government in an effort to prevent it from once again taking a decision on a referendum, only to postpone implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 160 000 people are living in various refugee camps, with almost as many soldiers to guard them. It therefore makes sense to ensure that this process is initiated in a right and proper way. I am keen to hear what the Council is willing to undertake.</p>

<p class="contents">The original question made some clear requests. Economic aid is a means of exerting pressure that we can understand, if you tell us that you want to use it, but you say that you do not. So what other means of pressure do you propose? Also, after all this vagueness – we are now seeing it with regard to Kosovo – the Council tells us that everything has been tried from a diplomatic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a few reasons to doubt this. What is your influence? We would really like to know. It is like the situation with Turkey: how do you manage to gain assurances and influence, by what means? We think that economic means are appropriate, but if there are other means you could explain them to us. After all, they are not state secrets.</p>

<p class="contents">As you are well aware, Mr Baker"s special envoy mediated between the Sahrawi people and the Moroccans with some success, although it is a shame that an American acted as mediator rather than a European. Nonetheless, we have been informed that Mr Charles Dunbar, Mr Baker"s special representative, has thrown in the towel. He has stated that he cannot tolerate the fact that Morocco constantly opposes the United Nation"s proposals to speed up the referendum on Western Sahara"s autonomy and to guarantee a fair referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">And to stress the question, do you not believe that it would be better if, rather than just supporting the referendum, the European Union were to make use of its positive influence on Morocco and call for a fair referendum – which the Sahrawi people are anxiously awaiting – in the next six months, which will be a crucial period? It is a shame that we have to labour this point, but it would be far worse if, in December, we had to regret the European Union"s lack of influence.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 5 by <span class="bold">Francisca Bennasar Tous </span>(H−0235/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Island regions in the new context of the Amsterdam Treaty</p>
<p class="contents">Article 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty sets out the Community's aim of reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, and Declaration 30 annexed to the said Treaty recognises that ‘island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their island status, the permanence of which impairs their economic and social development'. Bearing in mind that the additional costs involved in transporting people, goods and energy constitute one of the basic reasons for which island regions are unable to compete on the single market on an equal footing, and that Article 154 (ex Article 129B) refers explicitly to the need to link island regions with the central regions of the Community, what specific measures does the Council intend to take in order to ensure that island regions are properly integrated into the internal market on an equal footing?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 6 by <span class="bold">Roy Perry </span>(H−0241/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Interreg for islands</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council intend to support calls for a specific strand on inter‐island cooperation being included in the Interreg programme as requested by Parliament amendments at first reading to the Varela Suanzes‐Carpegna report on the European Regional Development Fund?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 7 by <span class="bold">Vincenzo Viola </span>(H−0246/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Integrated programme for EU island regions</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of Articles 154 and 158 of the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and Declaration 30 annexed to the latter Treaty, Commission DG XVII has drawn up a communication on the use of renewable energy in the EU's island regions. At an earlier stage, DG XII commissioned a study on research and technological development in island regions, and DG XI drafted a code of practice for island waste management. To date, and in spite of the explicit call by the EP, the plans concerned have not found practical expression in an integrated programme to aid the EU's island regions, home to 14 million citizens of 12 Member States, to enable them to compete on equal terms with mainland regions, which do not start out with the same intrinsic geographical handicap.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures will the Council take, not least in connection with Structural Fund reform and the Interreg Community initiative, with a view to giving effect to the provisions which it has itself laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 8 by <span class="bold">Konstantinos Hatzidakis </span>(H−0260/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Measures in support of the island regions of the Union</p>
<p class="contents">Article 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty states that one of the Union's commitments is to take measures to reduce the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands. Furthermore, Declaration No. 30 annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty recognises that the islands suffer from structural handicaps arising from their particular status as islands and calls on the Union to take account of those handicaps and, where necessary, to take specific measures in order to integrate those regions better into the internal market on fair conditions. Will the Council, therefore, say what preparatory measures it has taken to translate the provisions of Article 158 and Declaration No. 30 into practical projects and programmes once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force?</p>

One of the main aims of the reform of the Structural and Cohesion Funds in the framework of Agenda 2000 is to concentrate aid on the particularly needy and the poorest regions. In this regard the Council recognises that the task of regional policy is to develop all the existing potential in order to make up for structural imbalances and backwardness and to speed up economic and social change in the disadvantaged regions, including the islands. So we will continue to support the island regions in the next aid programme period too. Negotiations are currently still underway with the European Parliament on the exact formulation of the regulation on the European Regional Fund, which is especially important here, in the framework of the informal conciliation and legislative procedure. I have just come from a conciliation procedure on the subject and can describe the situation as it evolved just three‐quarters of an hour ago. It looks as though agreement could be reached relatively quickly between Parliament and the Council on the outstanding questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that the Commission recently stated that special attention must also be given to including the island regions in the measures under the Interreg C Community initiative. Without prejudice to the further procedure, I think that too seems useful.</p>

Article 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which forms the basis of the cohesion policy, was wrongly translated in some of the Union"s official languages. The only logical meaning of this article, thanks to the addenda introduced by the Amsterdam Council, is to consider all island regions of the Union as least favoured regions due to their geographical handicap, which is the reason for additional costs in the transport or energy sectors, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council has interpreted this article restrictively in its regulation on the ERDF by talking of least favoured islands. This definition is unclear. Is it based on criteria linked to economics, geography and remoteness? And, first and foremost, I should like to say that it is an erroneous definition as it is at odds with Declaration 30 that is annexed to the Treaty and also goes against common sense itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should a reference to least favoured islands have been included in the Amsterdam Treaty when, in fact, they were already included among the least favoured regions in the former article? Would it perhaps be because the Council wishes to add a new category of regions, namely all the island regions, to the least‐favoured regions of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">In the new regulations for the Structural Funds, why does the Council now not wish to adopt the position it held in Amsterdam in defence of the island regions?</p>

<p class="contents">As you are not an islander, I feel I must point out that islands are not just places for holidays, with sunshine and the sea. They are regions which, especially in winter, face special problems of isolation. This is a constant disadvantage for islands and affects them in many ways.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I want to make is that there are many Members in this Parliament who are concerned about these issues. You previously heard the debate in the advisory committee where I expressed the views of the European Parliament. Particular attention must be paid to islands, and what was decided in Amsterdam must be translated into practical action. Interreg is the first opportunity we have had to promote the interests of ultra‐peripheral and insular regions, and we would therefore like a commitment on the part of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to finish by asking the President‐in‐Office if a specific strategy for islands is being prepared in the Council. I imagine that the answer will be a negative one but I hope that something will be done in the future.</p>

As early as 14 April 1998, the European Council made a statement on the human rights situation in Sudan, pointing out that serious human rights violations are still being committed there. The EU calls for unconditional respect for human rights in all parts of Sudan and urges that human rights observers be stationed in Sudan. Moreover, the EU calls for international observers to be given unrestricted access to regions in which abductions, cases of slavery, slave trading or similar human rights violations are reported. The European Union submitted a draft resolution to the 55th Human Rights Commission in Geneva which specifically refers to the problem of slavery. The EU will continue in future to raise human rights questions with the Sudanese Government with the aim of changing the Sudanese Government"s attitude to slavery too. The European Union has already suspended its economic cooperation with Sudan, with the exception of humanitarian aid. The suspension of humanitarian aid would only harm the civilian population and is therefore not being considered as a possible means of exerting pressure on the Sudanese Government.</p>

The European Council stressed in particular that economic policy coordination needs to be deepened and strengthened in order to ensure the success of economic and monetary union and to support sustainable, employment‐promoting growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It took the view that the existing economic challenges demand an effective and coordinated response that encompasses budgetary, monetary and structural policy. Finally, the European Council requested the ECOFIN Council to report to it in Helsinki on the functioning of economic policy coordination in the third stage of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principles of the economic policy of the Member States and the Community for 1998/99 underline in a similar manner that the Member States" economic policies, especially their financial and their monetary policy which now comes under the sole responsibility of the Community, together with the structural reforms, should be consistent with each other and mutually supportive. The aim here is to achieve low inflation, accompanied by sustainable and employment‐promoting growth.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Rio Summit</p>
<p class="contents">Taking advantage of its institutional position, Parliament has been encouraging relations between the Union and the countries of Latin America. Over the past few years it has approved increases under the principal budget headings used to finance cooperation with the latter region. It has regularly attended both formal and informal summits of Union Heads of State or Government and meetings of the San José and Rio Group Ministerial Conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing the above points in mind, what arrangements has the Council Presidency‐in‐Office made to enable Parliament to take part in the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State or Government of the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, due to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June of this year?</p>

It is a question that is discussed at almost every trilogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and the result is always the same. The decision on the possible participation of Members of the European Parliament in the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, due to be held in Rio de Janeiro at the end of June 1999, will be guided by the procedure the Council decided on 30 October 1998. The Austrian Presidency explained this procedure to the European Parliament in the trilogue on 16 December 1998 and, as I said, it was also discussed at today"s trilogue.</p>
<p class="contents">This procedure dates back to the discussion of the question during the Strasbourg trilogue on 17 July 1998 between representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Accordingly, the Council will examine the request addressed to it by the President of the European Parliament on 11 March 1999, in other words it will consider whether Members of the European Parliament can participate on an individual basis.</p>

<p class="contents">This is now a recurring question as I put it to the presidency"s representative at the Conference of Delegation Chairmen. However, I should like to know if the German Presidency supports the idea of Parliament attending the summit since its feelings on the role Parliament should play in the process of European integration appear to differ from those expressed by Chancellor Schröder this morning. Parliament has already attended the Rio and San José Group Conferences and I should like to know if the Council believes that Parliament should have an active role, as is only natural. This is an important matter; we cannot be sure that no budget decisions that affect, or may affect, Parliament"s responsibilities will be taken during the forthcoming summit. What does the presidency think? Would it support Parliament"s active presence at the summit?</p>

The presidency cannot do otherwise; it has to adhere to the principles decided by the Council. It cannot give any undertakings beyond that. It does not have the power to do so. If anyone wants to go beyond that, then this question will have to be addressed during the process of institutional reform that is about to get underway. But let me say on behalf of the presidency that as a matter of principle we should be very careful not to confuse the different tasks, responsibilities and levels within the European Union. It must always remain clear which European Union institution is acting on the basis of which responsibility, so as to ensure the necessary transparency vis‐ŕ‐vis the people. The Council is against anything that would tend to confuse or blur the different responsibilities.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 15 by <span class="bold">Robin Teverson </span>(H−0248/99)</p>

<p class="contents">The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that residents of Gibraltar must have the right to vote in the European elections.

The Council would be very pleased if both states finally managed to reach agreement on it. The Council has not yet considered the possible consequences of that ruling. It attaches the utmost importance to the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament and, in this respect, to the implementation of the principle of elections by direct universal suffrage laid down in Article 138 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Any change to the act introducing the election by direct universal suffrage of the Members of the European Parliament would mean that the Council had to decide the appropriate provisions unanimously, with the assent of the European Parliament, and recommend to the Member States that they adopt them in line with their constitutional rules.

But it is also one of principle, not just of theoretical principle but of one that has been tested in the European Court of Human Rights, as my question points out. It was a judgment made, not by a small majority of judges in that body, but by a vote of 15 to 2, a very large majority, in favour of the principle that in terms of human rights, citizens of Gibraltar should be able to vote in European elections. So although I am disappointed that the President‐in‐Office of the Council looks for agreement between the two Member States, surely this is an area where the Council, out of concern for human rights and following the ruling of an institution not in the EU, but one which it respects and is included in part of the Amsterdam Treaty, should take positive steps? Will the Council take those positive steps to correct this lack of human rights?</p>

It has often come up during Question Time. Questions of this kind have been put very often and I must tell you quite honestly that your reply, namely that you could not provide any further information in response to further supplementaries, is very unsatisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned. Let me perhaps point out the following and ask you to take it further or even to provide some information if possible. We must always look at Gibraltar in terms of two different legal systems, because after all we know that Gibraltar"s existing borders do not correspond to its historical borders. That is to say, there is a part of Gibraltar that is undoubtedly part of Great Britain and another part, the northern part, which is, if you like, Spanish territory under British administration. So would it not be possible, for example, at least to grant the right to vote to those people who live in the Spanish territory that comes under British administration? Surely at least that should be possible!</p>

<p class="contents">The purpose of that meeting, of which the media were informed, was to evaluate these incidents in the participating states. In particular, the exchange of information covered the nature of the rallies organised by the PKK and the number of people who took part in the demonstrations in the various countries. No decisions were taken, since this was not a meeting of the Council of the European Union. It was simply agreed to improve the exchange of information with a view to any future such incidents.</p>

Why was this meeting of the Ministers for the Interior kept secret? Where is the transparency that is supposed to be pervading the European Union ‘grazing"? Why must this be hidden from the people of the European Union, from the people it wants to get close to? Mr President, there is no answer to this.</p>
<p class="contents">What did they decide? What did they discuss? Were the discussions only about the PKK? Did they put it on trial, did they pass sentence on it and did they place it under special supervision? Or were the discussions about other organisations that are active within the European Union? Are we perhaps at the beginning of, or already witnessing, the same measures that Hitler and the Gestapo implemented against the Communists, the Jews, followed by the Social Democrats and finally all Democrats? Is the European Union perhaps being submerged by a wave of McCarthyism? Is that why you are hiding all this from us, so that you can take decisions in secret, and so that you can outlaw demonstrations against the war and other demonstrations, just as the Belgian Government did in Brussels recently?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like an answer. Perhaps the President‐in‐Office is once again demonstrating his powerlessness. If that is the case, we are extremely dissatisfied that a President‐in‐Office who is incapable of giving an answer is appearing before us.</p>

It is the case in all Member States of the European Union and in all constitutional states that those responsible for internal security naturally do not hold sensitive talks, relating for instance to intelligence gathering, in public. There would be no point at all in this kind of meeting if the details were made public. I do not believe the situation is any different in any Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am happy to respond to your call for transparency and mention at least one point that was discussed and where there is no particular need for confidentiality. It is that the conference expressed regret that Greece did not immediately inform its European Union partners when Öcalan was arrested by Kenyan security forces and taken to Turkey.</p>
