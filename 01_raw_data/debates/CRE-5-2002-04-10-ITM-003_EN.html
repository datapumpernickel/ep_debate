<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graça Moura (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="bold"><span class="italic"></span></span><span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first idea I wish to get across is that relations between the European Union and China are continuing to develop favourably, although not always at an even pace or at the desired speed. In any event, the Commission communication on the development of a comprehensive partnership with China, presented to the Council and Parliament half way through last year, outlines a strategy and incorporates a set of principles, aims and methods which are wholly commendable, and it seems, incidentally, that China’s reaction to some – although not all – of the aspects this communication deals with is positive. Similarly, the support that the People’s Republic of China has so readily provided for the international fight against terrorism is evidence of an attitude that we should note and applaud.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have seen China become a member of the WTO, which opens up considerable prospects for that country to play an even more significant role on the international stage. There is a range of issues that have been on the table for a long time: the role of China in the Far East, its relations with the ASEM countries and other parts of Asia, its internal political situation and its political, trade and cultural relations with the European Union. In this framework, we are still seeing a certain disparity between the various methods of cooperation already in place and the development, which we consider to be desirable, of areas related to the political situation, the establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights. It could, nevertheless, be said that there are already signs, here and there, which give reason to believe that these things will gradually be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The experiences of Hong Kong and Macao, in particular, show that it is possible to ensure that these developments take place at the political, social, economic and cultural levels. We must, therefore, deepen cooperation and dialogue whilst continuing to insist on the other objectives that go beyond the framework of economic relations and which could even, in some cases, have a harmful effect on them unless the People’s Republic of China finds a satisfactory solution to certain issues that we consider to be fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the problems that require closer attention are raised in the specific chapters of the report. These are: China’s entry to the WTO, the need for sustainable development, for better coordination between the strand of economic progress and the strands of political and social progress, concerns about the problems of employment that will ensue from China’s accession to the WTO and the need for the gradual conversion and modernisation of its economy, respect for the interests of its neighbouring countries, the need for environmental protection, the advantage of stepping up cultural exchange, particularly at university level, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Our range of concerns about relations with Taiwan also falls into this category. The European Union’s recognition of the ‘one China’ principle cannot, under any circumstances, lead us to accept solutions involving force. We all feel that there is no real alternative to dialogue on this matter, as difficult as this may prove to be. Furthermore, we feel obliged to express our concern about Tibet, with regard to which it is also becoming necessary and urgent to pursue dialogue with a view to defining a new and real statute of full autonomy, with the only exceptions being foreign and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, whilst acknowledging that China seems to be making a degree of progress in the field of human rights, it should be understood that a vast area in which the situation is far from satisfactory is still wide open and this Parliament must, therefore, make this absolutely clear. These points are covered in some detail in the report which I have had the honour of drafting and I shall, therefore, not go into them now.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Mr President, a complex framework with countless positive possibilities is opening up for closer relations and cooperation between the European Union and China, but it also still contains countless problems that must be addressed frankly and an acceptable solution must be reached on the basis of democratic standards that will lead to the establishment of the rule of law, to the strengthening of civil society and to human rights being fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 22 amendments that have been tabled, I should like to make the following brief observation: some, which simply replicate the contents of the text, should not be accepted, and there are also some amendments whose thrust would be more appropriate in a report on Hong Kong, which is why I am rejecting them at the present time. Lastly, there are other amendments, dealing either with the taxonomy of the text or with improving it, which I have accepted. To conclude, Mr President, I am convinced that, by voting for this report, this House will be making both an institutional and a political contribution to the strategy drawn up by the Commission for the development of a comprehensive partnership between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China is a very important trading partner for the EU, not least for my own country, Finland. Nokia, for example, already employs more than 4 000 staff in the manufacture of mobile phones. It is important that China joined the WTO at the Doha meeting. It is important for the outside world, but still more for China, which must clarify many of its laws and its rules over the next few years to be able to implement all the requirements for membership. WTO membership will also lead to social and political pressures in China. How China is to solve these problems fairly is of course an internal matter but I agree with the rapporteur that in the longer term programmes jointly implemented in cooperation with the EU, Japan and the United States of America will be desirable to solve the employment and social problems of the country’s vast rural area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in our interest and that of the world as a whole that China should be a stable, open and prosperous society which we will support if and when it moves further towards democracy and a free market economy and embraces the principles of human rights and the rule of law. We are pleased to welcome China’s involvement in the international effort against terrorism and the rapprochement between China and India. I believe that the values we hold to be important here in Parliament – democracy, the rule of law, human rights, equality and pluralism – will also gain ground in China if we maintain a vitally interactive relationship and encourage China to open up in all respects and permit its citizens to enjoy the freedom of modern communications media and allow them the right to become unionised and freely express their opinions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank him most sincerely for the draft resolution presented in plenary. Moreover, the draft has received almost unanimous support from the relevant committee. I have been a member of the delegation for relations with the People´s Republic of China since 1986, and I believe it is fair to say that this is the most balanced text ever presented in plenary on the issue. Were the Socialist Group’s amendments to be included, it would indeed be almost perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">I have absolutely no doubt that, along with the introduction of the euro and enlargement of the European Union, the development of China will be remembered as one of the four or five milestones in the history of the world in the twenty-first century. Hence the importance I attach to relations between China and the European Union. I could comment on a great many issues, but I shall focus on just a few points in the interests of saving time and bearing in mind that other members of my group will be taking the floor. I will start from the premise that in our culture drawing a friend’s attention to his or her shortcomings is not considered to be interference. On the contrary, we believe it is a friend’s duty to do so. I have endeavoured to explain this to our Chinese partners on numerous occasions. For example, we speak out against the death penalty wherever it is in force, whether it be in the United States or in China. Nonetheless, we consider both these countries to be our friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it must be a sign of the times that the Chinese authorities have responded favourably to the Commission communication on which the report is based. All the Union’s institutions agree that it is in China’s own interest, not just in that of the European Union, for the People’s Republic to become stable and prosperous and move towards democracy. This must go beyond holding municipal elections with more than a single candidate per post.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to promote exchanges of all kinds. Those of us unfortunate enough to have the experience of living under a dictatorship for many years realise that isolation tended to strengthen the dictator’s position instead of helping democrats striving to overthrow them. Accession to the World Trade Organisation is a challenge the Chinese Government has been brave enough to rise to. It will involve risks and will have untold repercussions within and without the country. In the short term, it has already caused restructuring and large-scale lay-offs in certain sectors of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the major area of human rights, China still has a long way to go, in our view. Under-development is no excuse here. A moratorium on execution of the sentence on those already condemned to death must be achieved, prior to pressing for the elimination of these sentences. We have received very many well-founded allegations of torture. Torture must be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcomed a delegation from Tibet a few weeks ago, and feel that was a positive step. They provided some useful information, but many questions remain unanswered. The Chinese authorities should therefore be urged to pursue their recent policy of freeing Tibetan political prisoners. These are moves in the right direction, and are bound to benefit China and relations between China and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China is in all respects becoming a more and more important player on the world stage, and that also applies in the combating of terrorism where we must appreciate China’s active support for this serious struggle. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wants to see a democratic China that respects the principles of a free market, human rights and the rule of law. We also want China to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. There is no reason why these criteria should be confined to applying only within the borders of Europe. The ELDR Group has tabled a list of amendments, all designed to tighten up the report a little. The most important issue for us in this context is the One China policy. We are all familiar with this, and we know why it exists. As liberals, we are not proud of the One China policy, because it impedes development in a country that respects democracy, social pluralism and constitutional principles – namely Taiwan. The ELDR Group believes that the will and desires of Taiwan must be respected and that the China policy is an obstacle to their being so. We also believe that the European Parliament is the right place from which to send this signal, and it is therefore up to our governments to follow our advice. Last year, the President of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, was awarded the Liberal International Freedom Prize. Unfortunately, no EU country would also give him a visa so that he himself could collect it. His wife instead collected it, here in this House in November. Nonetheless, we should like to express our dissatisfaction with the fact that the Member States do not comply with their obligations to respect the President of Taiwan’s basic right to travel freely. The Olympic Games are to be held in China in 2008. That decision has been taken and is not to be altered, but let us take this opportunity to demand that China use this opportunity to demonstrate that it will comply with all the international standards and conventions relating to human rights. Recently, China has employed a practice whereby children born in mainland China are separated from their parents in Hong Kong. That is an infringement of human rights that is very much to be censured, and we will therefore demand that the Chinese Government stop this practice immediately and begin reunifying families so that parents in Hong Kong can be together with their children. I would again thank Mr Graça Moura for a thorough and well-considered report which aims at a more effective EU policy on the China issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, there are continuing protests by workers about the fact that at least 25 million jobs have disappeared in state-owned companies as a result of liberalisation and privatisation. In the old industrial areas in northern China, unemployment is estimated at 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">In a study concerning the risk of instability in China, the Conflict Prevention Network observes that, if China’s Communist Party does not manage to guarantee provision for the increasing number of poor and unemployed at a time when others in the population are becoming rich, the party’s ideological legitimacy may begin to be called into question. Things could then become unsettled in China.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of a series of reforms, grassroots democracy has not seriously taken root. China’s leadership is in a race against time, according to the CPN report which also observes that this is creating a dilemma for the EU. Is the EU to support a repressive regime because it maintains stability or is the risk of instability to be incurred through promoting citizens’ rights?</p>
<p class="contents">For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, there is an obvious answer to this question. Citizens’ rights and democracy must be promoted in all circumstances. The Beijing Government must fulfil its promise and initiate talks with the Dalai Lama. It is also necessary to continue the normalisation process with Taiwan without a show of arms, and China must comply with the content of the UN Conventions on Human Rights which have been signed. It is not therefore acceptable for people to be imprisoned because of their religious convictions or ethnic affiliations or because they wish to form a trade union or political party.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, something is perhaps in the process of happening. The latest issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review reports that there is a relaxation of the rules governing mass demonstrations under way. A policeman has even had a letter published stating that the right to demonstrate is written into China’s constitution and that it needs therefore to become easier to obtain permission to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="contents">The CPN report says that the EU must be cautious in attempting to influence China. Certainly we can be cautious. However, that presupposes a constructive response from China in which the latter implements the conventions it has signed and in which Chinese representatives do not interpret each friendly criticism as undue interference in China’s internal affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whenever the Union's relations with the People's Republic of China are assessed, economic interests are always to the fore. This is certainly understandable; after all, a market of around 1.3 billion people promises absolutely inexhaustible profits for those companies and banks active in it. China's accession to the WTO will further improve the terms for capital recovery. It will also intensify competition between Pacific economic powerhouses like Japan, Taiwan and the United States on the one hand and the EU and its Member States on the other. Everyone wants as large a slice as possible of this huge cake.</p>
<p class="contents">This is accompanied by constant reproaches from the political side that China should have more respect for human rights. These overlook or underestimate the fact that China is trying to complement the economic reforms, which have been underway for years, with federal democratic structures, social security systems and economic regulatory mechanisms. In acceding to the WTO, China is continuing this process. Nevertheless, nobody should be under the illusion that this separation of the State and the economy will solve China's immense social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The much lauded market of global capitalism is – whether you like it or not – amoral and not a suitable vehicle for translating basic values such as social justice and solidarity into action. It is and remains the state which is called upon here. There is no other government in the world that bears responsibility for 1.3 billion people. Seeking to establish a multilateral dialogue with China is all well and good, but in so doing nobody should put China under pressure or only have their own interests in mind. Anyone who does put pressure on China should keep a sense of proportion, carry out a realistic assessment of their own potential to meet the same demands and have a clear idea in advance of the effects that it might have. A dialogue is only meaningful and successful if a consensus is sought in the interests of all parties. This also applies to the death penalty. It is right to call for it to be abolished, but we should be just as consistent in calling for it to be abolished in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with China are more than ever before of strategic political significance. Uni-dimensional development, as is currently happening on China's doorstep as a result of the USA's strategic intentions, would not be very beneficial. Instability would be the result. As the EU enlarges, indeed precisely as it undergoes this process of enlargement, it is called upon to oppose any unilateral attempts to accumulate power, and to maintain and – if necessary – establish and consolidate stability by cultivating a balanced relationship with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Relations of the EU and its Member States with China are increasingly improving and being extended.</p>
<p class="contents">These are, in themselves, promising signs. However, the Commission and the rapporteur will agree with me that quite a few difficulties have to be overcome before mention can be made of a true spring breakthrough. Compliance with human rights, in particular, leaves a great deal to be desired. Reports of torture, maiming and even killings are too systematic to be ignored. Various groups in Chinese society are suffering such human rights violations, including, for example, non-registered Christians. According to a reliable report issued by various NGOs, their persecution has, in recent years, even been ordered at a high level in the Chinese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this persecution is hardly given any attention in the report by Mr Graça Moura, I have tabled a few additional amendments in this respect which I hope will find backing in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s response so far to these abuses is, in my view, very disappointing. According to the Commission document on China, ten rounds of political dialogue have already been held. At the same time, the Commission realises that there is still a yawning gap between action and international standards. Should we then not conclude that the ‘critical dialogue’ is inadequate as an instrument? And would it not be preferable by far to link economic interests to China’s observation of human rights much more than is now the case? The critical dialogue should not be there to ease our conscience, while we in the meantime keep a keen eye on our own economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">This will probably cost us something, but surely we should be prepared to go ahead nevertheless if human rights are so important to us. We in the European Union cannot conceive of spring if in China itself it is still the middle of winter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
