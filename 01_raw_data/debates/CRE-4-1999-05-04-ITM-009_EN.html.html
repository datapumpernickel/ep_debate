Of course everyone is in group meetings discussing the Statute, and that is where I should be now too. So please tell me what I should do.

Having my target audience absent really makes this rather difficult. So, I shall just grind out my speech, like it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, acting Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening and this morning we discussed the reforms that a new Commission needs to tackle as a matter of urgency. We formulated conditions that both individual Commissioners and the Commission collectively should fulfil, not just in terms of substance, but also as regards procedure. I hope and indeed I am confident that the vitality of this debate will also infect this House. The European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for the year 2000 provide us with an opportunity to do this, and as rapporteur I would like to make a brief introduction to the debate – assuming there will be one, that is. I believe that the influence wielded by political institutions is not just a matter of legal clauses and treaty articles. As parliamentarians we are particularly aware that political subject matter is only as good as the scope for communicating it through the process of public debate. So we will have to ensure that the new powers conferred on us by the Treaty of Amsterdam a few days ago are underpinned by our collective credibility. That is our true political capital. The first of the two central themes that I would like to see governing the future administrative development of the House is therefore ‘greater trust based on greater transparency'.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament would be a crucial step in this direction. In the expectation that a decision to this effect will be taken this year, the Budgets Committee has therefore included an amount of EUR 60 million in the reserve and has created a staff reserve to cover the additional administrative requirements expected. This means we can finally dispense with special pots of money such as the two special pension funds for Members, which have repeatedly been the subject of public criticism of Parliament. Furthermore, it is worth remembering at this point that the amount originally earmarked for setting up a supermarket, EUR 3.8 million, is no longer included in the preliminary estimates. Another relevant point in this context is that the repayment period for the new buildings has now been definitively set at 10 years instead of 15, so that the interest burden over the whole period has been reduced by some EUR 60 million, thus avoiding the need for a hidden loan from future budgets. I feel that this sends the right signals if we are to regain the confidence of the electorate. The target of not spending more than 20 % of the entire administrative expenditure category for the Parliament is one which we ourselves have observed for years, and the Budgets Committee believes, as do I, that this target must definitely be respected. A one‐off overshoot is only tolerable if the Statute for Members is budgetised, but it should be partly reduced towards the previous level in the coming year and return to that level in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, improvements in Parliament's administrative efficiency are both necessary and achievable. If we are to exploit the scope for greater efficiency, we need less bureaucracy and more decentralisation – in short an improvement in motivation by delegating more responsibility, including to those at middle management level. So it is now a question of actively implementing – both in the House and within the groups – the budgetisation system on which the Budgets Committee has already held a hearing. I am delighted that the administration has assured us that the additional tasks it will have to take on because of the Amsterdam Treaty coming into force and preparations for enlargement will be totally covered by the existing staff complement. We can do this only in cooperation with the staff, and we would not want it any other way. That is why the Budgets Committee has fundamentally signed up to the new staff policy, the centrepiece of which is promotion on the basis of sustained merit, with an average promotion cycle of five years.</p>
<p class="contents">For the coming budget year, this means that the decision taken to completely clear the promotion backlog will lead to upgradings for 26.5 % of staff with scope for promotion. Furthermore, this system will help to put a stop to the practice of party‐political or nationally motivated promotions through several grades at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by addressing several systemic problems that I have encountered under the budget procedure to date. A problem that I have come across in relation to <span class="italic">ad personam</span> promotions is that I as rapporteur am supposed to approve individual promotions which I assume are justified, but for which I cannot really take responsibility. I therefore propose that there should be a system for <span class="italic">ad personam</span> promotions, for example by means of an annual budget including all long‐term costs. Another problem, as I see it, is that the short period which rapporteurs have to acquaint themselves with the subject matter is scarcely adequate to grasp the complex interrelated issues within the administration. From a purely informational point of view, the annual reporting process is too weak in relation to the administration. And one last point: I am firmly convinced – and I have to say that my views have moved on in this respect – that we need more efficient simultaneous self‐regulation by the House itself, particularly in relation to the Bureau. This includes both budgetary and staff policy debates and a new system of Bureau rulings and political control of this. But the golden rule for Parliament is still ‘greater trust leads to greater transparency'.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wynn </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I thank Mrs Müller for her contribution. I am glad she did not just put it in writing. As the Socialist coordinator let me say that the group will be supporting the report as it stands with the amendment from the Committee on Budgets which was voted on last night concerning the extra upgradings for the <span class="italic">ad personams</span> . Having said that, I have discharged my duty as the coordinator.</p>
<p class="contents">As there are so few people here and whilst very few people are concerned about the debate, I shall concentrate on two points on which I will speak in a personal capacity. The first is on paragraph 1 where we mention the need for a Members' statute and an assistants' statute. Our group wants a Members' statute and an assistants' statute. I want a Members' statute. I am fed up with everybody thinking I am some sort of crook. I want the clarification to be such that my expenses are paid from Parliament, are audited, are accounted and that no one can point the finger at me.</p>
<p class="contents">Because I have that attitude when we look at what is being called for, nothing will happen until we get the statutes. It is pretty obvious from the discussions I have heard over the last two days that the Members' Statute will be an ongoing discussion for the next few weeks, if not the next few months. Having said that, we could actually take two courses of action which would help us considerably and would be a sign of good faith to the Council to show that we are serious. There is nothing to stop this Parliament as from 20 July having assistants paid directly by Parliament, rather than being paid by the Members. We could do that. We could have the safeguards on redundancy payments and we could have the safeguards on pension contributions from Parliament rather than Members being responsible for it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other proposal which the Council has been asking for, namely the audits of our general office allowances, there is no reason why on 20 July, if we do not have an agreement on the Members' Statute we should not say there will be an annual audit of the general office allowance which must be submitted to Parliament, carried out by <span class="italic">bona fide</span> auditors and must be submitted to Parliament for Members to receive their annual allowance. We could do those two things without the Members' Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">On the final paragraphs where we talk about the cost of the buildings and the total budgetary amounts, we are almost up to EUR 1 billion for Parliament's budget. If you look at those figures that works out at about EUR 1.5m for each Member. When the press sees that figure I am sure it will make a lot of it. But of course we cannot be compared to national parliaments. They do not have interpretation and translation costs. National parliaments do not work in three places of work. National parliaments are not buying their buildings like we are or renting a variety of buildings. So that figure can be somewhat misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">The one thing about these figures is that we have to look for prudence. We cannot just call on the other institutions to tighten their belts. We have to look at every available opportunity to save money. One of my pet hobby‐horses is the two sessions we are now bound to have in October in Strasbourg. Much as I love Strasbourg, coming here twice in October for two five‐day sessions is a waste of our time and energy. There is no reason why we could not have two sessions in Strasbourg – one being of three days and one of two days within the same week. If we did that we would save a considerable amount of money.</p>

It is a good report in my view and its content is entirely relevant. Reports are always better received if they are presented by the rapporteurs themselves, and even more so in Edith"s case.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, Madam President, this is a good document which I shall broadly support. What is more, the report"s content seems entirely logical, given that a Parliament that intends to take on bigger responsibilities certainly needs to grow in terms of telecommunications, computing and personnel. At present, only the Council seems to believe it is possible to broaden and deepen the European Union by making budget cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the most striking aspect of the report is the issue of promotions, particularly since it talks about 490 promotions when in recent years there have been an average of 150. However, what we need to do here is to listen, just as we have listened, to the administration and to look at how it has changed and how staff policy will change further still, that is, how staff are managed in this House. I therefore think that this new system of promotions based on sustained merit and not solely on the availability of a particular job will be of benefit to Parliament. I therefore fully support this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to promotions, and more specifically paragraph 2, which contains a reference to them, Mr Filippi and myself intend to table an amendment which, further to accepting the 490 promotions, also supports those permanent and temporary jobs that have already been accepted, as well as the three <span class="italic">ad personam</span> promotions.</p>

I would just like to raise one issue, which relates to the European Ombudsman"s budget. This is a new institution, which was created only in 1995. However, it has proved to be both a much‐needed and viable arrangement. The problem is simply a lack of resources. The number of staff employed in this office, in proportion to the number of cases they have to deal with, is considerably smaller than that in their counterparts in the Member States. The problem is made even worse by the fact that the staff required need to be exceptionally well qualified, and for that reason they are difficult to recruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Up till now, Parliament has reacted reasonably favourably to the proposals of the Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, for addressing the most urgent staffing problems. This has to be acknowledged, although our reactions have been helped along by the fact that the funding required has not been on a very large scale. However, improvements should be allowed to continue. Now that the new interinstitutional agreement has been reached, financial resources are quite limited, but nevertheless the number of staff working in this institution should be increased. I hope that there can be a systematic increase in resources made available to the European Ombudsman in the budget proper, as that is the way we can best promote the public"s confidence in the work of the EU generally.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Samland </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgets. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, well, those of you who are still here, I think that as we are amongst experts, there are only a few key points to make about the budget for Parliament for the year 2000. First, we are deciding on a budget which takes us into the next millennium. This will be the first year of the new millennium, and a new Parliament will of course have to implement this budget. We will also have a new Commission. And this budget may also be based on a new interinstitutional agreement. That brings us to the first and most important point.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not accept the interinstitutional agreement this Thursday, that is if we cannot summon up 314 votes for it, then the additional EUR 155 million provided for Category 5 will not be available. That would mean that the additional 20 % which would in turn be available to the European Parliament from the EUR 155 million would not after all be available. As a consequence, with continuing expenditure we would exceed the 20 % ceiling. In other words, we would not be able to keep expenditure within the 20 % limit. This is simply one more argument for Members to vote in favour on Thursday, if we do not want also to cut back our activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we have taken a very major step in staff policy. The Secretary‐General is sitting next to you, Madam President, and my comments now are addressed to him. The decision we have taken in committee and recommended to Parliament involves promoting around 20 % of all staff with scope for promotion. This is an enormous step, and as I said at the beginning of this debate, I cannot help feeling – as we were in a situation of deadlock – that there is always a wave of promotions in the year when one Parliament steps down and the next is elected.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussion that we had with him during the conciliation procedure and also in the committee itself, the Secretary‐General assured us that this was the start of a new staff policy, under which quality and not the passport you hold would be the key to promotion. I have no way of monitoring this, but I would urge those Members who return to the House to watch very carefully that the measure that we have agreed to as a concession continues to be observed over the next few years. I am confident that the Secretary‐General will continue to adhere to the undertaking he has given us in future, with the new Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that by virtue of a Bureau decision we have upgraded the 60 posts for ushers, including those here in the Chamber, from Category D to Category C, in four stages. This follows on consistently from the steps we have already taken in recent years. I would also like to be very explicit about the buildings – these comments are addressed to you, Madam President, and to the Bureau. We have expressed our willingness to retrospectively implement the <span class="italic">ad personam </span> promotions resulting from Mrs Müller's amendment, on condition that the Bureau respects its undertaking to finance the buildings within a ten‐year period.</p>
<p class="contents">The corrected Berlin decision means that all the prerequisites for this are in place. I am asking you too to respect this promise – just as we have done one our side – by honouring the <span class="italic">ad personam</span> promotions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final and very personal comment. I believe that a parliament that wishes to be equal to the tasks demanded of it, and this applies all the more so following the Treaty of Amsterdam, needs to have an employment structure for assistants that allows it to do full justice to these tasks. Over the last ten years, since 1989, I have been one of the people who have secured a more than 100 % increase in the flat‐rate allowance for assistants. I stand by this, as I believe that good and well qualified academic assistants are essential if a Member who takes his work seriously is to carry out his duties to the full. I would therefore recommend that the new Parliament should return to this subject, as things have been at a standstill for two years now while we have been dealing with other issues, but we must come back to this point if our assistants are to work well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Laurila </span> <span class="bold">(PPE). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Madam President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Müller for an excellent report, the contents of which I entirely endorse. Considering that the European Parliament aspires to purge the European Union of abuses as a responsible wielder of budgetary power, I personally have problems with the fact that the European Parliament is promoting 490 of its officials in the year 2000. That number is three times what it was for this year, for example. It would be easy to put things in black and white and state that I cannot approve of these promotions. When, however, I listened to the report of Mr Priestley, Secretary‐General of the European Parliament, in the Committee on Budgets, I had to admit that things were the same as ever: knowledge breeds problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself know that over the period 1995‐1996, when I worked here in Parliament, the practice and bases for promotion were not always fair. For that reason, I believe that we have to be able to correct distortions in staff promotion, especially as Mr Priestley has assured us that this will be a one‐off occasion used to correct distortions and that in the future we will follow established practice and fully comply with the rules that promotion is to be based solely on qualifications and ability, rules which maintain the principle of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Our role in the European Parliament is to keep to a tight budget for ourselves as well. Our role is to ensure that there is transparency. I hope that Mr Priestley will find a way to keep MEPs informed about progress made in positive administrative reforms.</p>
