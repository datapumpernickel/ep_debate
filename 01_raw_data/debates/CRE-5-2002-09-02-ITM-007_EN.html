It is also the day that the new Director-General of the World Trade Organisation takes office. Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi is the first Director-General from a developing country. We wish him well and also acknowledge with thanks the hard work done by Mr Mike Moore, the departing Director-General.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves of the United Nations Secretary-General's report on globalisation to the Millennium Assembly. He said that inclusive globalisation must be built on the great enabling force of the market and market forces alone will not achieve it. It requires a broader effort to create a shared future based on our common humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is an attempt to bring the Secretary-General's hopes into a legislative framework here in the European Parliament. It is trade, not aid, that will eliminate world poverty and accelerate sustainable development. It is trade, not aid, in partnership with the global business community that will increase industrial, intellectual, educational and infrastructural capacities in developing countries and repeat what is now called the Asian miracle, which I am told is alive and well in China. It is trade, not aid, that will drive the solutions to food security, clean water, housing, sanitation and information technology through foreign direct and inward investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past 50 years, world trade has increased 19-fold. Production has more than quadrupled and world per capita income has doubled. But unfortunately the human development report shows that the spread of technology, trade and wealth has not been equal, with the world's richest nations accounting for 20% of the world's population but 86% of the world's GDP, 82% of exports, 68% of foreign direct investment and 93% of Internet users. 64 countries are categorised in this group but the biggest proportion of the world's people are in the medium development category, including India, China and Indonesia and so on. These people are having severe structural, infrastructural, environmental and population problems. There are 51 chronically low-income countries, mainly in Africa but also in Asia and Central America, which depend entirely on aid because there is very little direct foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to look at the world as it is, not the way we think the world should be. In the world as it is, the combined gross national product of 182 developing countries is less than the global turnover of the top 200 of the largest multinational companies, the transnational corporations, of which there are 65 000 in all. There are 200 chairmen of transnational corporations whose combined turnover is bigger than the combined GNPs of presidents and finance ministers of 182 countries, encompassing probably the largest population groups in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">But my report proposes that the people who are running these huge multinational corporations are brought into the development process, first by encouraging them to accept good governance and corporate social responsibility as enunciated by the United Nations Secretary-General. We must create a framework in which the European Parliament, members of national parliaments and the directors of these companies can come together in a forum regularly, twice a year, with the rotating presidency of the EU to discuss matters of development and sustainability, not once in a blue moon as in Johannesburg or in Rio, but in a continuous dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this, I have proposed in my report that they set up something called an ethical investment committee on the lines of remuneration committees and other committees in boards of directors. The committee's job would be to identify development investment, investment as offset investments in developing countries. About 0.7% of their turnover in that country would go into investment projects to build intellectual, educational and infrastructural capacity in developing countries. That way everybody gains: the company because it gets a more skilled labour force and the country because it improves its capacity. I hope that Parliament will approve my proposal unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">May I thank the many people who have helped me with this report and express the hope that it will be passed tomorrow without any dissension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is timely because of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which is taking place at this moment in Johannesburg. It should also be seen in the context of the commitments made at the Doha Ministerial Conference last November and the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development last March.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also timely as negotiations on economic partnership agreements will be launched with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States at the end of this month. The European Union, as the largest trade bloc in the world and the largest source of foreign direct investment and official development assistance, has an important role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the Union's imports from developing countries have been rising by 15% per year over the past seven years. This is much faster than the imports from other countries. At the same time, I am aware that many developing countries, particularly the least-developed countries, have not fully shared in this growth. Much more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution and Mr Deva's report are broad in scope – and rightly so. The Commission welcomes the overall thrust of the analysis and recommendations. Indeed, while there is no doubt that trade can potentially contribute to development, poverty eradication and food security, the actual contribution depends on enabling policies and institutions being in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission will pay close attention to honouring the negotiating commitments made towards the developing countries in Doha. The Doha development agenda will address the improvement of market access, new trade rules that take into account the needs of developing countries and the further mainstreaming of trade matters into development and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As to access, and the area of agriculture which is of particular interest to many developing countries, the Doha Declaration states that 'Building on the work carried out to date and without prejudging the outcome of negotiations we commit ourselves to comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.'</p>
<p class="contents">For non-agricultural products, the Doha Declaration foresees: '... negotiations which shall aim ... to reduce or as appropriate eliminate tariffs, including the reduction or elimination of tariff peaks, high tariffs and tariff escalation, as well as non-tariff barriers, in particular on products of export interest to developing countries.'</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, this is an ambitious negotiating agenda, but one of great relevance for developing countries. As regards rule-making, several subjects of great importance for developing countries will be covered: intellectual property, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, competition, trade facilitation, government procurement and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions applying to regional trade agreements are another subject of negotiation. These negotiations will need to take into account the developmental aspects of regional trade agreements. Furthermore, the provisions for special and differential treatment in favour of developing countries will be reviewed with a view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the Doha negotiations will make a great contribution towards making the multilateral trading system and its rules more development-friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the third aspect – mainstreaming trade in development cooperation – the European Union has already made important progress over the past few years. The Community's development policy, based on the Commission's communication of April 2000, identified trade as one of six priorities for its development assistance. I would also like to draw your attention to the Commission's communication in February of this year on a global partnership for sustainable development. Furthermore the Commission is at present working on a communication on trade and development, which will describe how mainstreaming trade should go well beyond technical assistance and embrace capacity building, training, institutional support, the preparation of fiscal reform and assistance for adjustment on the supply side.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of civil society and the private sector, including large corporations, which figures prominently in Mr Deva's report, is also essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that over the past years around EUR 640 million were allocated by the Union for trade-related assistance, of which about 61% went to the ACP Group, 14% to Latin America and 12% to the Mediterranean. For the current ACP programming exercise for the ninth EDF, between 40 and 50% of the regional indicative programmes – EUR 280 to 350 million – is earmarked for trade-related assistance in the broad sense. In addition, up to EUR 50 million have been pledged for new programmes with ACP-wide scope. The Union is also the main provider of funds for the Global Trust Fund created for technical assistance provided by the World Trade Organisation in support of the Doha development agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, regional integration is very much part and parcel of a strategy of opening the economy and taking advantage of trading opportunities. Regional integration initiatives among developing countries, South-South integration, can contribute to their effective integration into the global economy and to the multilateral system, provided that they are outwardly oriented and lead to lower external barriers. Therefore the Union is committed to continuing its support for realistic South-South integration. At the same time it is stepping up its efforts to use North-South integration to stimulate deeper and more effective integration within the South. This approach should be reflected in the economic partnership agreements between ACP regional groupings and the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the industrial countries, the European Union took a lead last year with the Everything But Arms initiative. All exports from the least-developed countries, except arms, can enter the EU market without restriction. Only for three products – rice, sugar and bananas – is there a transition period. The benefits of this initiative for the least-developed countries would be greatly enhanced if the other industrial countries, as well as the larger trading nations among the developing countries, were to make a similar gesture.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that Mr Deva's report makes a constructive and far-reaching contribution in helping to define strategies to allow developing countries to take advantage of trade and globalisation in order to attain the fundamental development objectives of poverty eradication and food security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can benefit from this analysis and assessment during the forthcoming multilateral and regional negotiations. A regular dialogue on this with Parliament is most welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of countries classed as ‘least developed’ has increased, while the scale of poverty has continued to be huge in a number of countries with a high growth rate. The relationships between trade, development and poverty are complex, then, and we must avoid hasty judgments. My report to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which was adopted unanimously, contains proposals on this subject, some of which have been included in the Deva report. I will just focus on two main issues here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, aid, particularly technical assistance, is a key issue. There is very little information available on this subject but there appear to be a wealth of horror stories. What is essential is that the countries concerned can define their needs and communicate them to international agencies, setting themselves objectives and pursuing them. That is where our support is needed, and we must ensure that civil society and companies in the field participate as widely as possible. We must break with the practice of setting biased conditions which, in actual fact, serve the interests of the dominant countries. Aid must serve principally to create local diversified supply capacity. Any trade administration must be established at the level of regional common markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also requires the WTO to negotiate social measures to give vulnerable peoples new prospects in the face of the impact of liberalisation. Moreover, it calls for the issue of migrant workers to be included in the negotiations on services. Lastly, it calls for aid to offset losses from customs receipts in the least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report considers that the place of anti-poverty objectives at the very heart of unilateral trade rules still needs to be defined. I fear that the Commission may be frankly sceptical about Special and Differentiated Treatment. Not so us: we call for it to be redefined.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards future negotiations on investment, they may prove to be fruitful, but we would warn that direct investments very seldom reach the poorest countries and, when they do, it is in return for tax favours which harm these countries first of all. Without cooperation between the WTO and the other major bodies, without combating financial fragility, it is unlikely that the negotiations on investment will produce fruitful results for all those who are afflicted by poverty in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fernández Martín (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by saying that my feelings about this debate are bittersweet. On the one hand, Mr Deva has defended this own-initiative report which he has worked on for a long time with great dedication and taking up many interesting contributions. I would particularly like to highlight the consultations he has held with all the governments of the developing countries in order to hear their opinions and suggestions, in particular what these countries expect from the Millennium Round. The result is this report, which comes with the unanimous backing of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to be voted on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">But allow me, Mr President, to mention the less pleasant aspect of the issue. In the recitals, the rapporteur mentions more than twenty documents, resolutions and international agreements of recent years which demand more decisive action to fight poverty and the list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="contents">22 years have passed since Willy Brandt presented his impressive report on North-South relations. Since then, things have only got worse. We know about the examples of success, but unfortunately there are many, many more cases which show that, after decades of persistent growth, this world has never been less egalitarian; never has the distribution of wealth been as uneven as it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we cannot continue merely to make proposals, even if they are as interesting as those made today by Mr Deva. The problem of poverty throughout the world – including Europe – is not economic; it is a political problem, which requires political and global solutions. It is pointless to seek the people responsible, as is currently happening in Johannesburg. We do not have guilty and innocent parties here, just victims. And all the rest of us are guilty to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial resources approved in Monterrey, which have been mentioned by the representative of the Commission, represent a step forward, but everyone agrees that they are insufficient. The international organisations cannot continue to be the guardians of orthodoxy while one country after another falls victim to crises, not just in Africa, but also in Central America, South America and in other regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder why the representatives of the European countries, which constitute a majority in the International Monetary Fund, are not able to opt for new formulas which speed up the development of the poorest countries and those countries which are becoming poorer as a result of bad government and corruption. The regional economic blocs, apart from our own European Union, are not living through good times. We only need think about Mercosur or the Andean Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be tougher in our demands for progress in the direction set in Doha, in order to bring about greater openness in the markets, which will stimulate world trade. We must apply pressure in order that those who have resources may contribute more of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has mentioned the data relating to the European Union, which are certainly the most important data given for development aid in the world. But the trend is not satisfactory, Commissioner. Official development aid in the European Union has been decreasing over recent years. Therefore, the data are as you say, but the trend illustrated by the current data is not acceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must promote and stimulate more democracy and the development of human rights, of health, of food and of education for all. Also, and above all, in the developing countries. We must fight aggressively against corruption in all its forms, which exists without doubt in the least developed countries, but which also exists – and this is more reprehensible – amongst us.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree very much with Mr Deva’s comments on the greater involvement and co-responsibility of the large multinational corporations, but I must say that many of these leave much to be desired, and that their actions now move in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the essential elements if we are to shed light where there is only gloom (to recall Conrad), but let us demand more action, more decisions and fewer words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Glenys (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, thank you and congratulations to Mr Deva for a very wide-ranging and comprehensive report. It is, as Commissioner Byrne said, appropriate that we are here just as those long and arduous deliberations are taking place in Johannesburg. But perhaps more important and appropriate for us is the fact that the economic partnership agreement negotiations will begin this month. They have a wide-ranging agenda in Johannesburg, just as we have here.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that there are agreed goals in place and we now need all audacious and principled people to get down to working out how we meet the challenges: the challenges presented by the needless deaths of 11 million children under five every year; how we feed eight hundred million people who still go hungry; the 2.4 billion who have no adequate sanitation and the six million people we are losing every year to AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid is essential, as Mr Deva says, for developing countries, but trade will bring benefits on a far greater scale. If sub-Saharan Africa had just one percent more of the global export market, it would bring in an extra USD 70 billion each year. That is five times what the region now receives in aid and debt relief combined.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course poor countries need more aid, but they also need better and fairer export opportunities. The great thing about trade is that it brings self-reliance; trade brings opportunities for jobs and for investments. Trade also provides that ladder out of poverty which is what our committee and this report are all about.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing inevitable about all the concerns raised in Mr Deva's report. It is not written on tablets of stone that global politics and global policies should be about 'them' and 'us' and about the survival of the fittest in an unequal world, as President Mbeki said when opening the summit in Johannesburg. We must take into account too the impact of the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank and the conditionalities which they impose upon developing countries and which actually make their trading possibilities more difficult. What we need to say is that all the global actors on the global stage need a fair and comparable opportunity to perform well.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade barriers hurt poor people in general and women in particular, since it is these groups of poor people who tend to produce the goods that are most affected: agricultural goods and labour-intensive manufactured goods. As this report suggests, we clearly need a radical shake-up of world trade rules. What we see now is untenable; the unfairness and the inequity have to be tackled and trade is the key to doing this. Certainly in terms of the ACP-EU negotiations, we have a real opportunity to be centre stage and to be offering that equity and fairness. We are an agricultural superpower and we can lead in the whole post-Doha agenda by opening markets and by ending the dumping of what we produce on to the world market, thereby producing distortions which developing countries simply cannot deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">On TRIPS, the EU should maintain a strong and determined leadership. TRIPS must be implemented fairly. The issue of compulsory licensing must be resolved. Returning to the EPA negotiations, we should use the Doha Declaration on TRIPS as a ceiling for any discussion with the ACP on intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as Co-President of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I think that we have a very serious role to play in the EU's negotiations. We are saying very clearly in the Joint Assembly that we want a strong and unequivocal dimension, which is a development dimension. This will require a huge investment in building capacity and a serious analysis of the implications of the impact of reciprocity on our ACP partners.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as Mr Deva makes clear, we have a long 'to do' list – a list which will not be dealt with unless we confront the vested interests that benefit from the plight of the poor. Europe has to be driven by the moral imperatives which we face. It is time, as Mr Deva suggests, to challenge the orthodoxies and abandon the prescriptive notion that free flows of finance and information and trade advance welfare in all cases. It is time not for defeatist language but for constructive and practical answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been working in developing countries for some twenty years myself, and I have to admit in all honesty that I have yet to discover how exactly one goes about developing a country. What works in one country does not in another. That is my conclusion in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Deva himself refers to eastern Asia, which has experienced a tremendous economic upturn. What strikes me is that this development has taken place without any major development aid, and that this took place when most markets in the world were still closed. How is this possible, and why does this not work elsewhere? As Mr Fernández Martín has already pointed out, the report, in my view, does not sufficiently highlight the fact that sound development requires sound government, and certainly not a corrupt government. Unfortunately, I come across these far too often in most countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has tabled a few amendments at second reading. These amendments pertain to the following points. Firstly, we feel it is exaggerated to ban all exports of insecticides that are banned in Europe. Locust plagues in Africa can only be treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, unless something new has come on the market in the last year, of which I am not aware. This is how it has always been.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also exaggerated, in our view, to prescribe the same food safety requirements in Europe as in the developing countries. Needless to say, we will not be exporting any meat that is contaminated with dioxin or BSE. But food is in short supply and – as we say in Dutch – hunger is the best sauce. We will therefore need to make the necessary adjustments. I do want to confirm that our group is completely behind the Doha Declaration, and I am pleased that the Commission has reiterated this.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, the resolution does not mention the importance of a good price for agricultural products. As far as trade is concerned, I do not know whether Mr Deva has read the article in <span class="italic">The Economist </span>a few weeks ago, which clearly stated that the trade barriers among the developing countries are much higher than those with the rich countries. He partly refers to this in the resolution, but this should, to my mind, be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be perfect if we could blame the use of guns and pistols on those who manufacture them, but it seems a little idealistic to me. We regret that none of the amendments tabled by our group were adopted because there happen to be new rules. This is one of the reasons why my group will largely be abstaining from the vote on this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boudjenah (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, there is nothing indecent about stating the figures on extreme poverty in developing countries. What is indecent is the wilful blind eye turned by rich countries, who, despite the horror of the situation, still carry on in the same way. It is in this context that the increasing overlap between business and development should be viewed, including here, within the Committee on Development and Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">If the fight against poverty and food insecurity is to succeed, it cannot be left up to the business community. It must attack the structural causes of poverty in developing countries. Priority must be given to structural change in their economies in order to increase their share of products produced and diversified, including in the agricultural sector. That is why it is essential to promote fair access to land, water and the resources of biodiversity as well as a policy of local support for agricultural smallholdings. In order to achieve this, we must take account of three factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, new international commitments are needed and, most of all, must be honoured. I have just come from Johannesburg. After the disappointing Monterrey and Food Summits, Johannesburg is a new opportunity for the northern Heads of State to repeat how important it is to help the people of the South but also to provide ourselves with the proper means to do so. All well and good, but when will these significant commitments be followed up by practical action?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the approach concerning multilateral trade relations should definitely be thoroughly reviewed. Within the WTO, these relations do not actually take place with a view to achieving the priorities set by the United Nations, but are dominated by the ‘give-and-take’ philosophy. What is more, the negotiation methods and pace automatically exclude many developing countries. Why refuse the protection that has enabled developing countries to implement their own industrialisation? As for the ADPIC agreements, these restrict access for local peoples in the South to their own natural resources and are incompatible with the objective of food security. Moreover, pressure in favour of the liberalisation of services endangers their public services, such as water, energy, communications, health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, new funding must be found urgently. In Johannesburg, the French President, Jacques Chirac, suggested taking a small percentage of the wealth created by globalisation to finance the fight against its negative effects. Who is he trying to kid? Why not suggest that the rich countries set aside the equivalent of 5% of the money they spend on subsidies for their own agriculture in order to fight hunger in developing countries? Johannesburg, in particular, is also an excellent reflection of people’s experiences and anger, but also the hopes of the numerous NGOs, associations, men and women from all continents who meet to find alternatives and draw up effective proposals. We must listen to them. To Mr Berlusconi, who said in July that it is not the fault of rich countries if they have 80% of the world’s wealth, I would say that three quarters of the world are slowly dying on the doorstep of this so-called ‘rich’ world. It is the responsibility and duty of rich countries, for the sake of fairness as well as of economic efficiency, not to limit themselves to formal commitments, voluntary guidelines or the business community, but to define a proper, restrictive code of conduct that penalises countries which fail to give the necessary aid to the poorest countries. The same applies to transnational corporations, whose exceptional power must be regulated and controlled as a matter of urgency. Although the Deva report does not demonstrate a radical will to throw off the shackles of die-hard commercial globalisation, it still raises the need to protect the economies of poor countries and cancel all or part of the debt. This is a significant starting point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has shown considerable goodwill towards the various political groups in incorporating the possibilities put forward by each one. The result, as we can see, is that the balance between the various chapters is uneven. All in all, however, I think the report provides a starting point on some important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The chapter on food security, for example, is extremely promising, particularly where it says that ‘the fight against poverty and food insecurity must incorporate an attack on the structural causes of poverty’. It is poverty that is often the cause of malnutrition, and even famine in the worst cases. Clearly, attacking the structural causes is definitely the most intelligent approach. To date, however, it has often been thought that it was enough to open up the markets of rich countries to the products of poor countries, which I believe is only a partial solution – and then not even in every case – and that agricultural productivity in these countries needed to be increased. This does not take account of the fact that unless the poorest people are guaranteed access to land, they will still not have enough food.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider the approach of promoting access to land, water and the resources of biodiversity to be a good one, just as I consider the promotion of support for agricultural smallholdings to be a good approach. The discontinuation of export subsidies – and this is a black mark against us and against the United States – which disrupt local markets, and the cancellation of the debt which swallows up more than 40% of the GNP of the least developed countries, should also be applied in structural terms. So, those are a few proposals we should support.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is the acknowledgement of the fact that access to food must be recognised as a fundamental human right. This is essential, as it means that trade rules cannot affect the exercise of this right, which is the case today. To put it plainly, we need to challenge the hierarchy of rules which means that the WTO takes precedence over everything else, and therefore over all the international conventions designed to protect fundamental goods such as water and biodiversity, not to mention access to these fundamental goods.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that all this is positive and, although I do not share the same enthusiasm for Mr Deva’s proposals with regard to the role of multinationals, I believe that overall I will be able to support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It prevents poor farmers from earning their own income by exporting to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report <span class="italic">‘The Great EU Sugar Scam’</span>, published last week, Oxfam International shows how Europe's subsidies undermine local African sugar sales. Despite pleas from Parliament and the Commission to abolish these subsidies in 2002, the European sugar lobbyists managed to persuade their governments to extend the protectionism to 2009. This to me is theft at the expense of the poorest of the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, such embarrassing practices are a central theme at the World Summit in Johannesburg, and the European Union should therefore use that forum to call for fair trade, the abolition of unfair subsidies and the opening up of our rich markets. That is what sustainable development is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Bush administration, the United States has drawn up its own Farm Bill, completely in contravention of the agreements reached at Doha as part of negotiations on the worldwide abolition of agricultural subsidies. This attempt to win the goodwill of the voters is a direct attack on the world's poorest, unfortunately with grave consequences for world trade and worldwide development.</p>
<p class="contents">Luckily, the Commission and Parliament are choosing a different route. All credit is due to the Commission, which, via Mr Lamy in Doha and Mr Fischler, wants to make a U-turn through agricultural reform proposals. It is time to move towards a shift from production aid to agricultural policy. More environmental agriculture, the abolition of export subsidies and the strict enforcement of food security rules – that is what sustainable development is about.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Commission to help the EU Member States to send out this signal at the World Summit and to help bring about an agreement on fair trade and fair agriculture in Johannesburg accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is not prepared to bring these issues in Johannesburg to a concrete resolution is standing by the poverty issue empty-handed. Sustainable development is not possible without adopting a structural approach to the environmental issue. Nature will strike back with a deterioration in the climate and the accelerating disintegration of woods, sea and soil. We have experienced the effects of this close to home during the recent floods.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent example of the local market being distorted, and thus preventing any further development, is the dumping by the US of genetically modified corn on the African market. The famine that is currently affecting southern Africa does not mean that those countries should just accept anything. The Commission, fortunately, seems to be adopting a sensible stance. Countries should not be coerced, and it is unacceptable to take advantage of their famine.</p>
<p class="contents">The Deva report on trade and development, on which we reached agreement following tough negotiations between various political persuasions in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, is a warning signal to the European Council, a warning signal that the Council should cease to oppose the plans of Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, and of the European Commission. Let the Council now send out its own signal in Johannesburg, starting with a worldwide structural approach to the environmental issue and a worldwide structural approach to poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The first signal should be that of credibility. Tear down trade-fortress Europe, put an end to European theft, which is only detrimental to the income of the poor farmers in this world. Only then can we really talk about sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incredibly important that the European Parliament should keep this debate on the agenda and also never stop further developing not only the debate but also the practical proposals. I shall not present an inordinately long general and specific introduction but merely refer to Mrs Kinnock's words, with which I can declare myself completely in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought it might be discussed how much benefit we derive from a meeting such as that taking place in Johannesburg. Listening especially to those who participated in the Rio Summit, the impression can be created that Johannesburg is really just confirming what we achieved back then in Rio, and that is of course a rather sad state of affairs. I just saw the problem's being that, without these summits, we could not ensure that the debate continued but, that being said, Mr Deva has of course shown us one of the ways in which it can be.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I discuss individual points, I want to say that I of course think it important that we make demands both of ourselves and of the developing countries in terms, for example, of good governance, to which Mr Deva has also referred in his report. I should then very much like to comment on the first points mentioned by Mr Deva, namely points A, B and D in which he clearly emphasises that globalisation is here to stay, which is of course a good thing. If, however, we do not temper globalisation, it may end up by marginalising a number of countries and a number of population groups in those countries. This is, in my view, an incredibly important message. The second important message conveyed by Mr Deva relates to a situation outstandingly exemplified by ourselves and the EU inasmuch as we have of course grown up within the framework of protectionism. Moreover, it is as if we completely forget this when we go on to discuss the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very exciting train of thought Mr Deva has embarked upon when it comes to enterprises, which we cannot manage without. I should like, however, also to say that enterprises must not be used as a poor excuse for doing nothing in the sphere of general aid on which we unfortunately see countries cutting back at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyway, you have to admit that the majority of the world’s countries, and in particular the vast majority of their inhabitants, do not profit from progress in the area of production. You have to admit that billions of human beings are casualties of progress and that many of them are not guaranteed drinking water or food on a daily basis. By writing in the report that the top 200 companies have almost twice the economic clout of the poorest four-fifths of humanity, you do in fact recognise the responsibility of these huge corporations and their shareholders, whose enormous profits come from low salaries and from pillaging the natural wealth of poor countries. And yet the best you can come up with is to suggest asking these multinationals to set up ethical investment committees. As the very height of cynicism, you ask that these committees, and I quote, ‘should report to the board of directors, the shareholders …’, in other words report to exactly those who are pillaging, impoverishing and starving the planet. At the end of the day, failing to prevent murderers from committing their crimes makes us their accomplice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, we are convinced that a huge number of people in this hemisphere will be supportive of this report, but I fear that many will lose all interest when the welfare of their own electorate is put at risk. This is currently what we see happening at the Johannesburg Summit. This hypocrisy must stop. Economic globalisation is being imposed by the rich North and it is wreaking havoc in countries with weak economies, great social needs and weak democratic structures. We ask poor countries to open up their borders to our products, without giving them the opportunity to strengthen their economic structures first, as we did ourselves at the time when our economies first started to thrive.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are serious about the fight against poverty, concrete action of the sort requested by many here today is what is required. We must then open up our own borders, pay fair prices for products from the developing world and guarantee the producers a reasonable income. We must then abolish all subsidies for our own products if they lead to unfair competition with products from developing countries and to the demoralisation of the local producers who are responsible for food safety in their own country. We must then impose on our multinationals a code of conduct which protects weak economies, governments and peoples against arbitrariness and exploitation. Their great power brings with it commensurate responsibility for the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ashamed when I observe how privatisation makes entire peoples, entire countries or regions, dependent for their income on executive boards that only take account of the interests of their own shareholders. What means does a country such as Zambia, for example, possess whereby it can exert pressure on the owners of their copper mines, such as <span class="italic">Anglo American</span>? Countries that are dependent on a product, such as petroleum, diamonds, wood or sugar cane often have no defence at all against multinationals that determine the prices and regulate the market. It is a matter of power relations. It is therefore first and foremost our problem. We should, however, meanwhile display solidarity, and the rich north must realise that solidarity and the fight against poverty are a form of peacekeeping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I begin by congratulating Mr Deva on what I believe is a comprehensive, balanced and meaningful set of proposals. I particularly welcome his resolution because it restates our commitment to the principles of special and differential treatment of developing countries, to the importance of food security and to enhancing the accountability and social responsibility of corporations. The rapporteur's last point, the proposal for a European Forum of Enterprises in paragraphs 61 to 63, is an interesting one. But it should not deflect the Commission from ensuring that the current CSR Forum that it is due to launch in October fully addresses the actions of European enterprises in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make two substantive arguments in this debate. First, it is right to record in a report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation that we can enunciate all the EU development policies we like, but too often these have been submerged beneath the EU's own trade and commercial interests when it really matters. We remember the hypocrisy of the Commission and Member States in regard to the free trade agreement negotiations with South Africa. Initial responses to Mr Fischler's proposals on CAP reform, limited as they are, and current reports from Johannesburg suggest that Mr Byrne's words about the phasing-out of agricultural export subsidies may well be an empty promise.</p>
<p class="contents">If only the EU sought reform in the WTO with the same vigour it has won the USD 4 billion trade sanctions against the United States in relation to our steel exports, perhaps the poorest countries would start to believe us when we say we want a development round.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as other speakers have made clear, we have direct responsibility as the trade negotiations start with our ACP colleagues. Commissioner Byrne, when talking about the economic partnership agreements, should answer the questions that the Commission has refused to answer, before the process begins. Why does the Commission fail to talk now about the alternatives which were written into the Cotonou Agreement? Why does it talk about capacity building but commit only 0.1% of the current NIPs for trade support? How can we have confidence in the sustainability impact assessment when the Commission could not agree amongst itself on the impact of Everything But Arms on the sugar sector? Finally, why does the Commission resist the proposal from the ACP heads of government in Fiji to enter an initial phase of negotiations on principles with the ACP Group as a whole? Is it that the Commission wants to use the old tactic of divide and rule by attacking the solidarity of the ACP Group? That is not what this European Parliament wants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, in reply to some of the issues raised by honourable Members, first of all in relation to the ACP-EU trade negotiations, the European Union is prepared to further open its markets to ACP goods and services, provided the ACP States are prepared to implement appropriate policies and to strengthen their supply capacity. This approach will also be relevant in relations with other developing countries and groupings such as Mercosur, Central America and the Andean Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that economic partnership agreements are above all instruments for development. They will therefore be designed with all the flexibility required to take account of the economic, social and environmental constraints of the ACP countries. On the other hand, they must be integrated into the development policy of the ACP countries themselves and into the support strategies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that it has been suggested that the trend for economic support is downwards. There might be an element of truth in this, but there is reason to believe that this could well have bottomed out, having regard to the commitments in the Monterrey process. There is an expectation and a hope that this support should rise in view of that situation. Reference is also made to the need for support for the eradication of AIDS, TB and malaria. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Global Health Fund that has been established. A number of Commissioners, including myself, Commissioners Lamy and Nielson are working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The influence of the CAP has been referred to on a number of occasions. As has been mentioned, Commissioner Fischler and the Commission have brought forward proposals on a review of the CAP. You will have taken note of the fact that the supports there have been decoupled from production. In my view, this is a very important step in relation to the role of agriculture and supports and the impact it has on developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the food support in southern African states, particularly GMO maize, was mentioned, and I am happy to note the honourable Member's reference to the fact that the Commission had adopted a reasonable approach to this. In a statement about ten days ago the Commission pointed out again, as I and other Commissioners, and in particular Commissioner Wallström, have repeatedly said, that the scientific evidence available to us in the European Union indicates that GMO food is as safe as conventional food. That statement has been reiterated by the Commission in the last ten days in the hope of assisting in the impasse on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the concern relates to the fact that some of the governments involved are worried that some farmers might retain some of the GMO maize, resulting in cross-fertilisation with conventional crops in those countries. Most if not all of the maize that I understand is involved in these shipments has already either been approved within the European Union or has already received positive risk assessments from the scientific committees, even though it may not yet been given full authorisation due to the existence and continuation of the moratorium.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if there is continuing concern on this issue, the famine problem can be addressed by adopting a sensitive approach to the planting issue and milling the seeds involved, thereby eliminating the risk that some of the governments identified as being of paramount concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
