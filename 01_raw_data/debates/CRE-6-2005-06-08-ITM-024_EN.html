<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the author</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr Gargani, for whom I am deputising, sends his apologies. He had to return to Italy on urgent family business. However, as we are very pressed here today, I shall not talk to you for eight minutes. I do not consider that this issue requires it. Allow me therefore to say a few words on the purpose of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, we sat together under the coordinators of the Committee on Legal Affairs and decided that, as we are having problems – and I use the word advisedly – with a whole series of proposals for legislation in the field of intellectual property rights, it might perhaps make perfect sense if Parliament as a whole were to address this question once more and take this opportunity to discuss this once again with the Commission and – at a later date perhaps – with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt whatever as to the crucial importance to the European economy of our introducing a permanent single patent in Europe. I recall our resolution on the Lisbon process. I recall the resolutions which we adopted on this and initiatives in previous years. We here always took the view – almost right across the political divide – that the European patent had a particular worth and is of crucial importance, including within the framework of the Lisbon process, if we are to be able to guarantee the competitiveness of the European economy with the economies of other regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I will not conceal the fact that some of us – and I in particular – were very concerned at developments in the Council. We know that the Council is considering creating a patent which must be translated into all the official languages of the European Union; however, this is as yet unfeasible because unanimity is required and the consent of all the Member States has not been forthcoming. Such a patent would be extremely expensive. It would not be competitive, nor – if it came about – could it ever be converted back into a normal, proper patent. Everyone knows that English is the language that matters and plays an absolutely dominant role in technology and in the granting of patents and that translations into other languages are basically superfluous, achieve nothing and just cost money.</p>
<p class="contents">Once such a language regime has been created, there will be no getting away from it. That is the experience in the European Union and that is also the consequence of how legislation is usually passed here on such issues. Against this background, I am very concerned as to whether we can and will ultimately get a patent that really can meet the specifications that we have set, including within the framework of the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is the fact that such an expensive patent would ultimately discriminate against medium-sized businesses, because the few large companies which exist – and they will be not only European but also, above all, non-European companies – will register their patents throughout the Community under this new European patent, while small and medium-sized enterprises – and they account for 70% or more of all patent holders – will be unable to do so because of the costs involved and will have to rely on small, inferior, national patents and regulations under the European Patent Convention. This second-class society in patent legislation cannot be what we want in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the <span class="italic">de facto </span>blockade in the Council and the risk that, if this blockade is lifted, an inferior patent, an inferior patent regulation will emerge, the question which arises is this: what does the Commission – which has the right of initiative and the monopoly on initiatives – propose in the way of possible new initiatives to kickstart this again and perhaps still attain the noble objective of the Lisbon resolutions up to the point at which we have a European patent.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which concerns us and which played a considerable role in the report at the time by a 'green' colleague, Mrs Mercedes Echerer from Austria, is the question of collecting societies. We in the Committee on Legal Affairs addressed collecting societies on various occasions in the previous legislative period, both within the framework of directives in which they played a role, and in the Echerer own initiative report. We came more or less unanimously to the conclusion that it is necessary, when acknowledging the role of collecting societies, both in the decision-making processes of these companies and in fee structures, to achieve an adequate degree of transparency both for the benefit of users and in the interests of the holders of the intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Commission is considering this and has already carried out or is already carrying out a follow-up assessment with a view – and this was also announced in the Commission's legislative programme – to submitting a specific proposal for legislation during the course of this year. However, I now hear from the Commission that the question of whether there should be a recommendation or whether a directive is needed is still open. I would welcome information from the Commission as to what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">We know full well that the 'market' at issue here is not of the same order of size as in other cases, but it is nonetheless of importance to the development of the European single market that we clarify this question, ensure there is reasonable transparency in this sector and perhaps also take initiatives in order to facilitate the cross-border use of copyrights. There are at last thoughts and activities in this direction also. We would be interested in hearing what the Commission intends to do about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Efforts have been made in the Council and at bilateral level to settle these points. Despite substantial agreement between the Member States on this issue under the Irish presidency, none of the solutions discussed has won unanimous support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already invested a lot of time and effort in work on this file. While I am prepared to make one more attempt to reach agreement on the Community patent in the future, I will only do so when I believe the conditions to be favourable. However, alongside the Commission’s work on this issue, we also need all supporters of the Community patent to speak out strongly in favour of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the collective management of copyright, my services are currently carrying out a thorough impact assessment in preparation for a possible Community initiative. The overall aim of such an initiative will be to ensure the more transparent and efficient cross-border management of collective rights in Europe. This should provide commercial users, broadcasters, webcasters or other online service providers with better access to information about the scope of the repertoire licence and the applicable terms and tariffs. A more transparent management of copyright across the European Union should help stimulate more use being made of copyright content which fosters the development of new attractive services and the technology that is used to provide such services.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative will take due account of a consultation of stakeholders and of the recommendations of the report written by a former MEP, Mrs Echerer, on collective management of copyright and related rights. There is no blockage in the legislative process in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as enhanced cooperation is concerned, any support from the Commission for such an initiative in the field of industrial and intellectual property would depend on its impact on the economy and society and its added value compared to the existing situation. Moreover, legal issues, such as those arising from the extent of existing Community competence, would have to be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first, I would say, is the linguistic aspect, which Commissioner McCreevy has referred to, and I would add that things cannot perhaps be simplified as much as my colleague, Mr Lehne, did in his speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the technological domination of one language that has almost a monopoly, the European Patent Convention recognised other languages, and other languages are also recognised in the European Union Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market, based in Alicante. I have the impression that it is possible that up to a particular level, certain languages may have a degree of recognition, in accordance with the use of patents in those languages and the operation of national patent offices. I therefore believe that the issue must be clarified and that, as Mr Lehne has said, the Commission could undoubtedly help to find a formula to get us out of this <span class="italic">impasse</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second aspect, relating to collective management companies, the fear may be that a Commission proposal, for example, taking the radical approach of the Bolkestein Directive of total liberalisation, could end up removing any possibility of effective protection of intellectual property rights. At the moment, we have a series of national systems for protecting intellectual property and a simple liberalisation could lead to authors losing their protection, in other words, replacing the system consisting of a series of national markets relatively well protected by their national management bodies, with a system in which there is no type of protection, could put authors, designers and inventors in a difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like, therefore, to call on the Commission, when drawing up this proposal, not to make the same mistake as the Bolkestein proposal, which, as we know, has today even been one of the elements used to argue against the approval of the European Constitution in the referenda, but rather to seek a system that links the need for harmonisation in this field with the protection of a basic service, the protection of intellectual property and of artistic and literary creation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, there is one effect which must not be underestimated: as long as patents continue to be as expensive as they are now, much of their protective function is lost; patents can even block rather than foster innovation. However, when we see, from the other side, that the need for diversity and the fostering of diversity are entrenched both in decision-making processes and in the minds of Europeans, then it will be hard for us to simply leap this hurdle. I therefore think that we here in Parliament must pay special attention first and foremost to the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are inseparable from the competitiveness that we urgently need to support, and on which subject, Commissioner, I have heard little from you. At present the situation is untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, this also applies to the question of copyright. I would point out here that the approach so far, compared with intellectual property rights, is no longer adequate, especially in the field of art – the performing arts, music, and so on – on the Internet and in view of all the changes here. People are saying that we cannot make criminals out of a whole generation who simply download whatever they can from the Internet with no sense of wrongdoing. Besides, it is our duty to make a strict distinction between this and software patenting, because the blurred relationship between the European Patent Convention and national case law has created a problematic situation, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel it is wrong to create a Community patent at any cost, as this indeed undermines the interests of small and medium-sized countries, with regard to both the language arrangements and the role of the national institutions and national patent agencies. This is, of course, quite apart from our concerns as regards any case of patents affecting key areas such as life, natural heritage, software and medicines, and which often only serve the interests of the multinationals. As for the language arrangements, as mentioned in this House, we do not feel it is right to provide for the use of only a limited number of languages. This goes against the principle of non-discrimination between companies and creates a genuine directory of main languages. Accordingly, a precedent is set and the use of all of the official languages is put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that the best way of defending micro-enterprises and SMEs in all Member States is to uphold the principle of non-discrimination between countries and companies and, especially, in terms of the language arrangements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
