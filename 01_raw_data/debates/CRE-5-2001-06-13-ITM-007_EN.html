In this respect, ECHO has this year already allocated EUR 15.5 million for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. ECHO is focusing particularly attention to vulnerable groups: internally displaced people (of which there are more than half a million), the disabled, women – particularly widows – and children.</p>
<p class="contents">The needs of women and children are specifically addressed in mother-and-child health programmes. Projects are being implemented by <span class="italic">Médecins San</span>s <span class="italic">Fronti</span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic">res</span> of Belgium; <span class="italic">Médecins Sans Fronti</span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic">res</span> of the Netherlands; and from France, <span class="italic">Action contre la Faim, Aid Médicale Internationale</span> and <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde</span>. All aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as monitoring the health status of women, in particular nursing mothers and pregnant women. Usually, NGOs also provide their female patients with elementary hygiene education. These projects are implemented in areas where internally displaced people have settled. Currently, there are medical projects in the Panjsher Valley, Herat, Kandahar, Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif and Hazarajad.</p>
<p class="contents">NGOs have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical programmes, in spite of the fact that separation between the sexes has to be strictly observed. For instance, ACF employs between 55 and 65 per cent of women in its medical programmes. Medical NGOs play an important role in the professional training of women. They organise medical training sessions for small groups of women in cooperation with the Taleban Ministry of Health. We also carry out Food-for-Work projects. Income-generating activities for women, which encourage self-sufficiency, are increasingly supported by ECHO. Since 1999, ECHO has financed Food-for-Work projects in Kabul for men and women through German Agro Action and Medair from Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">While men are occupied in land recovery works and city drain cleaning, women are given raw materials and knitted quilts and sweaters, to be distributed to other beneficiaries. This kind of programme entails the participation of women from a variety of socio-economic classes, from educated to illiterate women, each using their knowledge and/or all manual abilities. They are paid a fixed rate in wheat seed every two weeks. This pilot project in Kabul was subject to an independent evaluation, which proved to be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">MEDAIR is in the process of implementing a second phase. Similar operations are now funded by ECHO in Mazar, Kandahar, Herat, Kabul and Faizabad, through UN Habitat and various NGOs. On other types of project, I can inform you that NGOs, with the support of ECHO, try whenever possible to have women involved in each project. Even in shelter programmes women are involved. Female health monitors go from house to house visiting women in order to provide them with basic information on hygiene, primary health care and conservation of water and food.</p>
<p class="contents">Operational partners such as NGOs, international organisations and Red Cross, family and UN agencies closely monitor all operations through expatriates and local staff present in the field. All ECHO partners are bound by a framework partnership agreement, which obliges them to be present and, in relation to us, to present financial and operational reports of their activities on a regular basis. Furthermore, ECHO has field experts, who also follow the ongoing projects very closely to ensure correct delivery of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, following UN sanctions and meetings in Europe with General Massud, the Northern Alliance commander, meetings in Europe, the hardliners within the Taleban movement seem to be gaining the upper hand, as reflected in the hardening of their position against work by women. Unfortunately, this general state of affairs is escalating, as we can read in press reports now.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in conclusion we can say that, despite the difficulties, NGOs in Afghanistan are doing their best as our partners to alleviate the suffering of women in the country. ECHO is not carrying out development cooperation as such, but is delivering humanitarian aid. Clearly, for many Afghans – women and men, educated and uneducated – the activities we support are a valuable, and by and large the only, form of assistance. Maintaining access for this humanitarian aid is crucial, and we will continue our work, even if the circumstances are difficult and appear to be worsening at present. I am planning to visit Afghanistan in September with a view to stepping up this effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You know that the President of the European Parliament, and some other MEPs too, received a delegation from Afghanistan. We very much want to support them and be by their side. Despite your detailed answer, I do have to ask you for further information.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde</span> has been rallying its efforts over the last few days to alert people about the famine and drought in Afghanistan. Yesterday, they came here to Parliament once again. As we know, drought is a terrible thing and this drought appears to be the worst in 30 years. We also know that there is no water irrigation system to combat it. Nothing has been done for 20 years – there are no dams, for example. The situation is terrible and it would now appear that the harvests are down by 65%, a quarter of the population is directly affected by drought and hunger and one million people are heading for the borders. Apparently, life in the camps is increasingly dangerous and, according to <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde</span>, food distribution in Afghanistan is extremely erratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, I need to be able to respond, Commissioner, as, in the dossier being circulated by its members, <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde</span> has condemned the fact that the European Union’s contribution has fallen from 50 million in 1991 to 36 million in 2000. We are, therefore, moving towards a decrease in aid and assistance to Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like you to give me an answer on this issue and also to tell me whether – given this situation, the politics, the drought and all the problems that you have mentioned – it would not be more crucial to increase our food aid and to put in place a genuine comprehensive policy on humanitarian aid. Even if this exists – you did mention this – should it not be better coordinated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the situation in that country does not make it possible to organise and implement normal development cooperation. What we are doing is making a relatively large-scale effort in terms of humanitarian aid. This year ECHO has identified Afghanistan as one of the "forgotten conflicts", in order to focus on and raise awareness of the need to mobilise international society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the access problem is a real one, partly because of politics in Afghanistan. The major challenge we face is to restate and explain the need for everyone involved on both sides of the conflict to accept unhindered access to the country by humanitarian organisations.

<p class="contents">While welcoming the increased international attention paid to the tragic and immense consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, malaria and tuberculosis, including the Commission’s programme for accelerated action in this field, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0096">COM(2001)0096</a>, it is obvious that there is an urgent need for efforts far beyond this initiative – and indeed beyond the pharmaceutical industry’s lowering of prices – in order to address the pressing needs in terms of prevention as well as treatment. The UN Secretary-General recently proposed the establishment of a global fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and urged donors to make firm commitments before the UN General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS in June. The amount needed has been estimated at $7-10 billion per year. President Bush recently announced an initial US pledge of $200 million.

I will quote from the first part of this: "The Council and the Commission note with concern the devastating impact of HIV/ AIDS and other communicable diseases on human suffering and on economic and social development and hence also on poverty reduction efforts. The proposal by the UN Secretary-General to establish a global HIV/ AIDS and health fund is therefore fully welcomed. The Commission and Member States will explore how best to develop this initiative." The Commission is taking an active part in the negotiations concerning the modalities and all the issues relating to this fund. There are a number of points we consider important. I will go through them, quoting from a speech I made on this issue during the LDC Conference on 16 May.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we would wish to see a number of principles or conditions fulfilled. I will name just a few. One, donors should make available additional and new resources over an extended period of time. The Commission does not have access to additional resources. We have a specific budget. The Commission is not in a position to tax directly, as you all know. So it is, in fact, the political decision-makers who decide on taxation who can provide additional resources. We cannot.</p>
<p class="contents">Two, the OECD countries need to take measures to assume a fair share of the global financial burden of reducing poverty and disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, we do not support single-issue funds and plead for a broad approach targeting the three major communicable diseases – malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/ AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Four, we will continue to raise the need for country ownership, integration with national development strategies and health systems development, effective coordination on the ground and keeping prevention efforts to the fore. This is crucial. If all this is not helped by a fund, the fund is no help at all. So, does it improve delivery? We have had enough empty donor-driven manifestations. If the answer to the question about delivery is not a clear "yes", the establishment of the fund will only be like crossing the creek to get wet feet.</p>
<p class="contents">Five, a fund should be open to contributions from all interested parties, both public and private, and should support action beyond the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Six, the governing structure of the funds should be light and transparent. The basic and multilaterally agreed health policy principles of WHO should be secured on how it is managed.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven, the fund should be outcome-driven as opposed to input-focused.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight, decreased transaction costs for countries should be a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that a global fund cannot succeed and will not get our support without a commitment from industry to a global, tiered pricing system.</p>
<p class="contents">These conditions may look very demanding but they, represent in fact, the mainstream of shared international policy in this area. It would be a tragic mistake to organise a fund, which is supposed to be a procurement fund, for special, expensive types of medicine. Today this is something which we more or less agree upon. But that is not how discussion about the fund started out.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the discussion so far has been meaningful, but please note that as far as mobilising money is concerned, today we are not even allowed to provide core funding for UN organisations. Even under the new financial regulation, which we hope to get but do not yet have, we will not be allowed to carry out normal core funding, although we hope to be allowed to provide programme-based funding for UN organisations. This fund, however, will not be a UN organisation. What is on the cards here is to ensure core funding for this fund.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is as easy as it may be portrayed in the press, but we are, in substance, a very active player in contributing to making the fund a meaningful and well-organised entity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we agree that this is one of the most serious epidemics and not only one of the most serious humanitarian catastrophes but one of the most serious economic catastrophes the world has even seen.</p>
<p class="contents">As much as ten years ago, based on the ways the disease was spread, sexual practices of the time and the widespread poverty in many African countries, experts were able to make forecasts showing that there would be a spread similar to that which we have today and which has had such incredibly tragic consequences. Unfortunately we are now able to make the same forecasts for other parts of the world which were infected later, and the outlook is similar.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to proceed is, naturally, prevention with a mixture of support initiatives for those already affected and preventive initiatives, partly in the form of information and education and partly in the form of efforts to find a vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">I naturally agree with the Commissioner that no problems will be solved simply by setting up a fund. I also agree with many of the requirements for such a mechanism which Mr Nielson sets out. At the same time, it was my experience in setting up UNAIDS, of whose board I was a member, that we constantly had too little money and were able to implement far too few ambitious initiatives. During the years of setting up the project we actually had no money whatsoever to support the national initiatives in the countries most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as Mr Nielson has stated, the UN bodies’ normal budgets have fallen, which means that we are suffering from a major lack of money. I am sure that money is needed to achieve success in terms of research and active initiatives at national level. I therefore believe that Kofi Annan’s initiative is good, as long as this mechanism can be set up in a good and non-bureaucratic way.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that the Commission cannot conjure up money from nowhere. However, there was a major surplus in the EU budget for last year which has recently been returned to the Member States. It must surely have been possible in such an extraordinary situation to gain support from the Council for a substantial aid package. It would otherwise look very strange, bearing in mind the Commission’s very great commitment in the course of last year and the initiative in which Mr Nielson and others were involved in September – October 2000. I would also like to test Mr Nielson a little further. Given that the soundings ahead of the New York Summit in a little under a month’s time are positive and that this mechanism can be set up properly, what plans are there for us in the EU, Member States and the EU itself, to be able to put forward a decent sum to bolster the preventive work? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is also true in cases where countries choose to opt for treatment. Treating HIV-positive persons may mean that many of them can continue functioning, as schoolteachers or whatever. But the treatment is ongoing year after year, and the impact on national health budgets, even if they are given these anti-retroviral drugs for free, is incredible. The real bottleneck in the use of advanced complex medical treatments is not necessarily access to the drugs but the organisation of their delivery. Few people realise that we are talking about 18 to 20 different pills or medications that have to be taken at intervals of a couple of hours, around the clock; that their composition has to be changed every few weeks and that all of this has to be very strictly and precisely organised. On top of this, all these persons need safe drinking water and at least two good, varied meals per day. In a developing country, that is asking quite a lot.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is not so easy. We have been informed that Merck and the Gates Foundation have jointly set up a USD 100 million fund for Lesotho. On top of that, Merck has provided free medicine in order to solve the problems of delivery on the ground. They have been working on this for a year without much progress. This is why it is not just an evasive response to lay stress on prevention. We have seen that it can work in the case of Uganda and in other places too we are beginning to see the AIDS curve go down.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the response from Mr Wijkman. It is true that these organisations need money. We will come to this in the next question. But it will never be the role of the Commission to be a major supplier of general funding as such for the UN organisations. Freeing up additional money for these purposes is the role of the primary donors, that is the governments, who have the right to tax their citizens. That is how we mobilise additional money. It may also be possible to mobilise new private money. I hope this fund will be a breakthrough by doing so on a systematic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As to our own unspent money, the fact is not that we have money floating around, which we then send back to Member States. The way the system is administratively organised in the case of the European Development Fund is that we call in money on a quarterly basis from the treasuries of the Member States on an ongoing basis. We have real commitments that have not been translated into actions in terms of spending the money. But as I have told Parliament on many occasions, we are going through the whole portfolio, reducing and scrapping those commitments that are not implementable and accelerating the flow in the pipeline. Most of the money is in principle committed – implementation is the real challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">As you were informed earlier, the rate of commitment from now on for AIDS activities will be at the level of about EUR 800 million a year. This shows that in terms of contribution, we are a major player and are making a big effort in these countries. The question remains to be answered: will we be allowed to do it legally and will this fund actually mean improved ability to deliver on the ground? These are the questions that we need to come back to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, as he said in his answer, there are many ongoing discussions. We very much welcome the summit that was called by Kofi Annan. We very much welcome his own round table which was organised last year and which made substantial progress at European level. I am aware that there is a proposal for a further such round table jointly between the European Union and US interests. Would the Commissioner comment on whether he feels such a proposal is timely and whether he would be interested in participating in such a meeting?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, after the South African case, Mr Nielson's colleague, Mr Lamy, did commit European Union technical assistance to developing countries afflicted by the HIV/ AIDS pandemic, to utilise the national emergencies clause in the WTO to examine the use of generic drugs and of parallel importing to secure affordable medicines. Would the Commissioner comment on whether the European Commission has been successful in identifying developing countries to utilise these monies in this way and what further steps he plans to take in order to achieve this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That was more promising than many other things we hear from his government. It remains to be seen whether the announced contribution of USD 200 million from the US Government to this fund is approved by Congress, and whether it will in fact be additional money, but that does not form part of our more restricted deliberations here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is useful to pursue the dialogue with the United States on these issues, especially where we could feasibly agree on a practical approach, so I will continue working in this vein.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the second question on using the national emergencies clause as a basis for opening up for some of the elements in the TRIPS Agreement, have been sending a clear signal to our partners in the developing world that the Commission is interested in supporting their efforts to find and use the most flexible interpretation of the Agreement and we have also stated – as we did at a joint meeting with the CEOs of the major pharmaceutical companies that Pascal Lamy and myself attended – that we see a need to check the existing agreement, so as to ensure that the interpretation is good enough to facilitate better use of these possibilities in developing countries. However, we have not pinpointed any specific cases on which we can focus and act in a concrete manner. That said, we have expressed a strong desire to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done is to apply pressure by announcing a total untying with regard to all essential drugs used to treat these transmittable diseases. Opening up not only regionally, but also globally, should make price differentiation more difficult. It should also make for a change in stance from bidders from around the world and from the generic drug producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answers today. No one who has listened to the Commissioner over the last few years in this House could doubt his commitment to removing poverty and disease from the world as efficiently and effectively as possible using EU-resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to ask him a question about the third disease mentioned in this report, and suggest to him that perhaps we should concentrate on this least glamorous of the three, because tuberculosis could be eradicated. Unfortunately HIV, as you say, is likely to be with us for a long time and at the moment we are largely into palliative care as regards HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">A concerted world programme over a relatively short period of time could eliminate tuberculosis from the world. I have a particular interest in this, because the cure was actually pioneered in my home city of Edinburgh 70 years ago. We thought we had eradicated it in western Europe, but it is re-emerging now. If we can remove it from the developing nations, we can also remove it from the world permanently. That is the prize – the permanent removal, which is unfortunately not yet available to us as regards the two other diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if there is a delay in getting the World Fund going on the other diseases, perhaps we could suggest to Kofi Annan and the UN that we have a pilot project concentrating specifically on tuberculosis, which might inspire nations to contribute to the other areas once we see success in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of the reasons why we have insisted all along – it has not always been easy because public attention has been almost exclusively focused on HIV/AIDS – that malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS have to be looked at in the same manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The best economic data we have to illustrate the benefits of doing these things efficiently relate to polio eradication. It has been documented that the world can save USD 1.5 billion per year in ongoing costs if we can mobilise the USD 400-450 million it takes for a 2-3 year final offensive to wipe out the remaining centres of active polio around Nigeria and northern India. It is absolutely feasible and it is an incredible pay-back. As regards TB, the mathematics are similar but it is more difficult to eradicate.</p>
<p class="contents">For TB and malaria, the economics of the cure are very different. They cannot in fact be compared to HIV/AIDS, for which there is no cure, only treatment in the mortality rate of HIV-positive persons in the world. If we did what we ought to do for malaria and TB, that would bring about as much improvement as we could ever achieve with anti-retrovirals. This is the real issue. There is good reason to give more attention to TB and malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the main contribution of our action programme. It was also supported by the round table last September. It is exactly for that reason that I am somewhat stubborn about creating such a fund when we are not sure about the modalities and the policy of that fund. I therefore welcome the contribution concerning TB. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only the remainder was used in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">If you then also bear in mind that, recently, more soya was used than was needed for nutritional purposes, because the feedingstuff manufacturers calculated that it was in their interest to do so, then the protein balance in feedingstuffs barely changes. The amendment to the ban on feeding fishmeal and meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry accounts for less than 3% in the import system in terms of volume. Less than 3% is simply not enough to trigger huge speculation or somehow put the Community under pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, the Commission works in close liaison with individual national authorities in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, more funds could be used to resolve the problems caused by the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco failed to materialise. First and foremost, of course, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, which can be used to apply for Community grants for the fleets and the fishermen and shipowners affected. In addition, aid can also be granted within the framework of the European Regional Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance Fund in order to diversify into other activities in the coastal regions affected. In all events, we need to start by deciding on the measures and then calculate how much money is needed. And, in view of the conclusions of the European Council in Nice, the Commission is currently checking if additional funds are available for restructuring the fleets affected within the framework of the current financial perspectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, may I clarify exactly what we have to do here. We cannot set a figure and then allow the Spanish to review how the money received is to be disbursed. The legal bases stipulate that we are obliged to do exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the measures needed because the Morocco agreement failed to materialise must be defined. Then we must stipulate what proportion is to be funded from the existing Regional Fund, from the existing Social Fund and from the existing Guidance Fund. If these funds do not suffice, then we must consider where we can find the additional funds needed and the Commission is prepared to discuss this. However, until we have decided exactly what measures are to be implemented, the Commission cannot name an amount. That is a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also remind you that even the last Morocco agreement contained a reduction in the size of the fleet and that, logically, not only would we have had to maintain this reduction in any new agreement, we would have had to do so with the money currently provided for in the funds. You are wrong to maintain that Spain now has a claim to EUR 250 million per annum because this sum was provided for in the previous agreement; on the contrary, Spain has a claim to a solution to the problem which has now arisen. What we now have to consider is how much money and what sort of money is needed in order to provide such a solution. That is the correct procedure and there is no alternative to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But if this agreement were going to be for three years, those concerned would be expecting 375 million euros from the solidarity of the European Union. We are all aware of this and we hope that the Commission will be generous in paying attention to the petitions from the Governments of Spain and Portugal. We will continue to work towards this in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But my question has a different aim. I wanted to ask the Commissioner if he is aware of the information that is being published in the Moroccan press at the moment, specifically in the weekly <span class="italic">Demain</span> and the magazine <span class="italic">Economy and Enterprise</span>, where top military, political and diplomatic figures in Morocco are being accused of having blocked this agreement to protect their own personal interests. It is currently being said in the Moroccan press that they only declare 60% of their catches and that they are lining their own pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">This, according to what is being said in Morocco at the moment, seems to be the real reason. They were not concerned about fishing resources, as they told us, or the Moroccan fisheries sector, or even the Moroccan people, but something else.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of these reports that are being published? They give names. If so, is it aware of what is going on and are political, economic, financial and trade relations with Morocco going to be re-established in the light of what is happening, which is just what we suspected, and which was the real cause of the failure to cooperate with the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have to say that I am not familiar with the details of the accusations which have been or are being made. But I can assure you that one of the main reasons we said a new agreement had to be set on a new financing basis and a new funding method had to be found was in order to preclude any such suspicions from the outset. That is why we were keen not to do the same in this new agreement as we had in earlier agreements, i.e. to pay out the money without earmarking it for a specific purpose. Part of the negotiations involved earmarking these funds. Then, of course, the Moroccan side would have had to maintain records of how it had deployed the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this needs to be the general model for the future. We really cannot agree to provide funds when some or practically all the money paid is clearly being used to develop their own sector without any accounts being rendered as to how these funds have been used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Bilingualism in Istria</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 9 April 2001 the Regional Council of Istria (Croatia) adopted a regional statute which provides for parity between Italian and Croatian in all regional institutions and all procedures of administrative bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, on 23 April 2001 these rules were suspended by the Croatian Ministry of Justice, which argued that their constitutionality had to be confirmed. This is despite the universal view that they are consistent with the spirit and letter of the Croatian constitution (or Fundamental Charter).</p>
<p class="contents">There is great consternation and concern at the serious problems which would be created for the Italian-speaking population, given that Italy's status as a friendly nation and founder member of the EU should ensure the existence of full Italian/Croatian bilingualism in the border areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission state its views on the compatibility of the negotiations on the association and stability partnership offered by the EU to Croatia with a view to closer relations with this decision by the Croatian government, which is visibly contrary to the basic principles of the EU and its 'acquis' and is a clear case of violation of the rights of cultural minorities? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Protection of minorities through safeguards against discrimination, access to education in minority languages and preservation of minority cultures have always been an important element of EU conditionality in our relations with Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment to such safeguards was reiterated and formalised in the stability and association agreement with Croatia, initialled by the Commission on 14 May. Croatia has renewed its commitment to respect its minority population and cultures and the adoption of national legislation supporting the use of minority languages was one of the first achievements of the new Croatian Government last year. Since then the draft of a new comprehensive constitutional law on the protection of minorities has received a favourable opinion from the Council of Europe's Venice Commission and work on the issue is continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has every reason to believe that Croatia will apply this legislation seriously. Meanwhile we are looking forward to the opinion of the Croatian Constitutional Court on the Istrian statute.
