Disappointment and frustration which are all the greater when we consider the substantial progress of European policies in other fields, for example regarding the East, Central Europe and the Balkans, and also relations between Europe and Latin America. It is obvious to all of us that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership has to complement the European policy for the Mediterranean Basin. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the basic points upon which we expect a detailed response from this debate: the clause which sets out the basis of the agreements, on respect for human rights, the undertaking to draw up ratification instruments for giving effect to the association agreements, and the development and acceleration of new linkages for a cooperation process with Libya, provided that the requisite political conditions are in evidence at the Cairo Conference on 3-4 April 2000. Mr President, I would also like to stress the need to forge ahead with objectives that facilitate a greater involvement of civil society in creating networks linking cities, ports, universities, trade associations, entrepreneurs and non-governmental organisations, for the INTERREG programmes to be used to promote balanced development with regard to trade and territory through the modernisation of economic structures, so that the MEDA programme, which has received such a disappointingly small amount of funding, can at last bear fruit. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, may I say that the Union’s Mediterranean policy could become one of the common strategies laid down by Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union regarding foreign and security policy, and that we could also promote the political dimension of the issue through parliamentary debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is a general consideration. I would like to make this very clear to the representatives of the Council and the Commission: as a group, although I imagine that we are not the only group to feel this way, we are concerned that the Mediterranean policy which, in 1995, was at the centre of a major project, the Barcelona project, no longer appears to be a political priority for the Union. This is a general political concern. We feel that Mediterranean policy needs to be thoroughly analysed and relaunched, on a par with enlargement, or perhaps more so than this, seeing that the enlargement strategy is now safely underway. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point is more specific. In our view, Barcelona defined the major points of this policy, but, with the passage of time, these have been lost from sight. Our feeling, which will become apparent from the resolution which is to be put to the vote, is that complete priority has been given to a procedure for the development of a free trade area, shifting the emphasis from other policies which, in our opinion, should go hand in hand with the objective of building a free trade area, which we fully support. This means that the pillars which were the basis for Barcelona must be adopted and perhaps even reinforced. I refer to a policy of support for investment, support for employment, support for decentralised cooperation and support for a policy of joint management of migratory flows, and also a policy for culture, schools, young people and for setting up dynamic, worthwhile exchanges between these countries and their communities. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we stress the fact that, although the association agreements are important and their ratification procedure does need to be speeded up, they cannot be used as the basis for a policy which must, by nature, be multilateral. And this is a weak point. We therefore welcome the major step taken by Parliament in deciding, through the Presidents of the Groups, to convene the Interparliamentary Forum. We agree to support the civil forum. We welcome the French presidency’s announcement in its programme of its intention to hold the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles, but we feel that the Marseilles Euro-Mediterranean Conference must be more than just a run-of-the-mill administrative conference. The political signal which we must all send out together and the instruments which are decided upon must be capable of successfully relaunching this policy and restoring its status. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have been clear. We feel very strongly about this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And yet two of the fundamental causes of the breakdown in the debate have now been eliminated: a new Commission is installed in Brussels which numbers the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of peace and stability among one of its priorities, and peace negotiations between Israel, Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon are once again in progress. </p>
<p class="contents">It is time for Europe to send a political signal to reopen negotiations with non-member countries of the Mediterranean, and this is why we welcome the idea from the future French presidency of the Council of organising another Euro-Mediterranean Conference. However, the agenda must tackle the central issues and not skirt around them, as it currently threatens to do. We are also concerned at the total lack of interest shown by the Commission in reopening the debate. And yet much remains to be done in order to relaunch the three cooperation chapters decided upon in Barcelona. A large workshop needs to be opened on promoting the protection of human rights in the area of justice, in a framework of mutual respect, for we cannot make concessions for anybody on human rights issues, not even civil Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">For a long time now, Parliament has been proposing to create a Euro-Mediterranean Court of Human Rights modelled on the Court in Strasbourg, and also to set up mutual consultation mechanisms to facilitate applications for peaceful solutions to conflicts and the fight against organised crime. Political dialogue must be structured and take the form of regular consultations. To this end, we propose that Summits of the Heads of State and Government of the Mediterranean countries of the European Union should be held regularly, and that the role of the special envoy for the Middle East should be consolidated, so that we do not relinquish the political role we desire to the United States. There is now no reason to exclude Libya from the debate, and it should therefore take part in the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to economic and financial cooperation, the Commission has the duty to relaunch negotiations for the signing of trade contracts which are socially sustainable. This is extremely important, for the mutual benefits are very great. At the same time, however, I would stress that the bilateral approach hitherto adopted by the Commission does not seem adequate to meet the numerous challenges presented by the Mediterranean. Economic cooperation must include multilateral/bilateral approaches facilitating the promotion of trade among Mediterranean countries and south-south trade. This multilateral approach must also be mirrored in the fields of cultural and social cooperation. The promotion of a culture of diversity, of individual freedoms applicable to all members of a multi-cultural society, of peaceful coexistence and of dialogue across religious divides with respect for universal human rights, and the affirmation of women’s rights and freedom, hinges on multilateral cooperation programmes, which must include a number of countries. In this sense, it is essential, in addition to being the Union’s responsibility, to support democratic organisations from the civil society of Mediterranean countries and parliamentary dialogue modelled on the Euro-Mediterranean Forum. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the need to create a Euro-Mediterranean area of peace, economic justice, citizenship and stability is common to both sides of the Mediterranean. It is a major challenge, a foreign policy which the Community institutions must undertake to pursue in order to provide the Union with a political and cultural project which will bring about peaceful coexistence and growth in the face of different territorial and cultural conditions, and, putting aside the myths and legends of days gone by, make the Mediterranean a genuinely peaceful area, and not one of conflict or of abuse of power or where impoverished immigrants lose their lives attempting to reach Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe stands for the noble values of peace, freedom and social development, values which have to be constantly defended for the very reason that they were won at a high price. However, the economic progress of Europe is now threatened by globalisation, and our continent is in serious danger of recession due to competition from South-East Asia – where labour is one tenth of the price – the United States and Japan. Our defensive strategy of enclosing ourselves in a single market and barricading ourselves in will ultimately prove to be a losing one. We cannot shirk the challenges thrown up by globalisation, but have to learn how to approach and exploit them. </p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is still the greatest benchmark of Europe’s capacity to exert influence beyond its borders. The present issue consists in developing a Mediterranean policy in a Union which is skewed towards the north-east and is focusing less and less on the Mediterranean Basin in the South. The Mediterranean policy is set in a context of wide-ranging interests and latent tensions, and it therefore has to include various different elements such as the development of peace-keeping initiatives – now that the Middle East peace process has been relaunched – and we are grateful for the way that the Pope’s visit to the Holy Land is improving relations between the different religions, leading them towards mutual understanding and support, and the creation of partnership projects involving Northern and Southern Europe, for the very reason that the objective of transforming the Mediterranean into an area of dialogue, tolerance and cooperation that guarantees peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will and sustainable, balanced social development. The need for a different, more efficient Mediterranean policy for the developing countries in the Basin cannot be disregarded. Too many unnecessary interventions have been made, while the need remains for aqueducts, schools and the means for young graduates to build a life for themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, much work still remains to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are preparing for unprecedented enlargement and, at the same time, we are working on reform of the institutions in order to be able to best manage such a large political entity. We cannot underestimate the value of the Mediterranean region: it must be a privileged partner in our policies, an important border on which we must focus our attention. The process defined in Barcelona in 1995 for building an effective Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is still ongoing, despite the intention expressed by the European Union governments to include the Mediterranean policy among their priorities, an intention fully supported by our group. Despite the progress made at bilateral and multilateral levels, the Charter for Stability and Security is still awaiting completion. The Partnership is still far from achieving its objectives. The forging of multilateral relations has not led to sustained expansion, and the cultural, social and human partnership is highly inadequate. Since the completion of the peace process is essential for the smooth development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, does the Commission not consider that the Commission and the Union should take resolute action to further the Middle East peace process? </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the economic and financial partnership, in addition to creating a free trade area by 2010, would the Commission specify the actions it intends to promote in the countries concerned in order to accomplish the objectives of macroeconomic stabilisation and the process of liberalisation and privatisation, to simplify laws and to consolidate social policies. By what means is the Commission going to make the MEDA programme more efficient? What are the actions it is going to undertake to reduce income discrepancies and to encourage the creation of infrastructures and the reviewing and updating of trade agreements? What are the specific actions that the Commission intends to adopt to create a genuine cultural, social and human partnership? </p>
<p class="contents">Let us go right back to Barcelona and return to a global tack, fostering the priorities that have been ignored and promoting the development of civil forums, to encourage the active participation of civil society. Let us make it our firm political will to relaunch the Mediterranean partnership, defining a new generation of programmes to prevent fragmentation, improve coordination and ensure the efficient use of resources. </p>
<p class="contents">Our group has faith in the Mediterranean, and wants the European Union to accord to it the strategic, economic and political importance it once had.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is genuinely important for the future of the European Union, as it is the only way to prevent Europe becoming an island of prosperity surrounded by poverty. However, if enlargement towards the East is inevitable, how can we explain that enlargement should only happen in one direction, taking us further away from the Mediterranean, which is so near by, forgetting how near the countries of the Maghreb are, some of which enjoy a special association status with the European Union, and that our future is intimately connected with theirs. This is no need to remind you of the important common interests we have with those countries in terms of agriculture and fishing, nor the serious shared problems relating to immigration between Andalusia and Morocco, which create added difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">European regions such as Andalusia, which are very close to the countries of the Maghreb, share more interests and problems with those countries than they do with other Member States of the Union, and far more than they do with the future candidates for enlargement. In fact, this love-hate situation between certain Community regions and the Maghreb creates unnecessary tensions, both economic and social, which we must resolve by putting all our powers of negotiation on the table and by using all the existing mechanisms, or new ones which should be created, in order to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, do the Council and the Commission believe that the creation of an inter-regional body or council for the Straits of Gibraltar, consisting of political representatives of the bordering countries and the European Union itself, could be useful and allow for the decentralisation of cooperation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to emphasise that relations with the Mediterranean countries are a priority that has been specifically included in the Portuguese presidency’s work programme for this six-month period. We are familiar with the main mechanisms that have been established by the European Union in this area, so I shall not go into them now. However, regarding the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, I would like to point out that an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership will be held during the Portuguese presidency – on 25 and 26 May – with the purpose of establishing a frank and open dialogue on the partnership’s workings and priorities. In particular, it will seek to do this by making an inventory and undertaking a critical analysis of the way we view the <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>of the partnership, which we know can be seen quite differently by states on opposite shores of the Mediterranean, so that we can provide the necessary impetus for the three areas of the partnership’s activities. Another purpose is to prepare for the Barcelona IV formal meeting of Foreign Ministers which will be held in Marseilles in November under the Barcelona Process. We think that it is important to undertake this assessment not just to be consistent in following up what we have already done in Stuttgart, but also in order to analyse new priorities in some sectors where cooperation needs to be developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">As to establishing a free trade area, which is another area in the process of Mediterranean relations, we feel that this should not be seen as an end in itself, but as a means of improving our citizens’ living conditions and of increasing their level of income. It is also particularly designed to reduce the disparity that today exists in relation to the citizens of the European Union. The establishment of this area will certainly give the Mediterranean countries an opportunity, by means of a process of free trade, to be part of a more interdependent world and, in this way, not to remain on the fringes of this global trend towards greater prosperity and well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the MEDA programme, which is an important instrument in this context, the total sum available to the MEDA II programme for the period 2000-2006 has not yet been announced and the Commission has stated that it will soon announce proposals for distributing budget heading IV for external relations, which includes the MEDA programme. The Council is looking at the proposal submitted by the Commission at the end of last year to simplify and improve the MEDA regulation procedures, in response to a request from our Mediterranean partners. We know from past experience that some of our southern Mediterranean partners, together with certain EU Member States and the Commission itself, which has in fact made a specific assessment of the system’s actual effectiveness, consider that part of this system needs to be improved. In our opinion, the proposed mechanisms would go some way towards achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has also been consulted on this proposal, and the Council hopes that it will soon give its opinion. The MEDA programme also funds activities in the areas of education and professional training, currently to the tune of around EUR 1 billion per annum. The loans from the European Investment Bank, which are of the same order of magnitude, are mainly designed to finance infrastructure and environmental projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Barcelona Process, a meeting of employment and professional training experts will be held on 31 March and 1 April, precisely in order to look at how the southern Mediterranean countries can be helped to define national policies for employment and professional training and to exchange information and experience. The broader objective is obviously to contribute to increasing competitiveness, as this in fact depends to a large extent on the level of human resources training.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the role of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, which was mentioned in one of the questions to Council, I would like to confirm that the European Union attaches the greatest importance to promoting a coherent and comprehensive policy for the Mediterranean region. We intend to play an active role in this area, not only in the context of the Barcelona Process, but also with regard to the Middle East peace process itself. The High Representative is particularly committed to issues of this kind and took part in the last meeting, held in Moscow, of the Ministerial Steering Committee, which gave fresh impetus to the multilateral track of the Middle East peace process, in which the European Union is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Other specific issues on which the EU intends to continue working are, as you will be aware, the drafting of a common strategy on the Mediterranean, as was decided at the Cologne European Council and reiterated at the Helsinki European Council. The Portuguese presidency is currently preparing this common strategy which, I would like to point out, is quite different to the previous two common strategies with Russia and with Ukraine, which were bilateral. This is more of a horizontal, multilateral common strategy, and involves a set of approaches which, in our opinion, must attempt to go further than the Barcelona Process itself. By this I mean that if the common strategy does nothing more than repeat what is in the Barcelona Process, we will gain no added value in terms of a coherent EU policy towards our southern partners. Our aim is to be able, by means of this common strategy, to contribute to a new approach, and in particular to take account of developments in the Middle East peace process and the way in which these developments reflect – positively, we hope – on strategic relations within the Mediterranean itself. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also working on an issues paper on the future of the region so as to be prepared to play its full role when peace is achieved through the Middle East peace process. An analysis of the issues on which the EU is particularly well placed also needs to be carried out, notably on security, water and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability, which has attracted the attention of this Parliament and which is occupying the Council, following the remit given by the Stuttgart Ministerial Conference in April 1999, a schedule for work on this issue was drawn up, and meetings on this subject were held in November, December and March. To date, discussions have concentrated on the principles to be included in the charter, on its means and mechanisms and on its institutional provisions. A further meeting is due to be held here in Brussels in the next few days. Work is also going ahead with a view to preparing a report on progress to date, which will be studied – informally – at the meeting of Foreign Ministers to be held in Lisbon during the Portuguese presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to another question, the Council does not currently envisage a multilateral treaty between third countries. The European Union considers that first of all, encouragement needs to be given to all spontaneous forms of south-south cooperation, which are still limited, and to speeding up trade agreements between Mediterranean countries, for which technical support has already been made available. While I am on this subject, Mr President, I would like to say that many of the complaints made about how the Mediterranean process is working are very often mirrored in the way north-south relations function. I would like to stress quite clearly, without wishing to be critical in any way, that here too we have a clear example of what was laid down in Barcelona: a great deal of homework remains to be done between the countries on the southern rim of the Mediterranean regarding their lack of interregional relations. Furthermore, the southern Mediterranean countries have acknowledged this themselves and unless this work towards interregional cooperation in the southern Mediterranean takes place, the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation process cannot succeed. It is also vital that this message should reach our southern partners, as otherwise, all we will have are individual approaches to the EU’s relationship with each of these countries, and we will never manage to establish a common area. In order to establish this common area, all of the southern Mediterranean countries need to understand that they will have to make concessions and maintain a constructive dialogue in order to achieve intra-regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the French presidency intends to pursue the work that was started in The Hague in March 1999 on migration and the exchange of peoples, by organising a new meeting of high-level officials in the second half of this year. This is an extremely sensitive issue and we acknowledge the importance and the relevance of the question put to the Council, but this requires solid preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the target date of 2010 and the question we have been asked about setting up a committee to look into what action may be necessary, we do not currently intend to set up any committee, but it is our firm intention to pursue and to conclude negotiations for association agreements between the EU and the Mediterranean countries as quickly as possible. For this to be achieved, the will to succeed must be present on both sides. The association agreement with Morocco recently came into force, on 1 March, and the presidency is certain, given the progress made in ratification at national level, that the agreement with Israel can also come into force in June. As you will all be aware, negotiations with Algeria will continue in mid-April and should have resumed with Syria at the end of March, but they have just been postponed due to a new government taking office in that country. The Portuguese presidency hopes that significant progress will be made during its term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, with regard to the Euro-Mediterranean agreements, it would be wrong to hope for regular growth in what can be expected from these agreements. The Euro-Mediterranean agreements cannot become a kind of launch pad which provides substantial and cumulative advantages for those countries which enter into agreements at a later stage, as compared with the benefits obtained by the earlier signatories, which would amount to a kind of institutionalised sleight of hand. The countries of the southern Mediterranean have to understand that we must be in a position to guarantee equal treatment and that delaying tactics cannot be used to gain advantages in agreements signed at a later stage. In particular, they must understand that earlier agreements cannot be reviewed in the light of benefits subsequently acquired in later agreements. This is not a process of accumulation, but one of balance and fairness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made efforts to show the southern Mediterranean countries that establishing the Single Market has been a positive experience. For this reason and in line with what I was saying earlier, we have been encouraging those countries to try to harmonise their legislation as far as possible with EU legislation. This is part of the regional programme for industrial cooperation under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and the Portuguese presidency has decided, in conjunction with the Cypriot government, to review the situation with Industry Ministers on 21 to 23 June in Nicosia. We think that this is of the utmost importance. This will be the third Euro-Mediterranean meeting on this subject at Industry Minister level.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East peace process, the question Parliament has asked raises a fundamental issue. The visibility of the Middle East peace process is not an end in itself for the European Union. We feel that the key factor underlying the Council of Ministers’ action is the attempt to contribute to the success of the peace process through our presence and our action. We have been steadfast in our support for this peace process not only through considerable economic assistance – and I would like to make it clear that this assistance is unparalleled in the history of the Middle East – but also through the political initiatives themselves and their constructive support for the efforts of the United States and other key participants. Something that should be borne in mind is that the visibility and the presence of the EU in the Middle East peace process should be what the partners in this peace process wish them to be, rather than being visible in the way some countries might wish them to be. We will do what we can to assist the peace process, because it is peace that we are interested in and not our own visibility in this peace process. In this area, I would like to make clear our commitment to the Palestinian track, through our support for implementing agreements which have been concluded and by offering to contribute to discussions on that country’s permanent status. With regard to the Syrian track, the Council continues to be steadfast in its commitment, particularly through its Special Envoy – whose work I would like to say has been extremely positive – to helping both sides to move towards reopening bilateral negotiations, which did in fact happen, as you will be aware, last December. We hope that the new era in Syria’s international relations that we are now witnessing will lead to some progress in this area, as we are aware of the interdependence of all the tracks in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the United States and Russia, who are co-sponsors of the multilateral track in the process which was started in 1991 in Madrid, the Council has been working towards normal recommencement of the activities under this track, after an interruption of three years. This effort led to the meeting of the Ministerial Steering Group which took place on 1 February, at which the go-ahead was given for most of the multilateral groups to restart their activities as normal this spring. In their capacity as joint chairs of the Working Group on Economic and Regional Development, which has 53 members within the region and outside it, the Council and the Commission will bring this group together at a meeting on 8 to 11 May. The European Union will also host the next meeting of the steering group in July.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting of 24 January, the Council asked the High Representative, assisted by the Special Envoy and the Commission, to look more closely at issues in which the European Union is specifically committed to playing a major role, such as issues concerning security, water and refugees. The High Representative was also requested to submit for our consideration a discussion paper on future prospects for the region so that the EU is fully equipped to play a major role once peace is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation with civil society, which is one of the points raised in another question, is still an essential element in the development of the third chapter of the Barcelona Process. A whole range of activities has already been developed, such as the establishment of a youth forum, and I hope that at the Lisbon Summit we can look at which areas these activities under the third chapter can be focused on, in order to enable civil society to play an increasingly important role in this area. With regard to financial support for non-governmental organisations working in this field, this is obviously a matter for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Arab Maghreb Union, the Council is convinced of the importance and the need for cooperation in a region of 80 million inhabitants sharing the same language and religion. The Council has therefore, as I have said, consistently encouraged regional cooperation in the Maghreb through its political dialogue with Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. Therefore, regardless of any cyclical developments that may have had a negative influence on relations within the Arab Maghreb, and we hope that they are only temporary, we have high hopes for positive developments in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to relations with Libya, a considerable advance was made with the lifting of sanctions, with the exception of the weapons embargo, last September. The Council has confirmed its desire to see Libya participate fully in the Barcelona Process and hopes that it will be able to give its full and unreserved acceptance of the Barcelona <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The Ambassadorial Troika has, in fact, just visited Libya, on 26 and 27 March to be precise, and it was made quite clear to Libya that its acceptance of the Barcelona <span class="italic">acquis</span> would mean that it would have to negotiate an association agreement with the European Union in order to be able to join the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area to be established by 2010. The issue of negotiating an agreement of this kind with Libya is not currently on the agenda, but the Council will discuss this if and when it becomes an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">To respond to a point raised in another question, the Council is aware of the challenge presented by private investment, which is one of the essential levers of growth. Under the Portuguese proposal presented under the Mediterranean Forum and subsequently followed up through the Barcelona Process, a conference on investment throughout the Mediterranean area was held in Lisbon on 28 February to 11 March at which there was substantial representation from the private sector. The participants highlighted the low and inadequate flow of investment to the Mediterranean region in comparison with its potential, and in comparison with other parts of the world. They also highlighted the various factors which favour investment and which must be drawn together and strengthened, and specifically the need for sufficiently large markets, which must be built through the establishment of a progressive Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area.</p>
<p class="contents">At that conference the Commission announced the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean network for cooperation between investment promotion agencies, which should enable it to be kept up to date, and for support from the institutions to be provided through a training and know-how programme. In addition to this, a study of barriers to direct foreign investment was initiated, which we trust will provide us with reliable data by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the issue of the Western Sahara, which was mentioned in another question, the Council has been supporting the work of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the work of his Special Representative for the region, Ambassador Eagleton, and that of the Special Envoy, Mr Bacon. The Council noted the report submitted by Mr Bacon on 17 February, according to which the timetable that had been set was no longer valid as, at the time, no new date could reliably be set for the referendum to be held. We are aware that this new factor could have a negative effect on the whole process. Nevertheless, the Council is pleased that the High Representative intends to request the Special Envoy to explore ways and means of finding an acceptable and lasting solution to this conflict. The Council confirms that it is willing to contribute to establishing a climate of trust between all parties in order to find a solution to the problem of the Western Sahara based on human rights and on respect for democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now conclude, Mr President. I have, of course, been answering a very long series of questions, and if I did not give the various questions the attention they deserve, certain honourable Members might naturally start thinking that the presidency was not paying due attention to their questions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have gone into great detail on some of the different aspects of current Mediterranean policy, even though this subject deserves even more detailed treatment in my opinion. Although there are grounds for disappointment in view of the expectations raised by the launching of the Barcelona Process in November 1995 – and I am perhaps one of the few people here to have been present at that launch, at the signing of that agreement – this is largely attributable to the political circumstances in the Middle East, which were favourable in November 1995 but which have deteriorated considerably since then with the impasse that has arisen in the peace process. Nevertheless, we should not forget that despite these problems, the Barcelona Process has been able to continue and I think that it is important to highlight the fact that this is the only body that has managed to get the Mediterranean Arab countries, Israel and the European Union round the same table, which, in my opinion, in itself represents a considerable step forward. We believe that the fact that a new Israeli government is taking office, with a new policy of relaunching the peace process, means that we may once again have grounds for hoping that there will be positive repercussions for the development of the Middle East peace process.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, on behalf of my colleague, Chris Patten, I have the following comments. The Commission agrees on the need to reinvigorate the Barcelona process and will soon be putting forward ideas which should enable us to move the process forward this year, particularly in the light of the Euro-Mediterranean Summit which is likely to take place in mid-November. The text of the Charter for Peace and Stability should be agreed at the meeting in mid-November. It should be as meaningful and far-reaching as possible. I should like to see regular security and stability discussions open to all partners willing to participate. In addition, we should develop cooperation on drugs, terrorism, migration, good governance and conflict prevention, at least with the Maghreb countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to see an enhanced human rights dimension in the partnership. We should have a frank and open dialogue on the policies needed by partner governments to improve the situation in this respect. We shall use MEDA and the specific MEDA democracy programme to support positive actions, particularly by NGOs, to promote respect for human rights and democratic freedoms in the region. The economic objective of the partnership is to create an area of shared prosperity through the progressive establishment of free trade accompanied by substantial EU financial support for economic transition and to help the partners confront the social and economic challenges which this implies.</p>
<p class="contents">Programmes financed by MEDA are in place to support industrial modernisation, structural adjustment, development of the private sector, training and promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. All programmes contain conditionalities ensuring that their social impact is taken into account. I intend to ensure an even tighter focus on priorities in our financial cooperation in the future, particularly by concentrating on sectoral adjustment facilities. These will enable us to focus on the key objectives of the partnership and will also improve the disbursement rate on MEDA.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of MEDA has been subject to criticism, some justified, some not. It is a young programme with specific objectives linked to the implementation of free trade with the partners. Often the final beneficiaries are not the partner governments. This has, in itself, increased the complexity of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has put forward a proposal to amend the MEDA regulation to ensure a more strategic approach to programming, better coordination with other donors, including the Member States, and streamlining of procedures. The proposal is still under discussion in the Council, and I fear, that far from supporting these objectives, the Council may be moving in the direction of making the procedure even heavier. I count on the Parliament to support our efforts. For my part, I shall also ensure that internal Commission procedures are reformed in a way to speed up delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment is a major issue which was addressed at the important conference held in Lisbon on 29 February and 1 March. That conference showed that the key to increasing the regions’ attractiveness to investors is for the partners to have flourishing, open, competitive economies with a secure and predictable legal and administrative environment. We shall use MEDA to support the partners’ efforts in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cooperation to ensure that the region presents a unified market is also vital. Sub-regional free trade areas should be supported as a step towards the global objective. I want to encourage the harmonisation of single market measures among all partners – an action programme should be agreed later this year – and to offer diagonal cumulation of origin to those partners who agree free trade among themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional infrastructure is essential to economic development. MEDA supports, among other things, the interconnection of infrastructure as regards energy, transport and new technology. Investments in these areas are primarily supported by loans from the European Investment Bank as well as other donors. I shall continue to ensure that the right mix of funding is used to ensure that public and private actors can play their appropriate part.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agriculture is concerned, there should be a thorough consideration of all of the issues related to this sector with a view to seeing what we can do to improve market access with the objective of free trade. In addition, we are considering the introduction of a regional cooperation programme which could focus on processing and conservation, quality standards and animal health.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for civil society is key to the development of the human dimension of the partnership. I shall ensure that civil society is supported but as far as the old decentralised cooperation programmes are concerned, I shall not repeat the mistakes of the past regarding financial management and administration. NGOs can benefit from a number of programmes. The SMART Programme on the environment, the Cultural Heritage Programme, the EUROMED Youth Programme and MEDA Democracy, for example. I will consider what more we can do while respecting the need for sound financial management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For some reason or other, these agreements have not been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It would certainly be cause for satisfaction, and would be a significant step in the right direction, if this debate were to persuade the Commission to promote a more active attitude to the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement. From reading Parliament’s joint motion for a resolution, which we will probably approve tomorrow, we can certainly observe specific proposals which we can use as a starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that we all agree on the strategic importance, which is crucial for the European Union, of its Mediterranean influence; politically, since, being neighbours, we are required to build a relationship which goes beyond the constitution of a simple free trade area; economically, because I am convinced that opportunities for mutual benefit are being created which we are not taking sufficient advantage of; also, socially, because the problems of the extent of economic inequalities and of the great pressures resulting from migration require coordinated and structural solutions and, of course, we also have to mention the question of security.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, Parliament is justified in repeating its request that the European Union make a more decisive contribution to the peace process in the Middle East, especially given that the parties in the conflict requested this explicitly during the recent visit to the region by the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that, in order to be successful, a European Union common foreign and security policy must be based on the concept of balance in order to respond to the sensibilities of all the Member States and, therefore, of all the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The moment has therefore arrived to make an assessment of the Euro-Mediterranean policy, an assessment of the results achieved and also of this policy’s delays and shortcomings. In this respect, this debate and the motions for resolutions tabled by the Groups in this Parliament are very appropriate initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">This assessment certainly includes some positive aspects. On the one hand – and this is no small thing – the process has continued, despite the negative factors that have affected the Middle East peace process. The summits and meetings have always been held with the presence of all the countries involved, including Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Secondly, although progress has been slow, we have seen the signing, ratification and implementation of a series of association agreements. Thirdly, we have been developing a permanent routine for intergovernmental cooperation and we have been implementing the different financial aid projects of the MEDA programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these results cannot lead us to ignore the delays and shortcomings which, in part, have frustrated the hopes and expectations raised at the first Euro-Mediterranean Conference of November 1995. Firstly, there has been no decisive political thrust when we really needed it. Strictly speaking, it could be said that, in political terms, Mediterranean policy should today be the main priority of European Union foreign policy. Enlargement towards the East, in strategic and historic terms, leads to a scenario in which the only uncertainties are the timetable, pace, cost and means for achieving it. Even allowing for possible new regional conflicts, it is difficult to imagine any outcome other than the culmination of the enlargement process. On the other hand, there is no certainty whatsoever when it comes to the future of the Mediterranean. It will depend to a large extent on the policy of the European Union as to whether this region becomes a ‘sun belt’ with a new economic and social balance in a context of security, development and peace, or a ‘slum belt’ where the norm will be an increasing imbalance between north and south, galloping poverty in the south and the progressive emergence – forgive the repetition – of every type of emergency: violence, instability, terrorism and uncontrollable migratory pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that, as a result of this lack of political direction, the economic and financial dimension has experienced obstacles and delays. In this respect, we should point out the difficulties involved in launching the MEDA programmes, the excesses of centralisation, the heterogeneous nature of aid criteria, the lack of joint reflection on the possibility of a common Mediterranean agricultural policy and, thirdly, and as a consequence the tiny amount of direct investment in the south: just 2% of the total of the European Union’s direct foreign investments. This is an illustration of what could be described as the “strategic blindness” of the European system as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a new phase is necessary, with the Portuguese and French presidencies, a brand new start for Euro-Mediterranean policy, which could promote a ‘virtuous’ circle encompassing the objectives which were correctly drawn up at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona in November 1995. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased to see that the joint resolution adopts the suggestion we made to ask the Commission and the Council to publish an annual report on the situation regarding human rights and the rule of law in the countries of the Mediterranean. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that it is not enough to make declarations of pious intent about human rights and the rule of law and then forget all about them, the way many things are forgotten. No, this policy must be made a key element in bilateral relations. We should therefore tell those countries where human rights are not observed that bilateral relations may be forced backwards, and we should tell the countries where there is real progress, such as in Morocco or elsewhere, that bilateral relations may go forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take Tunisia as an example, one of the first countries with which we signed a partnership agreement. The situation of the rule of law and human rights in this country is scandalous. Right now, there are people held there as prisoners of conscience. The Tunisian government declares itself to be in favour of opening up economic relations, but who is entitled to a passport in order to be able to leave Tunisia? Who is entitled to travel and to make use of the Mediterranean area? Not the opponents of the regime. Right now, there are two people on hunger strike in Tunisia because they want passports in order to be able to travel, specifically a publisher, the wife of Mr Ksila who was one of the people nominated for the Sakharov Prize. </p>
<p class="contents">I am bringing up these subjects because I believe we must not cease to remind the countries of the Mediterranean of their responsibilities as regards the rule of law and human rights. It is not enough to have a healthy economic balance sheet. It is not enough to achieve good results in agriculture or anything else. Respect for human rights must take precedence in our policy, and that is not the case at present. It is not the case, and it is something we have to change, and that means Parliament, as well as the Commission or the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is official. The relaunch of this policy announced by the forthcoming French presidency of the European Union bodes well, since the countries in this region have to face extensive and urgent challenges. In order to respond effectively to these, it is crucial that the interests of the peoples around this central sea are truly taken into consideration, and that the people participate actively in the partnership. Let me say from the outset that the time has come to change the course of Euro-Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the objective of a policy of this type must be to tackle the blatant disparities between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, which keep the peoples of the south in an explosive economic and social situation. Poverty, a high level of illiteracy, massive unemployment, particularly among young people, extreme inequalities and an increasing technological deficit compared to Western countries. There are considerable infrastructure needs, not to mention environmental challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The effect of this widening gap can only be to increasingly foster the most violent forms of nationalism, fundamentalism and war. Indeed, the weight of foreign debt, the drop in the prices of raw materials and structural adjustment plans have already forced these countries to adopt swingeing austerity programmes and have wrecked their capacity for development. The prospect of a free trade area, a sort of regional MAI, is liable to dangerously exacerbate these power struggles. Studies show that two thirds of Tunisian industry would not survive the opening of frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">The slowdown in the process indeed stems as much from the deadlock in the Near-East peace process as from the many concerns expressed increasingly overtly: for instance, the first Euro-Mediterranean trade union conference held a year ago which highlighted the complete absence of the social dimension. There are, however, advantages to establishing things from scratch. Citizens, NGOs and trade unions are committed on a day-to-day basis to supporting solidarity between peoples and to putting many local cooperation projects into practice. The Euro-Mediterranean process thus calls for a pooling of resources which should be advantageous to all concerned in moving towards a common area of prosperity, which was the objective set in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many possible ways out of the dogma of free trade that was challenged in Seattle. It is more than time to wipe out the debt of the countries of the South, and to engage in technology transfer and cooperation in the areas of training between public services.</p>
<p class="contents">I should finally like to say that, besides working towards peace in the Middle East, which the European Union must continue to strive for, I am just as keen to seeing Europe play a much more active part in ensuring that the referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara, which is under serious threat, is held in the conditions stipulated under UN authority. The credibility of European foreign policy is at stake here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Because of the complementarity that actually exists between the interests of the two continents of Europe and Africa, this vast Euro-African entity which necessarily revolves around the Mediterranean, our Mediterranean policy is invested with an importance, and I might say a seriousness, which unfortunately finds little reflection in the programmes carried out to date by the European institutions and the fact that, as in the case of MEDA, three quarters of the programmes adopted are still not applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything goes to show that, in fact, in this matter we are truly unaware of what is at stake. We have heard it said that the stakes are vast, and it is worth repeating. If we manage to create a unified, fraternal union between the lands to the north and the south of this sea then we shall continue to hold a position at the centre of world balance instead of being consigned to the sidelines in favour, it goes without saying, of other geostrategic formations, those of the Atlantic, primarily, or the Indian Ocean, or, above all, the Pacific, centres on whose periphery we are increasingly nothing more than supernumeraries. </p>
<p class="contents">There is no salvation to be found here, except by a proactive approach which – let me say quite bluntly – involve our regarding transatlantic communities of interest or relations with the continent of Asia as secondary and focusing on privileged relations, ‘privileged’ in the precise meaning of the word, with the Arab world. This would mean, for example, accepting countries such as Morocco, Tunisia or Algeria into the Union as Member States in their own right.</p>
<p class="contents">Without this proactive approach we should have no chance of gaining control of the balances, or rather the increasing imbalances in the world, or any control of economic flows – I am thinking particularly of raw materials, but also of agricultural production – no control of demographic flows, where balances are disrupted at great speed and to our disadvantage, as everyone knows, but also no control of cultural flows, for we certainly have no better allies than our Arab and African partners in resisting what is hastily termed globalisation, but which I feel is rather the general Americanisation of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Our nations will remain great powers in the next century only insofar as they have successfully met the challenge of the Mediterranean partnership. </p>
<p class="contents">I hardly need express our pessimism in this regard. Firstly, because this key aspect is struggling along lethargically, with vague impulses served up in the form of speeches, witness the so very insipid Barcelona Process, this pathetic alibi for our basic indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">Pessimism, too, because our transatlantic partner, the United States of America, has fully understood that there is no better way to subject Europe to its domination than by cutting the productive links Europe may establish with its neighbours around the Mediterranean and is striving to erect a vague but effective wall between the two sides of the Mediterranean. Episodes such as the Gulf War and the proscription of Libya, and even of Syria from the international arena, in which we were skilfully manipulated by Washington, were just the most recent illustrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Pessimism, finally, because Europe remains too divided on this point, with too many states, particularly northern European states, preferring the Atlantic connection to the Euro-Arab or Euro-African connection, as evidenced by the gradual abandonment of the Lomé policy and the weakness of our Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, on this matter, as on other matters, it is only the nations that can attempt to take up this great challenge, primarily France, which is still the leading power on the Mediterranean coastline, by means of its Arab policy and its policy of establishing links throughout the French-speaking world. France may be acting alone, but it is acting for the benefit of Europe as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too have questions about MEDA, not just for the Commission but also for those who have submitted these questions. For example, I have a problem with the conclusions they have based their questions on. They talk in terms of progress in the Middle East peace process, peace returning to the Balkans and improvement in the situation in the Maghreb. I join them in hoping that structural improvements are taking place in the regions concerned. However, I believe it would be jumping the gun to make drastic changes to the Mediterranean policy on the basis of what are likely to be incidental developments. I also take issue with the idea that the Mediterranean policy has been a complete disaster. We have most certainly notched up some successes in the four years we have had the partnership, notably the conclusion of the various Association Agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">By that I do not mean that we as a European Parliament should subscribe to the European Union’s current Mediterranean policy without a word of criticism. There is room for improvement in the vast majority of areas. As far as I am concerned, our first priority should be a change of attitude. If we use the term “partnership” to describe our relations with the Mediterranean countries, then we are committing ourselves to taking our partners seriously. This will undoubtedly lead to modest thoughts about Europe’s role in various peace processes, and in the upholding of human rights in partner countries. It will also lead to a more balanced Mediterranean policy on the part of the EU. The concept of partnership implies the articulation not just of European but also of Mediterranean thoughts on political and economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not just about underlying attitudes. We also need to give the management and implementation of the MEDA programme our attention. This has been found to have serious shortcomings in recent years. The Commission proposed various amendments last year. Seen in this light, we will need to reflect on the future of the Mediterranean policy in the coming months, focusing not so much on incidental developments as on the need for a long-term view. Honesty, balance and equality are the key words here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the inclusion of Libya is crucial. Libya in particular has a great deal of catching up to do in telecommunications now that the embargo has been lifted. I visited Libya a month ago and found the people, especially the young, to be open-minded and most interested in Europe. It was clear from talks with the rector of the university and students that the long-term embargo has left many young people traumatised by a feeling of powerlessness and being distanced from the north. I think that now we must all do everything we can to prove to the people in all the Mediterranean countries that we recognise them as equal partners and offer them assistance, both in order to restore their trust in us as well as to solve their economic and social problems.

All this helps to shape the development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and give it direction. </p>
<p class="contents">Along with other Members who have spoken, I am convinced that, although there have been delays, these may not all be due to technical factors, but also to the basic intention – which I do not support – to reduce this process to the creation of a free trade area, and I am not denying the importance of a free trade area. The development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must mean more than this: there is no doubting the fact that it must also promote an infrastructure which is linked to the values of the civil societies, to cultural, social, tourist and sporting exchanges, and linked to the development of these contributions, which are not directly related to the creation of a free trade area but which complement it.</p>

Therefore, we need an active undertaking from the Commission and the Council, openly supported by Parliament, to make more resources available to sustain the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a level of resources which is proportionate to the resources already used to sustain eastward enlargement. The Cannes European Council made a commitment of this kind, and it should not be forgotten. We must contribute to the development of a favourable climate for private investment, with technical assistance support which provides the same kind of support and aid for these third countries as that supplied to the CEE countries, the possibility of an interregional and transnational cooperation programme aimed at achieving complementarity and integration between the countries of the Mediterranean Basin through coordination between the MEDA and INTERREG programmes, and the possibility of a new generation of programmes to remedy the current fragmentation and inefficiency of a host of Community programmes for the Southern Mediterranean, which, at a rough count, already involve over seventeen different Directorates of the Commission and countless microprojects which, in all probability, do not fulfil this purpose.</p>

What I mean to say is that, in any event, I share the Commission’s concern and I think the proposal to simplify the procedures is a positive one. I hope that this Parliament will support it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the few seconds allocated to me, I will simply refer to two aspects which I believe should be dealt with urgently in relation to the MEDA programmes. Firstly, decentralised cooperation and the activities generated by the Barcelona Process between the most active social operators from the non-Community Mediterranean countries and the European Union. These are projects, which, as well as having intrinsic value, create growth in the social sectors in these countries. It seems essential to me, since we want an area of free trade and prosperity, and since we also want to push decisively for democratisation in this area in the southern Mediterranean, that we support the men and women who are trying to work in this field. We must put an end to the poor esteem in which they currently hold the Union and we must once again ensure that their expectations and ambitions are supported by the Union. I believe furthermore that the Commission must have sufficient human and material resources to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which concerns me is the inclusion of immigration in the regulation. I am concerned about how this issue will be dealt with in the Mediterranean area. We must not only create agreements on the readmission clauses, and not only provide resources for guarding borders. We must also, by means of imagination and new measures, create the capacity for co-partnership with these countries, so that we can adopt a legal approach to the issue of immigration and so that people do not simply feel that we have closed the border to them but that they can move freely within this free trade area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This debate is also appropriate because this Parliament’s delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries visited Morocco and Tunisia last week, with a full working agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the situation is different to the situation some years ago, since we can see certain slight improvements in specific areas such as human rights and in the economic field, despite certain difficulties. In general, we have seen a common desire on the part of these countries to associate themselves with their neighbours in the north who form part of the European Union, since they see us as their sole hope of solving the problems they are facing on a day-to-day basis. That is why the different European institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, must make an effort so that these people in the Mediterranean area may improve their situation. To this end, we must carry out a decisive and courageous policy which will allow us to successfully confront the Euro-Mediterranean challenges which have arisen in this globalised world.

Let me draw the attention of our fellow Members to these reports which are currently being discussed in committee and which are to be presented before the House in June.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, I should like to highlight two important points: firstly, MEDA is a good programme, a young programme, which has to date suffered from inefficiencies in its implementation. Less than 30% of the total appropriation in the order of EUR 3 500 million for the last four years has been paid to date, what with delays in payment, observations from the Court of Auditors on the examination of the files and excessive time periods. The regulation must be amended and Commission staff must be increased. We shall have proposals to present to Parliament to this effect in order to ensure better examination of the files. Next, 90% of the appropriations are reserved for bilateral cooperation, but only 10% for regional cooperation, which is of great interest to us. This must be increased, decentralised cooperation must be stimulated and the participation of civilian societies must be utilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this programme does not focus solely on economic matters and free trade. There is also the definition of a common area of peace and stability, and the concern for rapprochement of peoples by means of a social and cultural partnership. Finally, it plans to bring third countries up to par in terms of respect for human rights and, in this regard, in many countries the situation is showing no signs of improvement. We therefore request that the Council and the Commission publish a report annually, or every two years, on human rights in the countries participating in the Barcelona Process, which could be used as a basis for the implementation of cooperative operations between the European Union and third countries. Tunisia, which Daniel Cohn-Bendit has just mentioned, has alone received 10% of the MEDA appropriations, almost all of which have been paid. This is something that we must take into account specifically in order to ensure that it is the European Union which is actively directing the projects and that the projects are not just decided according to … </p>

<p class="contents">I think that we can learn something from the concerns expressed on all sides. In the minute I have, let me say that the European Union’s Mediterranean policy lacks strategy, and it lacks a timetable and clear objectives in contrast, if you will, to its policy on Eastern Europe. It would be impossible to summarise the Minister’s answer in five lines, because he referred to all the issues but did not answer the key questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in my opinion, there is a lack of generosity. The European Union is stuck on free trade, despite free trade zones having negative economic and social consequences in those areas. It could, on the other hand, be adopting direct, specific and effective measures on issues such as debt or technology transfer, where we see hesitancy and a lack of effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that in my opinion the European Union has no autonomy. We see this in the Middle East vis-à-vis the USA and on a broader scale, too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must ponder the European Union’s role in furthering the peace process. Clearly, the European Union cannot take sides, and I feel that it should, instead, make a substantial contribution to the economic development of the whole area, focusing, in particular, on economic growth in the communities that border Israel, for, quite apart from religious issues, the political conflict is without doubt exacerbated by marked social inequalities. Consider the difference between the <span class="italic">per capita</span> income of Israeli citizens and that of the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries and territories which border the State of Israel. An improvement in the economic well-being of these communities would certainly mitigate the explosive political and social situation which has resulted in repeated conflict.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">One of the European Union’s main tasks is to minimise tensions. I therefore support all the points of this report which highlight the need for economic interventions that bolster the development of programmes and the development of private investment and boost the presence of private operators from the European Union in the territories which border Israel. This will further economic stability, which will go a long way towards defusing some of the social conflict. If we succeed, if the European Union succeeds in doing this, it will have made a substantial contribution to securing peace in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From Lisbon in 1992 to Cannes in 1995, and especially in Barcelona that same year, there have always been requests for a strong Euro-Mediterranean Partnership to be established. The European Union and twelve Mediterranean countries were consequently pleased to adopt the famous Barcelona Declaration in 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">This declaration had particularly great ambitions in economic and financial, political and security, social, cultural and human terms. As others have said before me, however, our partners have felt even more disappointed since this date: with very few association agreements and no agreements actually implemented yet, considerable amounts of European appropriations anticipated, but fewer allocated and still less actually paid, as all our partners keep telling us time and again.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally, moreover, the technical problems, the political problems, the limited direct investment, the inordinate debt of our partners are plain for all to see and to deplore. The results of all this are disastrous: the disillusionment of our partners, inadequate economic development, illegal immigration into Europe and a general upturn in fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary, as everyone this evening has said, to relaunch the Barcelona Process, to simplify its administrative procedures, to agree to open our European markets further and to cancel debts, all this in return for the necessary efforts of our partners in matters of human rights, and all this in the context of an overall Mediterranean vision which will have to ensure balance and peace between all the areas which, together, form the Euro-Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed we do not have any alternative, and I wish, this evening, to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for all the important and relevant information he has given us. As a Socialist, I therefore support the substance of the proposals included in our joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whatever our beliefs or religious convictions, we are forced to acknowledge that John Paul II’s message is a major contribution to progress towards peace in the region. In an area where pitfalls abound, in a context where every word and every gesture is weighed to assay its symbolic meaning, in Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories the Supreme Pontiff has found the right way to discuss persistent problems between the communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Holy Father shows us that the religious aspect of the conflicts cannot be disregarded, and that dialogue between religions is just as much a factor in stability as political dialogue. This visit has been an exceptional demonstration of the understanding that can be achieved between all parties. My feeling, on the occasion of this debate, is that it is worth paying tribute to the actions of this great man of peace, this indefatigable pilgrim.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask two questions of the Council and the Commission, the first on regional cooperation between the countries of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and the second on the role of the European Parliament in the Barcelona Process.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to regional cooperation – and the presidency has just answered this in part – the Union bases its Mediterranean policy on the Barcelona Process. This approach is supposed to be global and regional and treats the Mediterranean Basin as a regional entity. It is reasonable to think that cooperation between the Mediterranean States should be much stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns the role of the European Parliament, and it must be noted that, at present, it is too limited. So, as I pointed out, the Union’s Mediterranean policy is supposed to be global. The European Parliament is, in fact, only consulted on the occasion of bilateral agreements. It would be necessary either to reconcile the European Parliament with the Forum, along the lines of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, or to organise the more active and regular participation of the European Parliament in ministerial meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be filled with content and not emptied. It is essential that we strengthen political, economic and social ties and continue to move forward. We now have an association agreement with Morocco, in force since 2 March, which makes that country a privileged partner. However, there can be no close cooperation with Morocco without dealing with an activity – fishing – on which the economies of many European regions depend.</p>

<p class="contents">As has been said, a delegation from this Parliament has just visited Morocco and Tunisia. Human rights, the Western Sahara, fishing, agriculture, investment, MEDA and emigration were discussed by MEPs, the authorities and representatives of civil society. As a result, we have been asked to ensure that the Union has a greater political involvement in the Mediterranean. There are fears about enlargement and there is a feeling that the balance is more in favour of the north and the east and less in favour of the south. It would be good if the representatives of the Commission and the Council present here today could answer this question.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have to encourage investment in the region, and, respecting the idiosyncrasies of these countries we must cooperate with them so that they may make progress in their democratic processes and their respect for human rights. We must accept their pace but at the same time make it clear to them that the European Union does not only want to invest in economic development, but also in peace and stability, based on respect for peoples’ fundamental rights and on people being able to exercise their liberties in a democratic way.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an easy task, and only dialogue, and not confrontation, can achieve it. European Union actions are still very diffuse and complex in this area. The Barcelona Conference corresponds more to political will than to a genuine strategy aimed at creating a real Euro-Mediterranean area, where economics play an important part, but only one part, in a permanent dialogue and political cooperation in the social and cultural areas and also in the defence of mutual interests in order to guarantee the peace and stability which we all wish to see in this region.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want peace, and rightly so – the point has just been discussed – we want health, we want prosperity, we want efficient public services and we want social progress. Now, in my opinion, when you ask for everything – which it is always a good idea to do, just in case – the results are often unspectacular. I feel that we should carefully pinpoint the areas in which bilateral measures or Union interventions can be employed in the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If we choose wisely, there are certain sectors which would undoubtedly yield good results. Firstly, local government, which needs to be knocked into shape through privatisation, which has already begun in certain countries, and the provision of technology. Then, the health services, which we discussed only recently, which need to be improved through staff training, with technical staff being trained locally and specialised medical staff receiving the input of the European countries as well. Finally, heightening the intensity of inter-programme exchanges, as is specified by the MEDA programme, which has so far failed to materialise. With regard to this programme, with which I had to deal in various different contexts in committee, I have to say that I was disappointed at the difficulty of obtaining information and also of reporting that information and its implications to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission still has enough time: it has only been in place a few months, and so there is still time for it to invest energy in its work and to provide Parliament with more detailed information …</p>

<p class="contents">Today, we all agree that most of what was announced then has not been achieved. The reason behind those poor results is a combination of a lack of political will on the one hand, and lack of money on the other. I think we should place greater emphasis on Mediterranean policy, based on the diptych of democracy and development. Democracy in the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean because that will help us to understand one another, and development because, apart from anything else, development will reduce the flood of immigrants we have and will continue to have in years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission, then, must make every possible effort to reanimate the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership agreed at the Barcelona Conference. It is also important to give new impetus to the MEDA programmes and at the same time to strengthen programmes such as MEDA-Democracy, Euromed-Audiovisual, and sub-regional training programmes for journalists. Parliament has also long been proposing the implementation of a programme of interregional and transnational cooperation aimed, by effective financial and systematic coordination of the INTERREG and MEDA programmes, at achieving effective economic and social integration of the participating countries and regions on both sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to dwell on another issue which may not seem important to you, but which is important to me personally. I think that an important and catalytic role in ensuring the successful outcome of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must be played by the Mediterranean islands, such as Malta, Cyprus and Crete, as the middle ground between the two sides of the Mediterranean. Since those islands have traditional links with both sides, they can be the centres of that cooperation and I think we ought to direct many programmes in the context of MEDA towards that.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
