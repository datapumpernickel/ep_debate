<p>(EN) The Council informs the Honourable Member that various elements should be taken into account when setting a timetable for the lifting of border controls between the Member States which apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis with regard to border controls and the new Member States.</p>
<p>The Council would like to recall the provisions of the Act of Accession which foresees a two-stage implementation procedure, whereby certain provisions of the Schengen acquis, including those on external border controls, are binding and applicable from the date of accession to the European Union, whereas others, in particular those linked to the removal of checks at the internal borders are binding from the date of accession but only applicable in the new Member States once a Council decision to that effect is taken in accordance with Art. 3(2) of the Act of Accession.</p>
<p>This Decision will only be taken after having verified, in accordance with the Schengen evaluation procedures, that all necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the acquis concerned have been met in the new Member State and after having consulted the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the European Union with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, includes the Decision (SCH/Com-ex (98) 26 def) setting up a Committee called the Standing Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen which is to evaluate Member States before they apply the Schengen acquis in full and to monitor its application where it is already fully applied.</p>
<p>This Committee has been integrated into the working structures of the Council and comprises therefore experts from all Member States and the Commission. It will assess the situation in the new Member States with regard to their capacity to apply the Schengen acquis in full. These evaluations constitute an indispensable prerequisite for preparing a Council Decision on the lifting of controls at internal borders.</p>
<p>The new Member States have to inform the Council that they are ready to be evaluated by this Committee. An important element in this respect will be the state of readiness and the implementation of the new generation SIS, called SIS II.</p>
<p>Once these evaluations have been carried out, reports will be submitted to the Council which will serve as a basis for deciding on "opening the borders" between the new Member States and the Member States applying the Schengen acquis with regard to border control. The Council would like to point out that at present two of the "old Fifteen" Member States, i.e. the United Kingdom and Ireland, are not taking part in the frontiers provisions of the Schengen acquis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0315"></a>

<p>Dawit Isaak is a Swedish citizen who has been imprisoned without trial in Asmara, Eritrea, since 23 September 2001. Dawit Isaak is one of ten journalists working for private-sector media who were arrested in Asmara in September 2001. Isaak has been in jail for three years during which time the authorities have refused to try him before a court of law. Reportedly, no charges have yet been brought against Isaak for any offence against Eritrean law. His family in Sweden have not received any news of him and do not know whether he is alive. The Eritrean authorities have categorically refused to comment on the case.</p>
<p>In the hope that the Council is aware of the above situation, will the Council say what practical measures it will take and what pressure it will exert on behalf of Isaak Dawit and other EU citizens imprisoned in Eritrea? Can the suspension of aid - € 88 million over the period 2002-2007 - be used as a means of exerting pressure on the government and authorities in Asmara, given that the human rights situation in general in Eritrea is a cause for concern?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council shares the concern about the situation of Dawit Isaak and the other journalists who were arrested in September 2001. Since the restoration of political dialogue with Eritrea in May 2003, the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara have taken every opportunity to express their concern to the Eritrean authorities about the arbitrary detention of the group of arrested journalists and about the lack of information on their situation. Strong concerns have been expressed regarding the absence of any legal framework, rules or procedures for handling the case of these and other detainees, and EU Heads of Mission have insisted on receiving reassurances that the detainees are well treated.</p>
<p>The suspension of cooperation with Eritrea, following the opening of consultations with Eritrea under Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Cotonou agreement, has not been considered. These consultations should be seen in a broader perspective as they are geared not only towards the internal political situation, but also towards other important aspects like the peace process between Eritrea and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Council, at the level of its preparatory bodies, has requested the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara in September to include the issue of the detained journalists in the terms of reference for the next meeting with the Eritrean Government as part of the political dialogue or to carry out a separate demarche on this issue. As no date for the next political dialogue meeting has been fixed yet, the Presidency has addressed a letter to Eritrean President Isaias on the issue. In the letter, the Presidency expresses the EU’s concern at the detention of the journalists and calls for a transparent and fair process. Furthermore, the Presidency requests the Eritrean President to allow a mission of EU Heads of Mission to visit the journalists and other political detainees.</p>
<p>The Council intends to await an answer to this letter and include this in the political dialogue and will also otherwise continue to closely follow the situation of detained journalists in Eritrea.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0316"></a>

<p>(FR) The issue of promoting and facilitating the effective integration of third country nationals in host countries is certainly one of the most important issues in the discussions currently ongoing within the EU in the field of immigration. The Dutch Presidency has therefore decided to make it one of the priorities of its work programme in the area of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there is no Community policy on this issue because, given the highly specific character of each host country - connected in particular with its history, language and culture - the issue of integration remains within the competence of the Member States. Consequently, it has been deemed preferable to address this issue by laying down a range of common principles agreed by all Member States and able to direct and guide them in defining and implementing their integration policies. Those common principles are contained in draft Council and Member State Heads of Government conclusions, which are currently being examined in Council bodies and which are due to be adopted in one of the next Council meetings.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Commission, for its part, has already taken measures of its own in the area of integration. In June 2003, it tabled a communication – addressed to the Council, Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – on the subjects of immigration, integration and employment. Following that communication, the Commission set up a network of national contact points on integration which, through a series of meetings and seminars, were able to share information on the national regulations and practices regarding the subject. This information enabled the Commission to draw up an initial report on migration and integration, which was forwarded to the Council, Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions in July 2004.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission, with the help of the national contact points, is putting the finishing touches to a draft Good Practice Manual on integration following three conferences organised within the framework of the Integration of Third Country Nationals (INTI) programme. This manual will be presented by the Commission at the Ministerial Conference devoted to the immigration issue, which the Presidency is to hold on 9 to 11 November in Groningen.</p>
<p>It should finally be mentioned that explicit reference to integration is made in the draft Constitutional Treaty. Article III-168(4) states that ‘European laws or framework laws may establish measures to provide incentives and support for action of Member States with a view to promoting the integration of third-country nationals residing legally in their territories, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0318"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Security Strategy adopted by the European Council in December 2003 identifies effective multilateralism as the bedrock of EU foreign policy: “The development of a stronger international society, well functioning international institutions and a rule-based international order is our objective. We are committed to upholding and developing International Law. The fundamental framework for international relations is the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security”.</p>
<p>In this context, conflict prevention is important: “We need to be able to act before the countries around us deteriorate, when signs of proliferation are detected, and before humanitarian emergencies arise. Preventive engagement can avoid more serious problems in the future.”</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the main objective of the EU has always been to secure peace in Europe and to prevent future wars. The Council is working hard to bring peace and stability to its neighbourhood and has adopted inter alia the European Neighbourhood Policy to that aim. The Council is not aware of any threats to launch a preventive war against a Member State.</p>
<p>In its political dialogue with third countries, the EU is actively promoting effective multilateralism and an international rule of law. The EU and Russia have a strategic partnership. They cooperate in a full range of issues, reflecting Russia's important role as a partner in Europe, direct neighbour to the EU and strategic global actor. They have undertaken a number of steps, in particular post-9/11, to deal with the new global threats, including counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. In this cooperation the EU seeks to ensure that the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights are fully respected. The Council intends to continue to engage positively with Russia on these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0324"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has, in the past months, regularly discussed the issue evoked by the Honourable Parliamentarian. The alleged development of long-range ballistic missiles by Iran is a matter of serious concern for the international community because it contributes to destabilising the region and could also constitute a potential threat to all States within the range of the missiles. Therefore, the EU Member States apply robust export controls in accordance with the regulation guiding the export of dual use goods (EC 1334/2000) in order to prevent the transfer of sensitive equipment and technology to Iran.</p>
<p>Concerning the perceived risk of an Iranian capacity to develop nuclear weapons, the EU is working in all international fora, including at the IAEA in Vienna, to increase the pressure on Iran to fully co-operate with the IAEA in its inspection activities, and to be fully transparent on its nuclear programme. In addition, the EU is working to convince Iran to suspend, as a confidence building measure, all enrichment and reprocessing activities.</p>
<p>Most recently, on the occasion of the General Affairs Council meeting of 11 October 2004, Ministers' discussion on Iran focused on the nuclear issue. They exchanged views on the approach for the weeks ahead, including in the perspective of the AIEA Board of Governors meeting of 25 November.</p>
<p>The Presidency noted that the EU would remain engaged, notably through the efforts of France, Germany and the UK, reinforced by the Secretary General / High Representative for PESC, Javier Solana, with a view to achieving progress on the Iranian nuclear issue.</p>
<p>The Council informs the Honourable Parliamentarian that the inclusion of groups, individuals or entities in the list established pursuant to UNSCR 1373 are after careful consideration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0330"></a>

More specifically, the Council would like to remind you that various instruments have been adopted which aim to achieve that goal, such as Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment.</p>
<p>Since 1 May 2004, the Commission has had exclusive right of initiative in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters. To date, the Council has not received any proposals that accommodate the specific areas of concern that the honourable Member has raised.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would inform the honourable Member that it is now looking into the priorities which should be determined for the new multi-annual programme. These priorities should be finalised by no later than the beginning of November 2004, taking into account the position for which the European Parliament has given its seal of approval. It follows that it is impossible for the Council to indicate at this moment in time the priorities that will be determined in the near future. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0343"></a>

<p>(EN) On 5 July of this year, the Council adopted a Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing that an excessive deficit exists in Greece, and an accompanying Recommendation under Article 104(7) to Greece with a view to bringing to an end the situation of excessive deficit.</p>
<p>This is the standard procedure followed in all cases where the Council establishes that an excessive deficit exists in a Member State.</p>
<p>The text of that Council Recommendation has, in accordance with the wishes of the Greek government and with paragraph 6, addressed to the Member States, of the Resolution of the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, been made public. It calls upon the Greek authorities to put an end to the excessive deficit situation by 2005 at the latest and establishes a deadline of 5 November 2004 for the Greek government to take effective action to this end.</p>
<p>In the light of that deadline of 5 November, the ECOFIN Council is scheduled to review the situation of Greece at its meeting on 16 November. All formal steps in the excessive deficit procedure are based on Recommendations by the Commission, so any formal Council action would be dependent on an initiative by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Council will take account of all relevant factors in its analysis of Greece's response to its excessive deficit Recommendation, including the prudence of its macro-economic scenario and the ambition of its deficit adjustment path. However, it must be noted that the precise definition of the adjustment path and the content of the measures taken to meet it are left to the discretion of the individual Member State concerned.</p>
<p>The Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact provide for regular surveillance by both the Commission and Council of the budgetary situation of all Member States, with a possibility for additional surveillance of those with excessive deficits. The Council will address this and all other pertinent issues in its consideration of the situation in Greece at its meeting on 16 November.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The culpable silence, sanctimony and empty rhetoric on the part of the EU and UN equating the persecutor, the heavily-armed Israeli forces backed by a powerful nuclear arsenal, with the victim, the unarmed Palestinian people, effectively endorses the barbarity of the Israeli Government, characterised by daily Israeli army incursions, killings, the destruction of houses and the continued building of the 'wall of shame', with a view to perpetuating the invasion and occupation of territories and the genocide of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>(EN) At its meeting on 11 October 2004, the Council expressed its grave concern at the unprecedented cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the Occupied Territories. The Council reiterated its full and unconditional condemnation of all forms of terrorism, including rocket attacks into Israel (which resulted in the death of Israeli children), and called upon the Palestinian Authority to take firm action against the planners and perpetrators of such terrorist acts. While recognising that Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, the Council stressed that the exercise of this right should take place within the boundaries of international law. In particular as regards the recent Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip the Council condemned the disproportionate nature of these Israeli military actions which claimed the lives of many innocent civilians, including children, and left many injured.</p>

<p>(NL) On 11 October, the Council expressed its satisfaction at the adoption of Resolution 1565 of the UN Security Council, which further reinforces the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) and calls for a significant increase and improvement of MONUC’s capabilities, thus enabling it to fulfil the important tasks assigned to it. The Council has, in this connection, drawn the attention to the responsibility of the international community, including the regional actors, to pledge their unqualified support to the peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The Council has reiterated its conclusions of September about EU support and the UN’s efforts to reinforce MONUC, and underlines that the European Union and its Member States should now look into the contributions they could make to MONUC, the main focus of attention in this respect being the specific request in the UN Secretary General’s third report on MONUC. In this connection, the EU will, among others, pledge EU support to MONUC by providing it with access to the SATCEN (EU Satellite Centre) funds.</p>
<p>The Council has asked the competent Council authorities, on the basis of indications from the Member States and in close consultation with the relevant UN bodies, to start a clearing-house procedure in a bid, via a coordinated European response, to boost MONUC’s capabilities. The Council hopes to receive a report about the results of these efforts in November. Moreover, the Council has asked the competent Council authorities to examine whether the EU, whether or not as part of the ESDP, could do something in the area of police training and the reform of security bodies, one example being the integration and training of the army. The question as to whether they will contribute troops to MONUC must, however, ultimately be answered by the individual Member States themselves. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0350"></a>

<p>During the sitting of 4 March 2004, the Council adopted the joint Commission/Council report on the results of the review of the National Social Inclusion Plans 2003-2005. The report shows that Greece places social protection at the heart of its overall development strategy. The plan is to coordinate general policies – such as policies on economic growth and structural change – aimed at maintaining the rate of growth in social spending, and, at the same time, to draw up specific policies aimed at combating poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p>Stepping up social cohesion is one of the Lisbon Strategy’s core objectives, which include the modernisation of social systems in order to improve the way those systems work and in order to fight poverty more effectively and to increase social inclusion.</p>
<p>I wish to point out, moreover, that the mid-term review of the whole of the Lisbon Strategy will be the subject of a report by a group of experts chaired by Wim Kok, to be presented at the beginning of November.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Dutch Presidency recently held a round table on experiments carried out during the two stages of the action plans devoted to social inclusion. The purpose of this round table was to make a contribution towards evaluating the process of open coordination of policies connected with social inclusion. The Commission expressed its intention to evaluate this process in 2005.</p>

They are standing trial for demonstrating to claim their rights. This new wave of prosecutions of farmers proves not only the autocratic nature of the Greek government, but also its contempt for the farming community: it had promised before the elections to put an end to the prosecution of farmers so as to persuade them to vote for it, but eight months after it took office, as many farmers are being put on trial as before.</p>

<p>(EN) Similar to what was agreed in earlier enlargements, the Accession Treaty foresees a transitional period for the free movement of workers for the eight countries of Central and Eastern Europe that joined the EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>It foresees a two-year period during which national measures will be applied by the EU-15 Member States, which can include specific bilateral agreements or can de facto result in full market labour access. After this period, reviews will be held, and, depending on the outcome, such national measures can continue to apply for a maximum of three more years, after which the transitional arrangement should in principle come to an end. Only in exceptional and serious cases will an EU-15 Member State be able to continue to apply national measures up to the end of the seventh year after accession. The Council underlines that the EU-15 Member States must give preference to nationals from the eight new Member States concerned over non-EU labour and stresses the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the arrangement for the free movement of workers. EU-15 Member States must endeavour to grant increased labour market access to nationals from these eight new Member States concerned under national law, with a view to speeding up the approximation to the acquis.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the employment opportunities in the EU for nationals from the eight new Member States to which the transitional arrangement applies should improve substantially upon their accession, including for the professions referred to by the Honourable Member. However, it should again be noted that, during the transitional period, it is the Member States that decide on national measures, which can include bilateral agreements, quotas, or full liberalisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0332"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission proposes adopting texts aimed at increasing legal certainty for undertakings entrusted with public service missions and receiving financial support for this purpose from the Member States. The Commission has drawn up a draft Commission decision on the basis of Article 86(3) of the Treaty and a draft Community framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation. The purpose of those drafts is to specify the conditions under which Member States can award public service compensation constituting State aid in accordance with Community rules on State aid. The decision on the basis of Article 86(3) will, in particular, make it possible to exempt from prior notification those compensation projects the amounts for which are below thresholds to be established. The Commission also plans to extend the benefit of this decision to hospitals and to social housing undertakings.</p>
<p>In particular, the aforementioned drafts follow up broad public consultation organised by the Commission on the basis of its Green Paper on services of general interest in Europe. The Commission decided to submit these drafts to Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions for their opinions. The Committee of the Regions adopted an opinion at its meeting of 29 September 2004. The Commission is awaiting the opinions of Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p>Experts from Member States were consulted on those draft texts in April 2004, and a fresh meeting might be held in 2005, should this prove necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission also put the draft texts on the Competition Directorate-General’s website so that any interested third parties might submit their comments.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is glad to be given the opportunity to present its position on the problem of cetacean bycatch in pair trawling for bass, which attracted significant attention in the press recently.</p>
<p>The Commission indeed received a UK request in July for an emergency closure of the bass fishery using pelagic pair trawls in the Western Channel, on the grounds that current levels of by-catch may constitute a threat to the common dolphin population. After having carefully scrutinised this request, the Commission decided to reject it.</p>
<p>This is because the Commission believes that the legal requirements justifying recourse to the emergency procedure foreseen in Article 7 of Regulation 2371/2002 on the Common Fisheries Policy were not fulfilled. The sea bass pair trawl fishery takes place during the winter, with a marked concentration of fishing effort in February and March. Its immediate closure by way of a Commission emergency procedure did not appear justified, whatever the merits of the case, given that normal Community procedures, following consultation of scientific experts and all interested parties, would allow time for the adoption of any necessary measure before the main period of this fishery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the immediate action proposed by the United Kingdom was in the Commission’s view unlikely to achieve the desired goal. According to the evidence available, a prohibition on the use of pair trawl to target sea bass in the Western Channel could simply result in a redistribution of fishing effort either into other fisheries in the same area or into adjacent areas, without necessarily reducing the by-catch of dolphins. The background information accompanying the UK request did not provide radically new evidence on the appropriateness of the measure. The need for a comprehensive monitoring of the numerous trawl fisheries active in this region before being precise about mitigation requirements has been recognised by the Parliament and endorsed by the Council earlier this year, when in April it adopted Regulation No 812/2004 laying down a set of measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries. This comprehensive monitoring will begin on 1 January next.</p>
<p>This being said, the Commission shares the concerns to take appropriate measures to limit cetacean by-catch and is committed to working towards a solution of this problem in close cooperation with all interested parties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0285"></a>

<p>On the eve of, and after, the football match between the European Champions, Greece, and Albania in Tirana on 4 September 2004, Fatos Nano, the Prime Minister of Albania, made unprecedented remarks stoking fanaticism and influencing passions among Greeks and Albanians, while on 9 September he condemned Greeks for their 'racism and xenophobia'. These remarks were made despite the fact that it is well known that at least 1.5 million Albanians have arrived in Greece (legally or illegally), live and work in that country and send valuable foreign exchange back home to Albania. In the meantime, members of the Greek ethnic minority in Dervitsani in Northern Epirus have complained that their houses were fired at by Albanians after the end of the football game in question and for days afterwards.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>(EN) With reference to the questions raised by the Honourable Member the Commission would like to point out the following:</p>
<p>1. No specific legal framework has been established to protect the national character of sport in the twenty-five Member States. The application of the Community rules on the free movement of workers to sport is not dealt with in any specific Community legal provision, but is the result of the settled case law of the European Court of Justice<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Court held that sport was subject to Community law in so far as it constituted an economic activity, whether by professional or amateur athletes. The Court furthermore underlined that only rules concerning questions of purely sporting interest, and which as such, have nothing to do with economic activity, were not subject to the Community provisions in respect of the freedom of movement of persons and services.<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> In fact such regulations, which relate to the particular nature and context of sporting events, are inherent in the organisation and proper conduct of sporting competition and cannot be regarded as constituting a restriction on the Community rules on the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to provide services. Where a sporting activity takes the form of gainful employment it will come, more particularly, within article 39 of the Treaty (ex article 48) and the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality contained in articles 12 and 39 will apply. In addition article 7(4) of Regulation 1612/68 on freedom of movement will apply, so that collective agreements or any regulations concerning employment must be non-discriminatory. This is the case whether such agreements emanate from public authorities or private bodies.</p>
<p>The Court held in its judgement of 15 December 1995 in case C-415/93 - Bosman<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and in subsequent judgements that professional football was clearly an economic activity to which the Treaty could apply. The Court held that the transfer fee system was incompatible with article 39 of the Treaty. In addition, it held that article 39 precluded rules which limited the number of professional players from other Member States who could play in football competitions.</p>
<p>2. On the basis of the Bosman ruling, FIFA has modified its regulations on the Status and Transfer of players after long discussions with the Commission. One of the main issues at stake was to find an appropriate balance between the player’s fundamental right to free movement and stability of contracts between football clubs and players in the specific context of sport. The outcome of the discussions was announced on 5 May 2001 following a meeting of the Members of the Commission with responsibility for Employment and Social Affairs, Competition, and Education and Culture with FIFA and UEFA. As a result, the new FIFA rules governing international transfers of football players became applicable on 1 September 2001. In case of disagreements on the application of these rules, the Commission would encourage, whenever possible, that these be addressed in the first instance, by the relevant sporting organisations bodies and if no solution is found, be put to national courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission refers the Honourable Member to its statement in the plenary session of the European Parliament -Strasbourg, 11 March 2004- on the effects on the marine environment of low-frequency active sonar. This statement recalled the strict protection status of cetaceans in EU waters and informed the Parliament that the Commission has requested the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to undertake a scientific review on this issue. This is considered as an essential basis for determining possible future actions needed to avoid cetacean disturbance, ensuring compliance with Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>This scientific review has been launched and draft conclusions are expected early in 2005. The Commission will make the results of this review available and will discuss with Member States in the Habitats Committee the best ways to protect cetaceans against sonar and other types of noise disturbance. Stakeholders will also be associated to these discussions.</p>
<p>In relation to the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member about the stranding of cetaceans on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote beaches, the Commission has received a study in relation to this case by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in July 2004.</p>

<p>there were 2 appointments to Director-General or equivalent functions of personnel who were in Cabinets. These appointments concerned Commission officials, of grade A*15 and A*14 respectively;</p>
<p>there were 7 appointments of personnel who were working in Cabinets at the level of Director or equivalent functions. Of these, five appointments took place after internal publication and two appointments following an external publication.</p>

<p>(EN) Concerning the Community proposal, the total amount which was submitted directly to the Montreal Protocol and requested by these Member States was 4,577 tonnes which equates to 23.7% of the total amount of methyl bromide that was consumed for controlled uses in 1991 in the European Community. Consumption in 1991 is regarded as the ‘base level’ as all the reduction steps required by developed countries are relative to this 1991 base level.</p>
<p>Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 on ‘Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ limits the amount of methyl bromide that can be placed on the EC market in 2004 to 4,813 tonnes. The amount requested for critical uses in 2005 was 4.9% less than the amount permitted to be consumed in 2004. Since the quantity requested for critical uses is less than the previous year, this could be considered ‘phasing out’ (albeit rather minimal) rather than ‘phasing in’ methyl bromide.</p>
<p>As regards the international exemptions, at the Nairobi Meeting of the Parties, eight parties asked for more than 20% of their base level including five Parties that asked for more than 25% of their base level. The United States requested the Parties to approve 39% of its base level. The amount of methyl bromide requested by the United States alone exceeded to total amount of methyl bromide requested by all the other Parties combined.</p>
<p>The European Community, including many developing countries that have made significant progress in the phase out of methyl bromide, could not agree to the request submitted by the United States. The European Community considered that the environmental intent of the Montreal Protocol was not to allow production of methyl bromide that would exceed 30% of a Party’s base level since any more would be considered ‘phasing in’ rather than ‘phasing out’ methyl bromide.</p>
<p>Because the Parties could not agree, the negotiations broke down and an Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties was scheduled for March 2004 where discussions resumed. Agreement was reached on a 30% limit for any production of methyl bromide necessary to satisfy critical uses and, in addition, the Parties agreed a number of decisions that would encourage the phase out of methyl bromide for critical uses.</p>
<p>As regards the last question, there is no legal basis in the Montreal Protocol or Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 for limiting the amount of methyl bromide for critical uses. Therefore it is unnecessary to make any revision of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 to take account of decisions agreed by the Parties on the amount of methyl bromide that can be produced in the EC to satisfy critical uses of methyl bromide.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1) The rail / road axis Ireland / UK / Continental Europe (project n. 26). Co-financing under the TEN-T programme applies respectively to two road sections between Cork-Dublin and Belfast, expected to be accomplished by 2004 and 2005, as well as to the upgrading of the rail between Cork-Dublin and Belfast, expected to be accomplished by 2008.</p>
<p>2) Sea Motorways of the West of Europe. Motorways of the Sea are a Community initiative to achieve modal shift and better links to islands and outlying regions by consolidating traffic flows in a high quality intermodal chain based on short sea shipping. The Commission has launched a consultation of interested parties on the execution of motorways of the sea projects under the TEN programme by means of a consultation document published on 30 July 2004, to which also the Irish Government has responded. The Commission will take into account all comments received when drafting the call for the selection procedure 2005.</p>
<p>The fact that a project is on the TEN-T makes it eligible for Community co-financing. Any specific financial support from the Commission will have to be requested for by the Irish Government, meeting the requirements of EC Regulation N° 807/2004<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, signed by the Parliament and the Council on 21 April 2004.</p>
<p>In the context of the new financial perspective (2007-2013), the Commission is proposing to increase substantially the EU financial support for priority projects like the ones referred to above, with higher co-financing rates (up to 30%). This proposal is currently being examined by the Parliament and Council.</p>
<p>In addition to the TEN-T financing, the West of Ireland is in receipt of significant funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund for the upgrading of its transport infrastructure, in the domains of both road and public transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Lisbon strategy – as defined by the European Council in March 2000 – was meant to support the then current dynamism through a stronger competitiveness.</p>
<p>The Competition policy has been identified as one of the major pillars of this strategy, since it has to create a common playing field for economic activities throughout the Union. In this respect, the Commission has put the emphasis on several key priorities to support the achievement of our goals in the competition area.</p>
<p>State aid reduction</p>
<p>At Lisbon, the Council, Commission and Member States were requested “to further their efforts to promote competition and reduce the general level of State aids”. At the Stockholm European Council, Member States undertook a commitment to demonstrate a downward trend in State aid in relation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission’s latest State aid Scoreboard<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> confirms that by and large Member States are on the right track. The overall level of State aid<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> granted by the fifteen Member States in 2002 was estimated at €49 billion or 0.56% of GDP. Following the dramatic fall in the overall volume of aid during the late 1990s, total aid has continued to decline though less sharply than in previous years, falling on average at just over €1 billion per year over the period 2000 to 2002. Disparities between Member States still exist but are diminishing and virtually all Member States are in line with the Stockholm commitment.</p>
<p>State aid reorientation</p>
<p>The other commitment undertaken by Member States at Stockholm concerns the redirection of aid away from sectoral aids (which by their nature tend to be more distorting) towards horizontal aid which is usually aimed at correcting identified market failures. Here again the results are encouraging. Around 73% of total aid (less agriculture fisheries and transport) in 2002 was granted for horizontal objectives including Research &amp; Development, SMEs, environment and regional economic development. The remaining 27% was aid directed at specific sectors (mainly manufacturing, coal and financial services) including aid for rescue and restructuring. It is worth noting that while some Member States have regularly awarded aid to rescue and restructure ailing firms (e.g., Germany, France and Italy) others have clearly not had such a policy.</p>
<p>The share of aid granted for horizontal objectives increased by 7 percentage points over the period 2000 to 2002. This was largely the result of significant increases in aid for the environment (+7 points) and research and development (+4 points). This positive trend was observed, to varying degrees, in the majority of Member States. Indeed, in several Member States - Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Austria and Finland – virtually all the aid awarded in 2002 was earmarked for horizontal objectives, including cohesion.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Member States efforts to reduce and redirect aid, the cumulative effect of €49 billion of State aid still has a considerable distortive effect on competition in the Internal Market. As well as the need to minimise distortion to competition, the grant of aid must also be balanced against constraints on national public finances. In this context, Member States have begun to exchange information on ongoing efforts to reduce and redirect aid and to evaluate the effectiveness of State aid measures.</p>
<p>Public procurement</p>
<p>Public procurement markets have become more transparent since the Lisbon Summit. The percentage of public procurement advertised in the Official Journal has increased by almost 70% between 1999 and 2002<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This increase was especially significant in Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria and the United Kingdom. A study of the Commission has also shown that up to 78% of the successful firms being awarded a contract (the value of which is) above the thresholds set by Directives are SMEs<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, with the percentage ranging from 65% in the UK to 92% in Luxembourg. This is encouraging as the access of SMEs to public procurement can be seen as an important indicator of the openness of public procurement.</p>
<p>The new public procurement directives were adopted after a long gestation period. The implementation of these directives is not only expected to boost transparency and to further develop cross-border business activity but more particularly to contribute significantly to the improvement of the efficiency of public spending. In a sample of products surveyed in another Commission study, the application of procurement rules appears to reduce prices by around 30%<a href="#defann_30_5" name="refann_30_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. If hypothetical savings equivalent to 10% of public procurement spending would be achieved, all Member States would conveniently meet the Stability and Growth Pact<a href="#defann_30_6" name="refann_30_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Services sector</p>
<p>Services account for around 70% of economic activity in the EU; Intra EU-trade in services as a percentage of GDP is lower today than it was 10 years ago. Services also account for 60-70% of employment in all Member States; between 1997 and 2002, 96% of all job creation in the EU was in services, representing 11.4m new jobs. A wide range of legal and administrative barriers inhibit cross-border trade in services, (including permanent establishment in another Member State); the barriers are similar across services sectors; many barriers are prima facie incompatible with the Treaty.</p>
<p>Services are everywhere in the economy, as final services delivered to consumers and businesses and as inputs to manufacturers and other service providers; as a result, a barrier to the provision of a single service has effects throughout the supply chain and throughout the economy</p>
<p>The Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive on Services in the Internal Market on 13 January 2004.</p>
<p>The objective of the proposal is to create a better functioning Internal Market for Services. It seeks to create a well-balanced European legal framework aiming to facilitate the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. Exercising the freedom of establishment will be easier because of administrative simplification, including the modernisation of authorisation schemes and the removal or evaluation of a number of specified requirements. Exercising the freedom to provide services will be made easier by the country of origin principle (coupled with derogations), as well as specific provisions governing the rights of recipients of services and administrative co-operation.</p>
<p>The proposal covers a wide range of different services provided as an economic activity to consumers and to businesses. The Commission estimates that the services covered by the proposal account for some 50% of EU GDP and for some 60% of employment in the Union, though an exact figure is hard to determine as many services are provided by manufacturers of goods and thus not caught by available statistics.</p>
<p>With the report on competition in professional services on 9 February 2004, the Commission has highlighted an area in particular where restrictions to competition are still high. While the Commission acknowledges that some regulation in this sector is justified, it believes that in some cases more pro competitive mechanisms can and should be used instead of certain traditional restrictive rules. Ultimately, in all scrutiny of professional regulation a proportionality test should be applied, in order to ensure that these regulations truly fulfil their objective. The Commission therefore invites the regulatory authorities in the Member States and the professional bodies to review existing rules, taking into consideration whether those rules are necessary and proportionate to achieve a public interest objective, and whether they are necessary for good practice of the profession. The Commission will report on progress in 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the floods that have occurred this summer in Finland.</p>
<p>However, the Structural Fund programmes implemented in Finland during the current programming period 2000-2006 have not foreseen a funding reserve for damages caused by natural disasters nor have the Finnish rural development programmes foreseen the possibility to fund the measure, provided by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), enabling to restore agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and to introduce appropriate prevention instruments. Besides, the Commission has not received a request to modify any of these programmes.</p>
<p>The EU Solidarity Fund can provide assistance in the event of a major disaster under certain conditions, e.g. threshold for damages € 3 billion, and in exception cases also when more specific criteria apply. The EU Solidarity Fund is limited to help finance public expenditure related to the disaster and may not be used to compensate private losses. So far Finland has not submitted any application for funding from the Solidarity Fund either.</p>
<p>However, in 2001 Finland notified the Commission a national State aid to compensate for the loss caused by flood<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which was approved by Commission<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

The overall EU engagement in policing comprises an European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) police mission, PROXIMA, and a project funded through EC Community assistance for reconstruction, development and stabilisation programme (CARDS) assistance focusing on the provision of strategic advice for the implementation of the Government’s police reform strategy which was developed with expert advice under previous EC-funded activities.</p>
<p>The government has also adopted an integrated border management strategy developed with EC assistance, which is currently under implementation. It is working closely with the Commission on a comprehensive judicial reform strategy which is being finalised. Ongoing and programmed EC assistance efforts are directed towards developing an increased independency of the judiciary, a more effective courts system, easier access to justice and enhanced legal certainty.</p>
<p>Further projects funded through the CARDS programme aim at supporting the development of an effective anti-money laundering capacity and combating financial crimes. A major programme of support for the reform of the customs administration is currently being implemented (Customs and Fiscal Administration Office – CAFAO-MAK).</p>
<p>An underlying objective of our approach is that of addressing the root causes of corruption through the combined action of different programmes.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting the EU is only supporting and providing advice in the context of a process whose ownership remains firmly with the country’s authorities.</p>
<p>The EU engagement has proved effective so far in generating a degree of political commitment towards the reform process and concrete practical results. However, much remains to be done and many structural and legislative weaknesses need to be overcome.</p>
<p>The EU will remain engaged and continue to support the country’s reform efforts and monitoring its progress in this crucial area of cooperation in the coming years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that EU citizens and business must have confidence in the EU legal framework if they are to maintain a positive view of the Community. The free movement provisions of the Treaty are fundamental to the EU and are amongst the major benefits of membership. Accordingly, the Commission places the highest priority on maintaining the integrity of the Internal Market and carefully investigates all complaints in exactly the same way, irrespective of where they come from or which Member State they concern.</p>
<p>As far as the free movement of capital is concerned, the Commission is unaware of instances in which Polish firms in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany or other Member States have been discriminated against. No such complaints have been brought to the Commission's attention by parties concerned.</p>
<p>As far as the free movement of services is concerned, the Commission will write to the relevant Member States and request further information on the alleged breaches of EC law. On the basis of the information received, the Commission will assess the situation in each Member State and decide whether to start infringement procedures. More in general, the Commission is well aware from its work in the context of the Internal Market Strategy for Services that service providers from all Member States face considerable problems when attempting to do business across borders in the EU. The scale and range of barriers to service provision across all Member States is such that the Commission concluded that infringement procedures alone would not be sufficient to achieve a well-functioning Internal Market in services. Accordingly, in January 2004, the Commission proposed a Directive on Services to address many of these barriers. It will be important that the Parliament examines this proposal as efficiently as possible in order for the Directive to be approved during 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the SOLVIT network, which is operational in all 25 Member States. This network deals with problems caused by the misapplication of Internal Market law by public authorities. The aim of SOLVIT, which is free of charge, is to solve such problems quickly and informally, thus avoiding lengthy and costly legal proceedings at national or Community level. The SOLVIT centres in each Member State’s administration work together and are committed to finding a solution within 10 weeks. If Polish firms take their complaints forward through the SOLVIT system and their problems remain unresolved, or if they consider that the proposed solutions are unacceptable, they can still pursue legal action through a national court or lodge a formal complaint with the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0314"></a>

<p>Whereas Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> does allow for derogations from the strict protection regime applying to wild birds these must be in accordance with the conditions specified in the Directive, including the absence of other satisfactory solutions. One of the possible justifications for use of derogations is ‘for the protection of flora and fauna’, which may include the protection of ‘feral pigeons’. It is Member States who decide on whether to apply a derogation under the Directive, the use of which must be reported to Commission.</p>
<p>However, in considering the use of a derogation Member States would need to take full account of the primary objective of the Directive to conserve wild birds and not be damaging to the conservation status of the species affected by the derogation. Any use of a derogation would also need to be fully justified scientifically. It would need to be targeted to the specific problem and proportionate in its application.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the populations of many birds of prey in the European Union are still comparatively rare and sensitive to human activities.

<p>In its reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2004-1613_EN.html">E-1613/04</a> the Commission has finally admitted that it cannot distinguish between deep-sea species and demersal species. To date, no list of vessels authorised to carry out deep sea fishing under Regulation (EC) 2347/2002<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> exists, or if it does, it has not been published. Regulation (EC) 1954/2003<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> revoked the main instrument for monitoring fishing effort, namely the effort registers. The same Regulation also revoked all the restrictions on fishing gear (bottom trawls, bottom gill nets, regulations on hooks) which had existed in the Azores Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>In practice, the Commission has virtually eliminated all forms of monitoring and safeguarding the Atlantic seabed, thus further encouraging the destruction of resources already largely devastated in international waters, but was still safeguarded in the Azores Autonomous Region. Does the Commission intend to change its policy in response to the urgent needs of the real situation, or is its preferred course simply to wait until the time arrives to write the epitaph for the deep-sea natural resources of the Atlantic Ocean?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As regards the reply given by the Commission to the written question 1613/04 that the Honourable Member refers to, it did not say that the Commission cannot distinguish between deep-sea species and demersal species. What it quite clearly said was that the Commission does not keep defined lists of which species are pelagic and demersal, respectively, simply because the distinction between the two groups is self-evident both as regards the difference in biology of the species and the different nature of the fisheries. It has never been found to be necessary to establish such lists and there is no change to that assessment at present; however, should there arise any uncertainties in the future the Commission would review the need for it.</p>
<p>When it comes to deep-sea species, it is perfectly clear from the Annexes to Council Regulation 2347/2002 which deep-sea species are covered by that Regulation. These same species are excluded from the scope of the Western waters Regulation, 1954/2003, to avoid an overlapping of management measures which would create legal ambiguity. As concerns the lists of vessels, there is no obligation for Member States under Regulation 2347/2002 to send in lists of vessels that have been given a deep-sea fishing permit, and hence no publication of such lists is foreseen.</p>
<p>As regards Regulation 1954/2003, it does not revoke the effort monitoring system but it replaces the old system from 1995 with a new one which is consistent with the new legal situation after 2002 when the transitional measures for Spain and Portugal came to an end. The new system is intended to avoid any increase in fishing effort in Western waters as well as any major shift of fishing effort between large fishing areas. Restrictions in the use of fishing gear are not dealt with in this Regulation, because these issues fall under the technical measures Regulation 850/98. The Commission has indeed proposed an amendment to the latter Regulation in order to prohibit the use of bottom trawls in sensitive areas around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Moreover, in order to avoid any risk of damage in these areas while the legislative procedures are going on, including the deliberations of European Parliament, the Commission has also proposed an amendment to the TAC and Quota Regulation for this year which would implement the ban on a provisional basis until such time that the amendment to 850/98 has been adopted.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission cannot agree with the Honourable Member that the Commission has eliminated all forms of monitoring and safeguarding of the Atlantic seabed. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, there is a whole series of measures on conservation of resources and marine habitats in the Atlantic, including the waters around the Azores. These measures consist mainly of TACs and quotas, technical measures and effort limitation schemes. If there are further conservation measures that the Honourable Member would like to suggest, the Commission is, as always, open to have a constructive discussion. As already said on a number of occasions, the Commission does not believe that limiting access is a conservation measure. Limited access is a socio-economic measure to the benefit of coastal regions and outermost regions, which will not in itself guarantee any conservation effects. In order to achieve the conservation objectives that we have set for ourselves, we should use the appropriate measures available under the Common Fisheries Policy mentioned before.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission focuses its cooperation with Colombia on improving the respect for human rights, alleviating the humanitarian crisis, and on the support to grassroots peace initiatives (the so-called ‘Peace Laboratories’).</p>
<p>In Colombia, the Commission is working on these issues both with the civil society (notably NGOs e.g. for humanitarian assistance) and with the Colombian Government, in keeping with the objective of ‘ownership’ of the EC cooperation activities by the partner state. For instance in 2004 the Commission approved a project worth € 10.5 million aiming at reducing impunity through the reform of the Colombian justice sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly stressed the importance of taking early and effective action against collusion between elements of the Colombian security forces with paramilitary groups. Projects that we support through the European initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (notably prominent Colombian human rights defenders) contribute to that objective. The AUC paramilitaries (United Self-defence of Colombia, AUC) were added to the so-called ‘EU terrorist list’ on 2 May 2002.</p>
<p>By definition, our ‘Peace Laboratories’ project are implemented in conflictive areas where illegal armed groups are present. The objective of these ‘Peace Laboratories’ is precisely to defuse the conflict in these areas and foster democratic alternatives towards the resolution of structural socio-economic problems. The Commission is aware of the risks that illegal armed actors may try and exert influence on the processes brought about by the initiatives it supports. However, the Commission selects its partners after a cautious and transparent consultation process involving all the main stakeholders. The experience so far with the first ‘Peace Laboratory’ (in the Magdalena Medio region) has been positive.</p>
<p>After having looked into the matter, the Commission has found no element corroborating the allegation referred to by the Honourable Member that Mr. Euser Rondón would have been associated in any manner with the Community assistance cooperation programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0327"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU has indeed sought commitments from a number of partners on the services related to water (such as distribution of water or wastewater management), as part of its wider negotiating proposal on environmental services. However, it is important to stress that the EC requests on water distribution clearly exclude any cross-border transportation either by pipeline or by any other means of transport, nor do they seek access to water resources. Moreover, they do not undermine or reduce in any way the host governments' ability to regulate water management and allocation among users, to choose whether and how the private sector may participate in the delivery of water and sanitation services and to impose equitable pricing policies and ensure affordability for the poor. In addition, the requests take into account the level of development of our trading partners. Developing, and in particular least developed countries, are not expected to open their market to foreign competition to the same extent, and at the same pace, as more developed countries. In this regard, developing guidelines on water related services has not been an option explored until now, in order not to prejudge the flexibility left to developing countries in particular to regulate this sensitive sector. The EC has and will continue to support developing countries in this respect, including through the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU remains committed to the Millennium Development Goal target to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water, and to the targets agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation and for countries to have integrated water resource management and efficiency plans by 2005.

<p>(EN) The European Community has put adequate measures in place for the protection of the seals in the European Union. All seal species, which are also to be commonly found along the Norwegian coast, are listed under the Habitats Directive, either benefiting from a very strict protection system or requiring the establishment of appropriate monitoring and surveillance systems to ensure that the taking in the wild as well as their exploitation is compatible with their being maintained at a favourable conservation status.</p>
<p>As regards trade with third countries, Council Directive 83/129/EEC prohibits the import of products derived from the pups of whitecoat harp seals and hooded seals (blue-backs) into the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the Norwegian government amended its legislation in June 2004 to permit foreign nationals to take part in hunting for coastal seals. According to the Norwegian authorities, this measure would give hunting for coastal seals the same status as hunting for terrestrial mammals.</p>
<p>An import into the EU of products of the harp seal pups, a species which is found in Norway, would be prohibited under the scope of Directive Council Directive 83/129/EEC.</p>
<p>Since seals are migratory species, the Commission services will follow the development of seal hunting in Norway to determine if there is any detrimental impact on the seals population in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0344"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers its macroeconomic scenario to be more realistic than that of the Greek government. The latter scenario considers that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow at 3.9% in 2005, while the Commission projects growth at 3.3%.</p>
<p>The unemployment problem of Greece is mainly of a structural nature. Therefore, fiscal policy is not at the core of the labour market problems in Greece. Within the framework of the Broad economic policy guidelines (BEPGs), the Council recommended the Greek authorities to: a) Improve work incentives, particularly in tax and pension systems, in order to encourage increased employment in the formal sector, including part-time work; b) Promote changes to the wage bargaining system with a view to ensure that wages reflect productivity differentials; and c) Implement the labour reform package to improve the balance between flexibility and security by ensuring effective implementation of reforms aiming to modernise work organisation and by reviewing unduly restrictive labour market regulations.</p>
<p>As far as the budgetary adjustment is concerned, in its recommendations under Article 104 (7) of the Treaty the Council recommended the Greek authorities to reduce the excessive deficit below 3% of GDP in 2005 at the latest and to distribute the total adjustment over 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances in the face of population ageing, especially in view of the high government debt ratio, the Council, also in the framework of the BEPGs, recommends the Greek authorities to move towards achieving a medium-term close to balance or in surplus position through effective control of current primary spending. Action taken by the Greek authorities in this field is assessed on an annual basis within the framework of the implementation report, as well as in the assessment of the Stability Programme. Furthermore, the Council in accordance with Article 104 (7) of the Treaty and to Regulation 1467/97 (On speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure) recommended the Greek authorities on 5 July 2004 to undertake measures of structural nature to reduce the excessive deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value by 2005 at the latest. The Council also recommended the Greek authorities to reduce the debt ratio at a satisfactory pace and to correct the serious deficiencies revealed in the process of validating the EDP notification. The Greek government should announce/implement corrective measure by 5 November 2004. If Greece has not taken effective actions in response to recommendations by then, the Commission would take additional steps within the excessive deficit procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0346"></a>

<p>The Commission’s fourth report on the implementation of that regulation, dated 24 April 2002<a href="#defann_48_3" name="refann_48_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, says, on this question, that the liberalisation of previously protected services to maritime cabotage on 1 January 1999 did not lead to significant penetration of national markets by vessels flying the flag of other Member States. This was particularly true in Greece, not least due to its geographical position and to the competitiveness of its fleet. Nevertheless, the quality of the services provided appears to have improved, which has in turn led to increased traffic in some countries.</p>
<p>The Commission has no doubt that this liberalisation, which has not, in fact, been implemented in full in Greece, will produce all the expected benefits in that country.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the provisions contained in the above-mentioned Regulation as regards crew and public service are intended to play a moderating role.</p>

Does the Commission consider its package of measures adequate? Does it assume that part of the European textile industry will be destroyed no matter what happens?

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the situation of the textiles and clothing industry as well as its economic importance in terms of employment and industrial output.</p>
<p>The precise impact of abolishing quotas cannot be assessed but could be considerable. It will depend on how industry and the national and regional public authorities respond with policies to make their textile industry competitive. In general, the long term impact of quota removal is likely to vary greatly depending on country conditions and domestic policy responses.</p>
<p>There may be substitution effect among suppliers to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of products, economies of scale, competitive prices as well as efficient services. Given the massive industry in place and the enormous amount of capacity still under construction, China is forecast to be on the top of the list, most probably at the expenses of other developing countries more than of EU Textile and Clothing (T&amp;C) industry. This is exactly the reason why specific provisions had been included in China’s protocol accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As regards the possible use of safeguards, it should be considered only if and when the legal conditions are met, and as a last resort. The Commission intends therefore to issue guidelines regarding the criteria for the implementation of the safeguard clause. This should lead to the clarification of the rules of procedure for complaints or requests for safeguards by the industry and criteria that the Commission intend to follow, in conformity with the relevant Regulations adopted by the Council, for the application of safeguard clauses and in particular for the textiles-specific safeguard clause set out in China’s Protocol of Accession to the WTO.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission also intends to put in place a system of monitoring of China’s textiles imports into the EU on the basis of an automatic import licences system that will allow to follow up the developments of the market almost in real time as per January 1 and contribute to determining swiftly if the conditions for the use of the above clause are met.</p>
<p>Concerning the package of measures the Commission has been preparing to face these challenges raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission wishes to draw attention to the textile communication adopted on 13 October 2004 entitled “Textile and Clothing after 2005 - Recommendations of the High Level Group for textiles and clothing”, where the Commission builds on the work carried out by the High Level Group in which Members of the Parliament participated and proposes several actions to enhance the competitiveness of the European textile industry in a fair post-ATC (Agreement on Textile and Clothing) environment. Obviously, the Commission shares the concerns expressed that China’s export potential could put the EU industry under strain. In this connection it wishes to point out that it is monitoring closely China’s compliance with its WTO accession commitments, most notably in the framework of the textile EU-China dialogue set up on 6 May 2004 by the Commissioner in charge of Trade and his Chinese counterpart Trade minister Bo Xilai.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0354"></a>

<p>It is greatly to be feared that if the above document is taken as the legislative basis for the reform of the COM in sugar - and if, in particular, the national quotas A and B are merged and each Member State's overall quota is reduced by 16% - an immense amount of damage will be done and many competitive sugarbeet farmers and sugar manufacturers (especially ones in the new Member States) will be driven into bankruptcy.

<p>Does the Commission realise that by acting in such a fashion it would deprive the above-mentioned Member States (in particular the Czech Republic) of their self-sufficiency and make them dependent on imports of more expensive sugar from abroad, whereas the countries in question are capable of manufacturing high-quality sugar cheaply and would be fully competitive if a level playing-field existed?

<p>(EN) The reform proposal of the Commission as laid down in its Communication on the reform of the European sugar sector of 14 July 2004 aims at achieving better market orientation and higher competitiveness of this sector in line with the general objectives of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform whilst taking into consideration the constraints deriving from international commitments on the EU sugar market.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives in a single market it is key that the current system of repartitioning of production over all Member States is reconsidered and that production moves to the production areas with higher competitive advantages. The suggestion to limit the necessary quota cuts to the B quotas would therefore undermine the major motivation for reform as it would harm more strongly the most competitive producers.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises, however, that reform will affect beet farmers and sugar processors and that production may be reduced or even stop in some Member States. To cushion this impact the reform proposal foresees a series of measures: Farmers will be compensated on the basis of their beet production in the past and in addition, may switch to alternative and more competitive crops. By allowing for quota transfer, inefficient sugar producers will be able to sell their quota, and if this is not possible apply for a conversion aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0356"></a>

<p>With a view to the next financial perspective, the European Commission has brought forward a proposal for the introduction of a single rural development fund (EARDF) under which the number of actions eligible for funding is increased, primarily as a result of the introduction of Natura 2000, while the level of funding allocated to rural development - the second pillar of the common agricultural policy - remains the same. This proposal is not only financially unviable but also completely ignores the need to award greater priority to measures targeting young farmers and to provide them with more resources to assist hand-over to the next generation, lack of which is one of the main problems currently affecting rural areas.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not consider that it should reassess its order of priorities, taking into account the paucity of funds available for rural development?</p>

<p>(EN) 1. The proposal for the future EU rural development policy 2007-2013<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>presents an adapted menu of measures which have been divided in three priority Axis: Axis 1: Improving the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sector; Axis 2 land management and enhancing the environment; and Axis 3, diversification of the rural economy and the quality of life. The new proposal will be funded by a budget of 97.2 billion euros (in 2004 prices).</p>
<p>The first priority axis continues to include the measure “Setting up of young farmers” within the subgroup of measures aimed at improving the human potential (together with the measures: vocational training and information actions for persons engaged in the agricultural and forestry sectors, early retirement of farmers and farm workers, use by farmers and forest holders of advisory services and setting up of farm management, farm relief and farm advisory services, as well as of forestry advisory services).</p>
<p>Farmers wanting to benefit from support under the measure “setting up of young farmers” have to fulfil a new condition: to submit a business plan for the development of their farming activities. Moreover, the maximum amount of the single premium has been increased from 25.000 to 40.000 euros.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the measure “support for the modernisation of farms” will continue to have higher support rates where the investment projects are presented by young farmers.</p>
<p>The future EU Rural Development Policy will continue to be based on the principle of subsidiarity; that is to say, Member States and regions will have to set up their rural development programmes on the basis of their priorities and needs. It will be up to them to select the “setting up of young farmers” measure in their programmes and also to use other measures -such as training or early retirement- to facilitate the generational transfer of agricultural activities in the context of an ageing EU agriculture and also to decide on the amounts to allocate to these measures within their rural development programmes.</p>
<p>2. In the current 2000-2006 programming period, almost all Member States from the EU-15 have chosen to include the setting up of young farmers in their rural development programmes and this measure represents around 3,7% on average of the total European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) monies for the period 2000-2006. Regarding the 10 new Member States, five have included this measure in their 2004-2006 rural development programmes and it represents 2% of the total programmed budget during the period 2004-2006.</p>
<p>The budgets allocated to the rural development programmes have to respect the financial perspectives 2000-2006 agreed in Berlin in 1999. A modification to transfer money from other measures to the “setting up of young farmers” measure is possible within the total allocation, if a Member State wishes to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has already received a letter from the inhabitants of Nea Makri, which object to a proposed yachting marina. Based on the available information, the Commission is of the view that there are no grounds for considering that EC environmental legislation has been infringed.</p>
<p>The area of Nea Makri has not been proposed by the Greek authorities as Site of Community Importance on the basis of relevant scientific information and the criteria set out in Annex III of Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In particular, with regard to the protection of the habitat type “Posidonia beds”, it should be stressed that Article 6 of the Directive sets out provisions which govern the conservation and management of Natura 2000 sites and does not protect specific habitat types outside of the sites proposed under the Directive.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of the project on the proposed Site of Community Importance of Schinias-Marathonas (code GR 3000003), it must be noted that the site is not close to Nea Makri and its marine and coastal zones are limited. In addition, the study prepared for the project, which was sent to the Commission by the inhabitants of Nea Makri, takes duly into account the existence of the site and refers to the Presidential Decree for the protection of the site. The project is therefore not likely to have a significant effect on the site or to adversely affect its integrity. Consequently, there is no violation of Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC.</p>
<p>As regards the impact on the cultural heritage, the ministerial decision approving the location of the yachting marina includes specific conditions, such as the supervision of the works by the services responsible for archaeology or suspension of the works where archaeological findings are brought to light.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member refers in his question to the five Member States that have not yet transposed the directives making up the new EU e-communications regulatory framework.</p>
<p>As of 14 October twenty Member States had notified the adoption of legislation to transpose the new regulatory framework (five European Parliament and Council directives). This represents a considerable achievement for each of them.</p>
<p>The Commission launched infringement proceedings in October last year against those of the EU15 Member States which had not notified transposition of the five Directives, and proceedings are already pending before the Court of Justice (Belgium, Greece, and Luxembourg). The Commission is considering infringement action in regard to the two new Member States (Czech Republic, Estonia) concerned.</p>
<p>Secondary legislation is still to be adopted in several Member States in order to give full effect to primary legislation. The Commission is monitoring this process closely, and further action will if necessary be taken against those and other Members States under Article 226 of the Treaty as regards the conformity of national legislation with the framework.</p>
<p>It is clearly a matter of concern that not all Member States have completed the process. However, delay does not mean regulatory relief for players with significant market power, to the extent that the remedies under the old framework continue to apply until determinations are made under the new (Article 27 Framework Directive).</p>
<p>As regards the Competition Directive (Commission Directive enshrining the principles of liberalisation), in the spring of this year the Commission brought Germany, Greece, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands before the Court for not having supplied the Commission with information allowing it to confirm that the provisions of the Directive had been complied with. The Commission has subsequently closed the procedures against Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Belgium has provided information which, for the time being, does not seem sufficient to confirm that its legislation is fully compliant.</p>
<p>As regards the effect of legislation in those Member States in which it has been implemented, it is clear that rapid transposition is of vital importance to the sector. In particular, delay in transposition slows down the process whereby National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) analyse markets and withdraw, amend or impose regulation in the light of the level of competition found to exist.</p>
<p>One important aspect of the new framework, which was strongly supported by the Parliament at the time of adoption of the Directives, gives the Commission powers to oversee the national regulatory measures by way of the consultation and transparency procedures provided for under Article 7 of the </p>
<p>. The Commission has received more than 100 market notifications, and has made detailed comments on a number of these, although only three have so far led to a veto decision. The Parliament has been, and will be, informed of the outcome of the process leading to such decisions.</p>
<p>The new framework has therefore already allowed NRAs to take action to ensure better regulation in the sector in line with the objectives of the framework. The Commission is pressing all Member States to complete their notifications as rapidly as possible to enable this process of tailored and proportionate regulation to be carried forward.</p>
<p>As regards the provision of cheaper services to consumers and the impact the opening of markets had on the consumer’s wallet, it is clear that the full liberalisation of telecommunications markets on 1 January 1998 brought tangible results for consumers.</p>
<p>Between August 1998 and August 2003, for example, calls from fixed telephones allowed residential and business users in Europe to save 13% and 23% respectively on their average monthly telephone bills. The savings were even more dramatic for international calls, where the average cost of 10 minute calls to all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries fell by 41% for residential users and by 45% for business users during the same period.</p>
<p>Liberalisation has also brought consumers greater choice. For example, last year a third of EU subscribers were using an alternative provider (i.e. not the incumbent operator) for long-distance and international calls. There is also a growing choice of broadband internet services at different levels of quality and price to suit the needs, and the wallets, of different consumers.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns relating to the high cost of calls to mobile networks. This problem is being tackled by the inclusion by the Commission of this market in its Recommendation on relevant markets. In principle, all operators have significant market power in their own networks, and NRAs can consequently apply appropriate regulation to remedy competitive distortions. The Commission believes this will bring termination rates down considerably.</p>
<p>There are also concerns as to the level of international roaming charges. The Commission is currently carrying out an investigation using its competition law powers. In addition, other measures under the new regulatory framework can be brought to bear on this issue. The Commission’s Recommendation on relevant markets identifies the wholesale national market for international roaming as a market that may be subject to ex-ante regulation if it is found not to be competitive. Although these are national markets, NRAs are working on a coordinated response, given the international nature of the issue. These actions are complementary and, combined with technologies providing the possibility for calls to be routed over the network offering the lowest-priced roaming when visiting another EU country, will enable the Commission to bring maximum pressure to bear in favour of consumers.</p>
<p>As regards the Lisbon objectives, the Heads of State and of Government rightly pinpointed the full and effective implementation of the regulatory framework as one of the essential elements. However, regulatory reform does not yield results overnight. The reform aims first of all to increase legal certainty by providing market players with a stable but flexible framework as a platform for investment and the introduction of innovative services. In the five years to 2003, new entrant fixed line operators alone invested 70 billion € in the EU 15, and are looking to invest 18.5 billion € in the three years to 2006<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) Disciplinary procedure is necessarily confidential and the Commission is consequently not at liberty to go beyond the information given, in summary, in its press release.</p>
<p>The Commission can, within that necessary limitation, inform the Honourable Member:</p>
<p>That the issue of public statements made by Commission representatives to which he referred in his question was specifically raised before the Disciplinary Board and the Board gave full and careful consideration to that matter in its Opinion;</p>
<p>That the Staff Regulations require the members of the Disciplinary Board to be completely independent in the performance of their duties. This Board is composed of two senior officials chosen by lot from a list established by the administration and two senior officials chosen by lot from a list established by the staff trade unions. To further strengthen the independence of the Board its Chairman is a person of good standing from outside the Institution. The current Chairman is a former President of the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore refutes the suggestion that Ms Andreasen was judged by senior officials “whose work was the subject of Ms Andreasen’s allegations”, and rejects any implication that the Board lacks impartiality. In fact, not one of the officials on the Disciplinary Board was from Ms Andreasen’s service of origin (DG BUDGET) and none have had any direct involvement in the modernisation of the Commission’s accounting system.</p>

<p>- That the Commission considers that Ms Andreasen has had full entitlement to due process and to respect for the presumption of innocence throughout the whole disciplinary procedure. Consistent with that, she continued to receive her full salary throughout the period since procedures were inaugurated in July 2002. Mrs Andreasen was able to fully exercise her rights of defence, including the right to be heard, to submit written comments, to call witnesses, and to be assisted by legal counsel and other persons of her choice at every stage of the procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0362"></a>

The Commission has launched a complaint in the WTO against Korea challenging actionable subsidies (restructuring aids) and prohibited subsidies (export contingent aid). The EC considers these measures have caused injury to the European shipyards. The procedure is currently ongoing in Geneva and the outcome is expected early in 2005.</p>
<p>Temporary defensive mechanism. The Commission already in 2001 proposed a temporary defensive aid to help EU shipyards face the unfair Korean competition in several market segments, such as product-, chemical- and Liquified Natural Gaz-tankers and container ships. This aid, of up to 6% of the contract value per ship, is available since October 2002 and was recently prolonged until 31 March 2005.</p>
<p>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Negotiations to achieve a New shipbuilding. Agreement The aim of the negotiations is to create a real level playing field in the world shipbuilding market and fair competition through two instruments: a strong subsidy discipline and an efficient pricing discipline to address the main distortive effects on the world shipbuilding market. All major shipbuilding nations participate in the negotiations including Korea, China, Japan and the EU. The deadline to conclude such an Agreement is scheduled for the end of 2005.</p>
<p>InterSHIP is a EUR 38 million research project, financed jointly by Euroyards and the Commission and designed to improve the competitiveness of European cruise, ferry and ro-pax shipbuilders, to develop safer and more environmentally friendly ships considering their entire life cycle, and to achieve a drastic reduction of building and development costs as well as time-to-market of innovative solutions.</p>
<p>“LeaderSHIP 2015” is a Commission initiative aiming at strengthening the competitiveness of EC shipyards. The Leadership 2015 Group has identified a number of priorities in the field of maritime industries: strengthening Research &amp; Development and innovation, establishing a level playing field at world level, developing financial and guarantee schemes, ensuring the protection of intellectual property rights, and providing access to a skilled workforce. Implementation of these priorities will be subject to particularly close scrutiny. In both cases, this will mean implementing the guidelines proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Council on the basis of the recommendation of the High-Level groups.</p>
<p>One of the first results of LeaderSHIP is the support for innovation. This was included in the new Framework on State aid to shipbuilding, which is applicable since 1 January 2004 and which allows up to 20% innovation aid for shipbuilding for the innovative parts of the project. Shipbuilding is the only industrial sector in the EU that has access to such aid.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that further consolidation, respecting competition rules, can generate benefits for all types of activity including commercial and naval shipbuilding, and ship repair.</p>
<p>As far as Greek Shipyards are concerned, the Commission has approved in the past large amounts of restructuring aid for all the big shipbuilding companies (Skaramangas, Elefsina and Newrion) in order to facilitate their restructuring.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that the above measures will contribute to the maintenance of a competitive European shipbuilding sector in the world market.</p>
<p>As far as the respect of labour law is concerned, the Commission wishes to underline that this is a matter which falls under the competence of Member States, including, eventually, national Courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The sum of EUR 172 000 mentioned by the Commission in its response to Question No <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0260_EN.html">H-260/04</a> asked by the Honourable Member, concerns all three Commissioners and covers the costs of installation and resettlement (EUR 162 000) and travel expenses (EUR 10 000).</p>
<p>A transitional allowance of some EUR 72 424.65 per month is also awarded to each Commissioner for the three years after they leave. Furthermore, each Commissioner also receives a monthly pension of EUR 387 from the age of 65.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the composition of cabinet members taking up their duties on 1 November 2004 has not yet been definitively established. Accordingly, given that the Commission does not know which of the current staff will be leaving, it is not yet in a position to state the exact sum of the costs incurred through the possible departure of the relevant staff of the Commissioners.</p>
<p>Supposing, for example, that each of the 13 external Members (temporary cabinet agents) currently allocated to the three cabinets in question and divided among the three categories A, B and C had to leave the Commission on 31 October, they would receive neither installation/resettlement costs, nor their transitional allowance. They would, however, be refunded their pension rights contributions (28.5% of their gross salary) up to a total and maximum sum of EUR 86 000 for all 13 people concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is very concerned about the current unstable situation in Haiti. The fact that the United Nations peace keeping force has not been provided with the total authorized strength makes it very difficult for it to fulfil its mandate and gives the opportunity to the rebels to undermine the Interim Government’s steps to promote stability and strengthen democratic institutions. The Commission hopes that the contributing States will deliver the necessary means to the Mission to establish a secure and stable environment which is crucial for donors efforts in developmental assistance to be successful and sustainable.</p>
<p>However, the recent resumption of violence is not jeopardizing the start of the implementation of Commission supported development aid projects. To respond to the urgent needs, projects are being prepared. A rehabilitation project for € 27.5 million to improve access of the population to basic socio-economic infrastructures and services was launched immediately after the multi donors pledging conference in July 2004.The Commission is keenly aware of the difficult social and economic situation in Haiti. Therefore, the political message reiterating the importance of respect for human rights and the rule of law and the holding of elections in 2005 is delivered in parallel to a substantial funding pledge of over € 270 million.</p>
<p>To reduce the impact of natural disasters in Haiti, there is a need to tackle this problem in a structural way. One of the causes of the latest disaster in Haiti is deforestation. The Commission is funding a territorial geographical information programme for sustainable development in Haiti for € 7 million.</p>
<p>Even during the period that cooperation with the Government of Haiti was restricted, assistance always continued though alternative means in order not to add to the suffering of the Haiti population. Since 1991, close to half a billion Euros of grants have been committed in Haiti by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
