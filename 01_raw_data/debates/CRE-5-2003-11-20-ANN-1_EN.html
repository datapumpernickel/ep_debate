<p>The Basque-language newspaper ‘Euskaldunon Egunkaria’ remains closed. So far, links between it and the ETA terrorist gang have not been proven. Recently, there has been a further accusation of tax fraud. In this connection the Diputación de Gipuzkoa - the tax authority responsible on the Basque territory of Gipuzkoa, where the newspaper has its headquarters, has drawn up a report which notes no kind of tax fraud whatever. Nonetheless, the Spanish judicial authorities continue their efforts to criminalise the activities of ‘Euskaldunon Egunkaria’. Three members of the editorial team and staff of the newspaper are currently still in prison. Two weeks ago, nine ‘Euskaldunon Egunkaria’ employees were jailed, and then liberated, five of them, apparently with no charges being brought, or any bail paid, including the plaintiffs’ own lawyer.</p>

<p>One week after the local elections in Albania, the Central Elections Commission has decided to repeat, on 16 November 2003, the elections in four constituencies (the municipalities of Piluri, Dhermi, Qeparo and southern Himara), citing irregularities during the election process of 12 October 2003, in spite of the fact that in two of the four cases the irregularities cited occurred after the finalisation and certification of the results.</p>
<p>As a result, there are legitimate concerns that these actions are intended to overturn the results of the local elections, which were 65% in favour of the Unity for Human Rights Party candidate as against the opposing candidate from the socialist party.</p>
<p>These concerns are heightened by the criminal prosecution of five Albanians of Greek origin who participated in the elections and are accused of issuing anti-Albanian propaganda and putting up foreign symbols. What steps does the Council intend to take, particularly within the framework of the Stability and Association Process between South East Europe and the European Union, to ensure that democratic process is complied with in the elections due to be held again in Himara on 16 November 2003?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) In the Conclusions of the Council Meeting on External Relations on 29 September 2003 in Brussels, the Council "emphasised" that the orderly conduct of fair local elections in October is part of the process to bring Albania closer to the EU".

<p>The local elections in Albania on 12 October 2003, including the implementation of the new Electoral Code and the performance of the Electoral Committee, have been monitored by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission to which many EU member states contributed monitors. The Preliminary Conclusions indicated that the elections were held in an improved political environment and they marked a further progress towards compliance with international commitments and standards for democratic elections, albeit shortcomings (e.g. voter lists) were also observed. The Council expects a final assessment by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation mission, including developments related to the issue of elections' repetition in some voting centres.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0671"></a>

This includes Directives on Distance selling, Electronic commerce, Consumer contracts and Data protection as well as Decisions on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment and serious forms of international crime. In addition, the Council and the European Parliament are currently examining, using the co-decision procedure, the Commission proposal for establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency, which should also contribute to enhanced “cybersecurity”.</p>
<p>Regarding technological development in this field, the honourable Member should consider the Research Framework Programmes of the European Community support activities, including those carried out by the Joint Research Centre, which aim, amongst other objectives, at securing the rights and privacy of citizens, also in the field of “cybersecurity”, some results of which were referred to by the honourable Member. The Programme is implemented by the Commission, and it is normally for the participants of the individual research projects to exploit the results achieved. The Council does not have proposals from the Commission regarding possible follow up to the particular research work in question. Should the Commission submit such proposals, the aspects referred to by the honourable Member would certainly be taken into consideration in their examination. The honourable Member is therefore advised to turn to the Commission for any further information on this matter.</p>
<p>On the specific question of the localisation of the future research network and proposed Foundation no decision has yet been taken by the competent authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0689"></a>

<p>The October 2003 Brussels European Council, according to paragraph 38 of its conclusions, approved the prolongation of the specific additional milk quota for the Azores, corresponding to the region's internal consumption of milk and dairy products as approved by the Nice European Council in 2000. This decision annulled those of the Agriculture Council which would have reduced the quota by 23 000 tonnes.</p>
<p>There is, however, no mention in the same paragraph of those conclusions of a single extra litre of milk quota being allocated to the Azores (the region's share of the general and specific milk quotas remains unchanged in all respects). Still less is there any mention of any waiver - not so much as a euro's worth - of any fines. Nonetheless, the Portuguese government and press continue to repeat the opposite, claiming that there has been an increase in the permitted production level, as well as a fine waiver.</p>
<p>The milk producers in the Azores have thus been astonished to discover that there will in fact be no waiver of fines already paid, and that they are not authorised to produce so much as one litre more than in the past.</p>
<p>Will the Council approve a fine waiver for milk producers in the Azores, thus returning them the amounts they had to pay over the last production year?</p>

<p>(IT) Within the framework of the political agreement reached on reform of the CAP, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, at a meeting last June in Luxembourg, decided to extend the system of milk quotas up until the marketing year 2004/2005. In this context, the quota allocated to the Azores was increased by 50 000 tonnes as from the marketing year 2005/2006, an increase which means that production will be able to reach a total of 500 000 tonnes.</p>
<p>To facilitate the gradual shift to this quota for this outermost region, the Commission tabled a proposal to the Council on 16 October 2003 extending exemption from the system of fines in the milk sector. This would make it easier for the milk sector to adapt to the agreed supplementary quota by a fixed deadline.</p>

<p>(IT) One of the priorities of the European Union for the EU-Russia summit in Rome on 6 November 2003 was to increase co-operation with Russia in the field of environment. </p>
<p>The Joint Statement of the 12th EU-Russia Summit in Rome on 6 November 2003 says under point 10: "We recognised our responsibility to tackle together and in the framework of relevant international organisations, instruments and fora, common environmental challenges and shared concerns regarding climate change and transport safety."</p>
<p>While there was no specific reference to the LukOil project or the EBRD's support, nor to any specific environmental impact assessment of this project at the Summit, the EU raised its concerns about the need to strengthen co-operation in maritime safety. The Commission has made known its intention to use upcoming meetings, also at technical level, to invite the Russian authorities to reinforce cooperation with other countries bordering the Baltic Sea, notably Lithuania, as far as environmental issues and environmental management of the Baltic Sea are concerned. The Commission announced in particular that it will call on Russia to agree on an accelerated timetable to phase out the use of single hull tankers and the immediate cessation of the use of such vessels for transporting heavy grades of oil.</p>
<p>The Russian Federation acknowledged these concerns, as one of the environmental challenges that the EU and Russia should tackle together.</p>

The Council is very much attached to environmentally satisfactory conditions of any such project but it is not in a position to comment on the approval of the EBRD support to the specific LukOil project and the procedures to be followed in that context, as these are matters which fall within the competence of the Board of Directors of the EBRD.

<p>(IT) The Council recalls the honourable Parliamentarian the framework within which the fight against terrorism is conducted within the Union with particular regard for the respect of the fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The issue of the fight against international terrorism in relation to major sporting events is being discussed between the Member States. A seminar on this theme has been held on 10/11 April 2003 in Athens.</p>
<p>The Council has been informed that the Task Force of Chiefs of Police, on the occasion of its 7<span class="sup">th</span> meeting in Crete on 19/20 May 2003, had already decided to draw up a Specific Security Handbook to be used to develop a direct police cooperation during the Olympic Games, focussing on the specific nature of the threat. At the meeting of the Task Force of the Chiefs of Police on 6/7 October 2003 in Rome the drawing up of this Security Handbook was discussed.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has also been agreed within the framework of the Task Force that Member States should set up an ad hoc multinational team with the participation of Europol, tasked with the early identification of the most concrete threats, and of the sources of terrorist organisations.</p>
<p>In order to prepare the work of this multinational team, experts from the Member States including Acceding States, representatives of Europol as well as experts from third countries will meet in Athens during the autumn, under the responsibility of the Greek Police.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0710"></a>

HIV counselling has been defined as "a confidential dialogue between a person and a care provider aimed at enabling the person to cope with stress and make personal decisions related to HIV/AIDS. The counselling process includes an evaluation of personal risk of HIV transmission and facilitation of preventive behaviour. "The objectives of HIV counselling are the prevention of HIV transmission and the emotional support of those who wish to consider HIV testing, both to help them make a decision about whether or not to be tested, and to provide support and facilitate decision-making following testing.</p>

<p>As a so-called co-chair together with Norway, the US and Japan, the Presidency and the Commission has issued a joint statement expressing our concern that the recent developments in Sri Lanka may put at risk the spirit of cohabitation between the President and the Government of Sri Lanka, which has proven vital for the sustained forward momentum of the peace process. The Presidency and the Commission further urged the two principal parties to continue to work together in support of a negotiated political solution.</p>
<p>In addition the Member of the Commission in charge of External Relations has been in contact with the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe by telephone encouraging him to find a way back to co-habit with the President. The Commission will continue to send positive signals in the hope that tension can be reduced. The Commission is closely coordinating any action with Norway as facilitator of the Peace Process and the other co-chairs. The Commission further remains in daily contact with its Delegation in Colombo for updates of the situation.</p>
<p>25-26 November 2003, the Member of the Commission in charge of External Relations will visit Sri Lanka as previously planned.

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the increasing concerns about Russia’s plan to start prospecting for oil in the sensitive Baltic Sea environment of the Curonian Spit without having conducted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) meeting high international standards.</p>
<p>While environmental matters were raised at the recent EU-Russia Summit in Rome, no concrete agreement was reached concerning oil drilling in the Baltic.</p>
<p>The Commission has for some time urged Russia to adopt an accelerated timetable to phase out the use of single hull tankers and the immediate cessation of the use of such tankers for transporting heavy grades of oil, in line with the similar provisions taken at Union level (Regulation 1726/2003 of 22 July 2003, which entered into force the 21<span class="sup">st</span> of October 2003). As part of the acquis, this regulation will apply to ports, offshore terminals and sea areas under the jurisdiction of Lithuania as of the date of its accession to the Union (1<span class="sup">st</span> May 2004). Following the request of the EU Council of Transport Ministers a formal proposal along those lines was tabled by the 15 Member States to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and will be discussed again at its upcoming Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) December meeting.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the question of oil extraction by Russia in the Baltic Sea raises issues that have to be discussed directly with the Russian Federation. Therefore, the Commission will combine its efforts with current and future Member States to convince the Russian side that for the sake of the safety of all Baltic Sea States, including Russia, a transparent EIA meeting high international standards shall be conducted and all relevant precautionary emergency measures have to be foreseen.</p>
<p>There was an European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) loan of EUR 150 million to Lukoil dating back to 2000 for medium term working capital. As far as the Commission knows there is no connection between this and the Curonian spit project (which requires a different type of long-term financing). Moreover, the EBRD management informed the Commission that there are currently no other LUKoil projects in the Bank's “pipeline”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0717"></a>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member points out, the G8 is neither an institution nor an international organisation and has no legal basis. The G8 takes no binding decisions and there are no formal rules of procedure or a permanent secretariat. Each G8 member country holds the rotating Presidency for one calendar year. The country holding the Chair hosts the Summit and proposes the agenda as well as organising a cycle of preparatory meetings which was the case for France and the Evian Summit in 2003.</p>
<p>But the Summit is more than a symbolic meeting and the G8 can play a real and important role. The 1996 Summit in Lyon launched the first Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative while at Evian in 2003, the Leaders addressed the challenges of promoting growth, enhancing sustainable development and improving security.</p>
<p>With reference to the honourable Member’s specific question on a possible G8 role in terrorism, he should be aware that the G8 already plays an active role. Through its Roma and Lyon Groups (respectively responsible for issues related to terrorism and organised crime) and related expert sub-groups it has made a significant contribution to the development of international thinking on terrorism and organised crime. For example, the G8 has been active both in the development of the 12 UN sectoral Conventions against terrorism and in calling for worldwide ratification and implementation of these instruments. A key recent development has been the creation at the Evian Summit of the Counter-Terrorism Action Group (CTAG). This brings G8 members together with, inter alia, the UN Counter Terrorism Committee with the aim of better co-ordinating international counter-terrorism assistance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0633"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member in relation to the important issue of low birth rates. This issue is recognised by demographers as very complex. Looking at the policy debate over the last 20 years it is also true that there is no single solution to this question.</p>
<p>At European level it is important to highlight that a wide range of policies which affect fertility – including family and child policies – are of national competence, and the European Union does not have a legal basis to develop and implement initiatives in these areas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, European employment and social policies may have an impact on families, and therefore the Commission places particular emphasis on family-friendly policies, in such areas as employment and childcare. More specifically, the European Employment Strategy – in line with the Conclusions of the European Council of Barcelona (2002) – addresses the problem of reconciling work and family life. The guidelines of the 2003 European Employment Strategy commit Member States to "remove disincentives to female labour force participation and strive, taking into account the demand for childcare facilities and in line with national patterns of childcare provision, to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under three years of age."</p>

<p>(EN) The failure of the Cancun Ministerial was a setback not only for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) but for the EU-Mercosur biregional negotiations as well. This is mainly due to the fact that both negotiating processes run on two parallel and similar tracks. Whatever the Commission achieves on the World Trade Organization (WTO) side should be improved on the biregional side (‘WTO-plus’), otherwise extra concessions from our side would not be reciprocated and the EU would find itself in the difficult situation to pay twice. This similarity is directly linked to the level and type of market access interests at stake in both negotiations.</p>

It was used already for the negotiations with Chile, although in a different context than the agricultural one. Actually in the case of Chile the Commission achieved important steps in the “new WTO issues” with the introduction inter alia of transparency rules on government procurements, an ambitious agenda for trade facilitation an important steps on wine’s geographical indications and an enhanced bilateral dispute settlement For the EU-Mexico agreement, the idea of going beyond WTO rules - that in any cases constituted the FTA basis and framework - was not the real benchmark. At that time the benchmark for EU negotiators was the so called “NAFTA parity” : achieving the same trade benefits granted from Mexico to its northern neighbours for European goods and European companies.</p>
<p>For both negotiating processes (DDA and EU-Mercosur), the main immediate impact of failure of the Cancun Ministerial was to delay the effective resumption of negotiations and put in serious doubt their completion, according to the agreed timeframes. In the same line, the definition of a concrete preferential market access for Mercosur countries became even more difficult to assess after Cancun, when no benchmarks for commitments undertaken by the Union in the framework of the DDA were available.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, negotiations with Mercosur have now been re-launched during the Trade Negotiators Meeting at Ministerial Level, which took place in Brussels on 12 November. Ministers agreed to an ambitious work programme with a view to beginning the concluding period of negotiations. To this end, five meetings of the Bi-regional Negotiating Committee and two meetings at ministerial level, until October 2004, have been scheduled. In addition, both sides recognised the importance of progress in the Doha Development Agenda in parallel with EU-Mercosur negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0638"></a>

<p>However, given that Irish farmers and meat processors are subject to very strict traceability and labelling requirements under the 'Farm to Fork' food safety regime; the fact that the catering industry, including hotels and restaurants, accounts for a large percentage (up to 30% according to Bord Bia) of beef consumption in Ireland; and the fact that hotels and restaurants are not included in the EU regulations on beef labelling for operators involved in the marketing of beef within the EU; could the Commission explain this perverse exemption from existing rules and whether it has proposals to extend the EU beef traceability and labelling rules to the catering sector in the interest of consumer safety and the food chain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) In 2000 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EC) 1760/2000, the main purpose of which is to ensure the full traceability of beef from birth to the end consumer and to inform consumers of its origin, which is defined as the country (or countries) of birth, raising and slaughter of the animals from which the meat comes.</p>
<p>Consequently, all the fresh beef which is placed on the Community market must be labelled in accordance with the provisions of that Regulation, irrespective of whether it is intended for retail sale or for supplying the catering sector. That requirement also applies to beef imported from third countries.</p>

<p>(EN) All animal experiments in the Union, including those using non-human primates, must comply with the provisions of Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. The Directive had to be transposed into national legislation in November 1989.</p>
<p>The Directive seeks to improve the controls on the use of laboratory animals, to set minimum standards for housing and care, and addresses in broad terms the training of personnel handling animals and supervising experiments. It also aims at replacing animal testing methods with non-animal methods wherever possible, as well as encouraging the development and validation of alternative methods. Where animals have to be used, the Directive aims to ensure that it is only the minimum number, and that any animal suffering is the minimum necessary to achieve the scientific objective i.e. avoidable suffering should not be caused.</p>
<p>Since the scientific basis of the Directive dates back more than 15 years, some provisions should be revisited in the light of more recent scientific data. To improve the situation, the Commission has started the revision of the Directive. In 2002, the Commission asked the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare (SCAHAW) to prepare a report specifically on the welfare of non-human primates used for experiments. The report was adopted in December 2002 and can be found at the Europa web site<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The report will feed into the upcoming revision of the Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is also working to improve animal welfare in research in other ways. According to the Action Plan for Science and Society, published in December 2001, the Commission will:</p>
<p>- foster networks of animal welfare committees in order to exchange information and develop best practice for ethical review of animal experiments</p>
<p>- encourage training of scientists on animal welfare issues and improve the awareness of researchers on the principles of the 3 R’s (replacement, reduction and refinement).</p>
<p>By contributing to the revision of the animal welfare legislation and promoting the use of alternative methods in testing and research, the JRC service ECVAM (European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods) in a more general sense supports improvements of standards and the reduction of animal use.</p>
<p>In research supported by the Commission under the framework programmes for RTD, applicants have to describe the procedures adopted to respect the principles of the 3Rs and to protect the welfare of animals. Detailed guidance to the applicant is provided under point 7 of the “Crucial information for the Sixth Framework Programme applicants who have identified ethical issues in the Guide for Proposers checklist”<a href="#defann_33_3" name="refann_33_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Council decision on the 6th Framework programme (Decision No. 834/2002/EC) specifies that under this programme the use of non-human primates must be replaced with alternatives wherever possible.</p>
<p>An ethical review is implemented systematically for proposals dealing with sensitive issues such as the use of non-human primates. The ethical review ensures among others that all research involving animals are conducted in accordance with Directive 86/609/CEE and that the principles of the 3Rs are fully applied in the proposed projects. Furthermore, participants in research projects must seek the approval of the relevant national authorities prior to the start of the research activities.</p>
<p>In order to promote the reduction and the replacement of animals in research the Commission supports research specifically aiming at developing in vitro alternatives to animal testing. Under the Fifth Framework Programme, some 43 such projects were funded, for a total Community contribution of about EUR 65 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the Swedish Government proposal 'Framtidens Tullverk' (customs service of the future), 430 customs staff are to lose their jobs in Sweden. Customs operations are being completely discontinued at, inter alia, Idre (Dalarna) close to the border with Norway and at the ports of Västeräs and Köping at Lake Mälaren west of Stockholm. Those two ports handle considerable traffic from and to the Schengen Area. For some time now, there have been effectively no customs operations at the Nynäshamm ferry terminal south of Stockholm. As a result of so sweeping a scaling down of Swedish policing of the EU's external borders, there is a greater risk of more drugs and arms trafficking plus illegal immigration into the EU as a whole.</p>

<p>(EN) The question of the honourable Member addresses a number of issues regarding free circulation of goods and persons.</p>
<p>As regards customs, it is true that Norway is to be considered as a third country. As a consequence the Swedish-Norwegian border is an external border of the EU Customs Union. Each Member State is free, however, to determine the place where it requires customs formalities to be handled as far as adequate level of protection of the Community's interests is guaranteed.</p>
<p>As regards customs controls to detect and prevent cross-border traffic in prohibited or restricted goods at the external border of the Union, the Commission considers that there should be an equivalent level of protection at all entry and exit points of the EU. However, how Member States deploy their resources for these controls is a matter of national competence.</p>
<p>With regard to persons, the land border between Sweden and Norway is to be considered as an internal border in the sense of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement. This is a consequence of the Accession agreement of 19 December 1996 by means of which Sweden became member of the Schengen co-operation and the Association Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 with Norway and Iceland on the one hand and the Council of the European Union on the other.</p>
<p>The decision to finally abolish the border controls on persons as from 25 March 2001 between the Nordic Countries, including Sweden, and between them and the rest of the Schengen family was taken after a number of evaluations had been conducted on their preparedness to apply the Schengen Acquis.</p>
<p>Regarding the flows of persons via the ports that the honourable Member mentions in his question (Västeräs and Köping at Lake Mälaren west of Stockholm, and the Nynäshamm ferry terminal south of Stockholm), the situation is as follows. When a person travels between Sweden and another Schengen State on a regular ferry connecting exclusively from or to ports within the territories of the Schengen States and not calling on any ports outside those territories, no control will take place since this connection is considered as the crossing of an internal border. All other transport is considered as the crossing of an external border and the appropriate controls should take place. The respect of these principles has been checked by the evaluation that has been conducted by the Standing Committee on Schengen Evaluation prior to the lifting of the internal border controls.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0653"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has examined carefully in its Extended Impact Assessment the effects of the three options which were at hand when the Commission was asked by the Council to reform the tobacco sector along the same lines as the first CAP reform.</p>
<p>The option of decoupling is - in particular for Greece - the best solution, because the majority of tobacco farms in Greece are small, and farmers who had quotas below 3,5 tonnes in the reference period will in future receive the same amount of aid as they received in the reference period.</p>
<p>For farmers with bigger quotas there will be a reduction in the support level, but this reduction will be transferred to a restructuring fund and the funds will remain in the Member State where they are collected.</p>
<p>With decoupled aid the farmers will be free to produce whatever product they want, and there will surely be some who will choose to shift to other products, but we expect that many farmers will continue producing tobacco, because it is the product in which they have expertise. The number of farmers who decide to continue with tobacco production will also depend on the price level the first processing industry will offer.</p>
<p>The restructuring fund will finance support to tobacco producers who want to shift to other productions or to other economic activities and also to finance improvements of the infrastructure in the tobacco growing regions.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the gradual decoupling together with the setting up of a special restructuring fund will provide the tobacco sector with the most sustainable policy for the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0654"></a>

<p>During an official visit to the Valencia region in Spain, the Transport Commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, announced that the building of the Madrid-Valencia high-speed rail link would be speeded up and the completion date brought forward to 2007, pushing it up the list of priorities drawn up by the Commissioner herself, which guaranteed the interoperability of the European network by the end of 2010. A few days later, the Spanish Ministry of Public Works corrected the Commissioner's statement, affirming that no measures had been taken to make an early completion of the rail link to Valencia possible. The Spanish Government then judged the original timetable (2010) to be valid and restored the high-speed rail link to its previous position of nineteenth on the Commission's list of priorities, alongside work on the Mediterranean corridor rail track.</p>
<p>Does the Commission continue to stand by Ms de Palacio's statements about bringing forward to 2007 the completion date for the Madrid-Valencia rail link? If so, can the Commission specify how, with what means and on the basis of what budget forecast it intends to go ahead with this project?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) On 1 October 2003, the Commission put forward its amended proposal revising the Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The proposal includes new priority projects that are added to the fourteen projects on the Essen list already decided in 1994 and to the projects proposed by the Commission in 2001 and supported by the European Parliament. The list of projects judged by the Commission to be priorities contains a total of twenty-six projects still to be carried out between now and 2020.</p>
<p>The Madrid – Valencia AVE line and the Mediterranean corridor are part of project no. 19, ‘Interoperability of the high-speed rail network of the Iberian Peninsula’. The order of the projects in this list does not represent an order of priority: all the projects in the list are of equal priority for the Commission and should be carried out as they become due. With this in mind, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that in the next few weeks the Cohesion Fund is to grant joint funding for several works in the Játiva - Valencia section of the high-speed train corridor between Madrid and Valencia via Albacete. The first Community contributions to this major project in 1997 were 50% of the total costs, solely for the surveys required before moving forward with the work. The surveys for the Madrid – Castilla La Mancha – Community of Valencia – Murcia region high speed line will still receive 36% funding until 2006 for a total cost estimated at EUR 104.2 million, before the respective work starts and in order to complete the project successfully.</p>
<p>The prospects for completing work on all the new priority projects vary depending on how far each one has progressed. In this very general context, it is up to the national authorities to take the appropriate decisions in order to complete the projects. In this context, the Commission notes that some Member States, including Spain, have set ambitious schedules. With regard to the project mentioned by the honourable Member, the Commission has been informed that it will be completed in 2010. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission included instruments in its proposal of 1 October aimed at facilitating their implementation, such as a Declaration of European Interest for priority projects, increased coordination with the help of a European coordinator for projects or groups of projects and the increase in the maximum contribution from the trans-European networks budget to 30% for cross-border projects. Moreover, all the trans-European networks projects in Spain are, in principle, eligible for Community support through the Cohesion Fund and, if necessary, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) A safe and cost-effective operation of a railway network enabling quality services to transport customers requires an efficient management of all the relevant operational and commercial information. The telecommunication system plays a centre role in this context. No matter the technology eventually selected any telecommunication system requires the placing of base stations and the associated antennas along the railway lines to enable operation. The density of these base stations as well as the dimension of their antennas is dependent on both the topography of the terrain and the requirements placed on the quality of service of such communication bearer. In addition, a trade-off between the number of base stations and the height of the antennas is also a consideration that underpins the design of each operational facility.</p>
<p>Finally, the rationale embodied in the Directive 96/48/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed railway system evolves from a perspective of the integration of the national rail systems to enable railways to better meet the challenges of sustaining a competitive profile in the ever more internationalised transportation markets. This strategic overriding goal requires the selection of a reference telecommunication technology capable of ensuring the continuity of communication services across-borders. The adoption of the GSM standard was chosen by the railway sector itself as the best solution for fulfilling the requirements whilst enabling to reap the economic benefits of a telecommunication technology that is in continuous expansion throughout the world.</p>
<p>This solution was further discussed and confirmed in the Committee set up under article 21 of Directive 96/48 and finally adopted through Commission Decision 2002/731/EC of 30 May 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission does not share the honourable Member’s opinion that the draft agricultural agreement between the European Union and Morocco would have a highly negative effect on Spanish tomato producers, and does not therefore consider it necessary to provide for compensation in advance, as he suggests.</p>
<p>It is true that Morocco is a significant player in the winter tomato market. However, between October and March it only represents 13% of the market. Spain represents 47% and the Benelux countries 30%.</p>
<p>However, it is also true that Spain produced 2.67 million tonnes of tomatoes in 1991 and 3.88 million tonnes in 2002, which is an increase of 45%; and it exported 446 000 tonnes of tomatoes to the Community market in 1993 and 817 000 tonnes in 2002, an increase of 83%.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of recent years has been the considerable development in Spanish production and shipments. This was not hampered by the previous agreement, which was described as “catastrophic” by Spanish producers.</p>

<p>(EN) Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union specifies that European Monetary Union (EMU), ultimately including a single currency, is one of the objectives of the Union. In this respect, Sweden joined the European Community without an "opt-out" like Denmark or the United Kingdom. Sweden presently has the status of a "Member State with a derogation".</p>
<p>The adoption of the euro notably requires from Member States with a derogation the fulfilment of the convergence criteria set out in the EC Treaty and in the specific Protocol on those criteria. The Commission (and the European Central Bank (ECB)) monitors compliance with those criteria through publication, every two years, of a convergence report. On a proposal from the Commission, the Council decides whether a Member State with a derogation fulfils the necessary conditions on the basis of the criteria. When the necessary conditions are met, the Council abrogates the derogation of the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>In its last convergence report on Sweden, issued in 2002, the Commission concluded that some of the convergence criteria had not been met and, therefore, did not make a proposal for the Council to change the status of Sweden as a “Member State with a derogation”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0662"></a>

The proposal includes new priority projects that are added to the fourteen projects on the Essen list already decided in 1994 and to the projects proposed by the Commission in 2001 and supported by the European Parliament. The projects were selected after establishing strict criteria also included in the text of the proposal. The list of projects judged by the Commission to be priorities contains a total of twenty-six projects still to be carried out between now and 2020.</p>
<p>The Lisbon/Oporto – Madrid high-speed link is proposed as an extension of priority project no. 3 ‘High-speed railway lines, South West Europe’. Moreover, the whole of the high-speed rail network for the Iberian peninsula (project no. 19) is included as a priority project. The Commission therefore considers it to be a priority link in its proposal.</p>
<p>The projects considered to be priorities also include the Sines-Madrid-Paris freight railway axis (project no. 16), which includes the Sines–Badajoz railway line. All of these rail projects also help to link Portugal with the rest of the trans-European network.</p>
<p>Portugal will also have the opportunity to benefit from the potential of the Motorways of the Sea, particularly their Atlantic dimension, and these are also included in the Commission’s proposal of 1 October as a priority project (project no. 21)</p>
<p>Also, as part of the European Growth Initiative launched by the President of the Commission, on 16 and 17 October the European Council invited the Commission, the EIB and the groups concerned in the Council to establish, without affecting the priorities set in the Commission proposal, a “quick-start programme" containing a list of projects in an enlarged Union. This “quick-start programme”, adopted by the Commission on 11 November<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, does not involve questioning the priorities already defined by the Commission, but on the contrary it is an initiative to speed up the launching of some sections that are ready and cross-border sections in order to create a lever effect on all of the projects, which are all a priority. Among the projects included in this programme are the Lisbon–Madrid and Vigo-Oporto TGV links, and the Motorways of the Sea; all of these projects directly affect Portugal. The Commission will put forward its proposals on the quick-start programme in a report to the European Council in December on the European Growth Initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Tragically the inflow of illegal immigrants by sea, who use unseaworthy vessels operated by criminal networks, continues and has led – once again – to a severe human tragedy.</p>
<p>As stated in the Commission’s reply to the written questions E – 3112/02 by Mr Tannock, P – 0291/03 by Mr. Pisicchio, E – 2133/03 by Mario Borghezio and E- 2347/03 by Camilo Nogueira Román, illegal immigration by sea is given serious and continuous attention within the Commission and the development of a Community policy framework progresses constantly.</p>
<p>Apart from the three action plans – one on illegal immigration specifically, one on integrated border management and one on return policy<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> – which define EU action and contain a schedule for common measures in the fight against illegal immigration, the European Councils in Thessaloniki on 19-20 June and in Brussels on 16-17 October 2003 gave further political steer in this area.</p>
<p>The feasibility study on improving controls at the Union’s external maritime borders carried out by CIVIPOL, as instructed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 28 February 2002, was presented to the Member States in July 2003. This study provided an in-depth analysis of the legislative and/or operational measures that must be adopted and/or revised in order to improve control and surveillance at the Union’s external maritime borders, with the aim, in particular, of combating illegal immigration by sea.</p>
<p>The Commission held a meeting with experts from the Member States in this field, in order to assess the various recommendations set out in the study and, amongst other things, to produce some priorities from the actions proposed by the study. This meeting also contributed to drawing up the working programme being prepared by the Presidency in this field (following the Council request to this effect) and which is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>The Commission also welcomes the creation of two maritime border centres, which has just been approved by the competent Council office.</p>
<p>In this context it is worth mentioning that the Commission has just proposed the establishment of a European Agency for the management of the operational co-operation at the external borders<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This Agency will also assist Member States in implementing Community legislation in the fields of control and surveillance of maritime borders. It is planned to transform the aforementioned maritime border centres as well as the other more informal centres for land borders and airports into a Community structure as specialised branches or local offices of the Agency.</p>
<p>The Agency will not exercise implementing powers. The enforcement of border controls and surveillance would, therefore, fully remain as a sovereign task with the Member States’ authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to thank the honourable Member for tabling a question on labelling of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>Alcoholic beverages, as all foodstuffs, are covered by the Food Labelling Directive 2000/13/EC and this includes the indication of the ingredients. However, the rules for labelling ingredients, laid down at Article 6 of the Directive, are not applicable in the case of alcoholic beverages, since specific rules should have been adopted for these products, pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 3. However these have not yet been adopted.</p>
<p>Such specific rules have been proposed three times by the Commission. No agreement could be found on the first and second proposals, and the last one, adopted in 1997 and amended in 1999 after the first reading of the European Parliament, has not been discussed by Council except, as is rightly mentioned by the honourable Members, in a working group in December 2002, under the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p>At this meeting a majority of delegations was favourable to the labelling of ingredients present in alcoholic beverages, but there were divergent views as to how this should be achieved. There has been no further progress in Council since that meeting, and the Commission is currently considering various options for taking this matter further as it remains of the opinion that the continued absence of ingredients labelling for alcoholic beverages has no justification.</p>
<p>As Parliament knows, the Commission is to engaged in a comprehensive review of the entire food labelling legislation with a view to modernizing and, perhaps, simplifying it. If the proposal on alcoholic beverages has not progressed in Council by the time the Commission is concluding this review, the Commission will obviously include the labelling of ingredients of alcoholic beverages in the proposals that it is bound to make in the light of the general review.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 29 October 2003, the Commission has adopted a communication on “The future of the textiles and clothing sector in the enlarged European Union” (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2003&amp;nu_doc=0649">COM (2003) 649</a> final).In this communication, the Commission invites all interested parties to provide comments on the issues raised.</p>
<p>These issues cover a broad set of policies and instruments with impact on the European textiles and clothing sector, in order to provide a favourable framework to industry. In particular, the Communication focuses on how the industry can adjust better to the current competitive challenges and, in particular, to the elimination of quantitative restrictions to imports from the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of January 2005, to enlargement and to the resulting restructuring and modernisation processes. Notably, the Communication highlights research, innovation, information and communication technologies, training, employment, environment, chemicals, consumer affairs, corporate social responsibility, intellectual property rights, competition, regional and trade policies, that should strengthen the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>All interested parties, including of course from Ireland, are invited to send comments to the Commission preferably by e-mail to , following the procedure set out on the following web-page: </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission intends to set up a high-level sectoral group to stimulate debate and to make recommendations on possible initiatives to facilitate the textiles and clothing sector’s adjustment to the major challenges faced by this sector. Representatives of the European industrial associations will be invited to participate in this group.</p>
<p>The European institutions and the Member States will be kept informed on the work of this group and on the implementation of the Commission’s communication conclusions.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that, this way, it has opened a wide forum of information and consultation enabling all interested parties in the enlarged European Union to present their views.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also raises the question of the attention the Commission will pay to the funding needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The small and medium-sized enterprises dimension is one of the major driving forces behind the industrial policy, and the increased participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Union programmes and instruments is a major political objective.</p>
<p>On the funding aspects, the Commission would like to stress that the financial instruments of the Multiannual programme for enterprises and entrepreneurship (2001-2005) provide European leverage and support for small and medium-sized enterprises financing. These instruments are implemented by the European Investment Fund (EIF), which is the risk finance arm of the European Investment Bank (EIB). Furthermore, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is allocating a significant part of its budget to small and medium-sized enterprises development (up to 1.5 million SME supported during the period 1994-1999).</p>
<p>The small and medium-sized enterprises Guarantee Facility provides guarantees for guarantee schemes and financial institutions within the public and private sector that support lending to SMEs. The facility includes micro-credit guarantees, equity guarantees, and guarantees for loans financing IT equipment, software and training. The SME Guarantee Facility has benefited more than 125 000 SMEs in a wide range of sectors since 1998.</p>
<p>The latest yearly report on the financial instruments indicated that for EU budgetary resources of EUR 155.7 million, the financial intermediaries have been able to guarantee loans to SMEs worth of EUR 9.02 billion. That is, the guarantee facility made possible lending to SMEs that is 58 times the budgetary spending.</p>
<p>With regard to stakeholders, firms need to explore all financing schemes available in the Member States and at Union level. The changes in finance also require more flexibility from SMEs. SMEs need to become more open and transparent when providing information to banks and financial institutions. In some forms of financing, capital suppliers may want to participate in the company’s decision making process. These major changes in entrepreneurial behaviour need to be integrated into the companies’ strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0685"></a>

<p>The EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications prohibits the sending of e-mails without prior consent, except in limited circumstances. The Commission will be pressing Member States to ensure effective implementation of this Directive.</p>
<p>But legislation is only part of the answer. In a forthcoming Communication, the Commission will identify a series of actions for Member States, industry, and consumers, to complement legislation and make the opt-in as effective as possible. They include: effective enforcement by Member States, international cooperation, self-regulatory efforts by industry, technical solutions - e.g. filtering and security - and consumer awareness.</p>
<p>International cooperation is crucial, and the Commission is working actively with other countries both bilaterally and multilaterally to address the problem.

However, he specified that, since August 2002, Trasagua has published on a voluntary basis its notices in the Official Journal of the EU. He also stated that the contracts which had not been published in the Official Journal only represent 5% of all contracts awarded by Trasagua and that notices were nonetheless published in Spanish newspapers. Moreover, these contracts were awarded sometime before the Commission even had knowledge of them through the complaints submitted to it. In view of the above, and of the undertaking given by the Spanish authorities to the effect that Trasagua will in future meet its obligations under Community law, and of particular evidence received by the Commission concerning the later publication of Trasagua contracts in the Official Journal of the EU, the Commission did not consider it appropriate, at this stage, to bring infringement proceedings in respect of the specific case of Trasagua. It took the view that it was preferable to bring infringement proceedings with regard to the aspects of Spanish legislation, in their entirety, which are at the origin of this matter. In the meantime, the Spanish authorities have announced their commitment to amend their national laws, to apply the concept of "body governed by public law" consistently with the public procurement directives. This is welcomed by the Commission who will co-operate with Spanish authorities to ensure that these reforms are brought in swiftly and consistently with EC law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This will affect 500 people at other plants, too. The group's directors believe that this will lead to an increase in productivity and competitiveness. Between 1998 and 2001 the French pharmaceutical division's activities accounted on average for over 40% of the entire Merck KgaA group's operating profit. The planned redundancies should be outlawed through the issue of a threat to the employers that their profits will be requisitioned for the purpose of paying the threatened workers' wages.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has no power to prevent management decisions taken by individual companies. It would, however, like to recall that, over the years, the European Union has developed a comprehensive policy for dealing adequately with the social consequences of corporate restructuring. As a result of that on-going policy, every restructuring operation must be preceded by effective information and consultation of employees' representatives with the aim of avoiding or attenuating its social impact, in accordance with Community Directives on "Collective Redundancies"<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, "Transfers of Undertakings"<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, "European Works Councils"<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and, from March 2005 onwards, "Information and Consultation"<a href="#defann_51_4" name="refann_51_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the last one, these Directives have been duly transposed into the relevant national laws. The information and consultation Directive must in turn be implemented before 23 March 2005. Therefore, it is up to national authorities, at this stage, to ensure that the rights therein can be fully exercised.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission advocates the idea that, when restructuring, enterprises should always take into account the effects that those decisions could have on their employees as well as on the social and regional context. This has been underlined in the Commission Communication concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): A business contribution to Sustainable Development<a href="#defann_51_5" name="refann_51_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission invited the European social partners to engage in a dialogue on anticipating and managing change with a view to applying a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring. The social partners have just informed the Commission that they have jointly identified a set of reference orientations which should guide companies and their workers when restructuring. The Commission very much hopes that those results as well as further work to be developed in this field contribute to disseminating throughout Europe good practices of corporate restructuring, thus helping companies and their workers to adequately address its social dimension.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Based on the information forwarded to the Commission by the honourable Member, a company intends to establish this type of plant in Larymna. However, that intention has not been confirmed by the initiation of an authorisation procedure or an environmental impact assessment. If the company concerned wishes to build such a facility, the procedures laid down in Directive 85/337/EEC must be followed. In view of the above, the Commission does not consider it to be possible at present to establish that there has been a violation of Directive 85/337/EEC.</p>

<p>The Commission services are also not informed about projects, particularly private investor projects, that are at the proposal stage for ERDF cofinancing.

<p>(FR) Three youth organisations, Responsible Young Drivers, Team Alert and 'La Route des Jeunes' recently organised the first 'European accident-free night' initiative in Belgium, Denmark, France and the Netherlands with the backing of the Commission. The aim of the operation was to reduce the number of young people killed on the roads during the night between Saturday 25 October and Sunday 26 October, in particular those returning from discotheques. More than 500 volunteers and 80 discotheques took part in the initiative.</p>
<p>According to the information available so far, the level of mobilisation set by the organisers was achieved. The operation was favourably received by young people. Although, unfortunately, a fatal accident occurred in Belgium, the number of young people involved in road accidents was below average.</p>
<p>The overall picture is therefore positive and the Commission would like to express its gratitude and encouragement to the organisations, volunteers and large numbers of young people who took part in the operation</p>
<p>The organisers have expressed the desire to repeat the initiative in 2004 and extend it to four new countries by means of patronage. The Commission intends to meet them as soon as the final results of the first 'European accident-free night' emerge, in order to discuss the details of possible support for the initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0700"></a>

<p>(FR) On 23 July 2003, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on reduced levels of VAT. The main aim of this proposal is to improve the internal market, in particular by seeking to simplify VAT and apply it in a more standard manner. The Commission has therefore chosen to focus on the inconsistencies regarding rates in the current system in order to make significant progress along that route.</p>
<p>In consequence of a transitory exemption, catering services currently enjoy a reduced rate of VAT in eight Member States, while current Community legislation forbids the seven other Member States from introducing a reduced rate. The Commission has therefore proposed reinstating catering services on the new list of goods and services eligible for reduced rates.</p>
<p>It is now up to the Council to decide, unanimously and in the light of the view taken by the European Parliament, on the future scope of application for reduced rates of VAT.</p>
<p>The Commission does not envisage introducing certification or excluding fast food chains from the lower rate of VAT. According to the principle of subsidiarity, it is up to the Member States who decide to apply a reduced rate in the catering sector to precisely define its scope of application.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member that reduced rates are optional: each Member State therefore has the power to decide whether or not to apply a reduced rate to the goods and services on the restrictive list in Annex H of the sixth VAT Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0709"></a>

These people are also deprived of the right to take part in the political affairs of their country. The means and the pretext used to deprive them of that right are humiliating and exceptionally difficult specialised examinations in knowledge of the language, the constitution and history as interpreted by the powers that be. Communist parties are banned in the Baltic States and party activists are prosecuted on trumped-up charges.

<p>However, the Commission confirms that the current Czech Public Procurement Law includes a national preferences clause and that due to that clause, foreign suppliers may face difficulties in obtaining public procurement contracts. Consequently the Commission has repeatedly indicated to the Czech Republic that the new Czech Act on Public Procurement must provide equal access for Community companies through the abolition of the national preference clause and implementation of all the provisions of the Public Procurement Directives. Although a new Act on Public Procurement seeking to ensure full implementation of the Public Procurement Directives was recently adopted by the Czech Chamber of Deputies, the legislative process still needs to be finalised, as it now needs to be further adopted by the Senate and signed by the President of the Republic. The national Czech Office for the Protection of Economic Competition monitors if public contracts are awarded in conformity with the Act on Public Procurement.</p>
<p>The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition is also the competent authority until accession for the monitoring of state aids. In this regard the Commission has stated that reinforced efforts on the Czech side are required to ensure a fully satisfactory enforcement of the law.</p>

<p>When the Commission decided to introduce a duty of EUR 32.60 per tonne on coke from China, it based its decision on the assumption that the price of coke – as a result of the duty – would increase by 5.6% only (Commission decision 2730/2000/ECSC<a href="#defann_61_1" name="refann_61_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). I questioned whether this decision was in the interests of the Community (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0868_EN.html">H-0868/00</a><a href="#defann_61_2" name="refann_61_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>). In the answer to my question, the Commission reassured me that the impact of the duty on the user industry would be limited. However, since the introduction of the duty, the price of coke has increased by 50% and is still increasing. The imposition of the duty has apparently damaged the competitiveness of the European iron-casting and insulation materials industries and has left the market open to Chinese producers.</p>
<p>In the light of this, does the Commission still find it in the Community’s interests to maintain the duty? If not, will the Commission change its decision in light of the dramatic change in the basic assumptions behind the original decision?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In December 2000, a definitive anti-dumping duty of Euro 32.6 per tonne was imposed on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in China.</p>
<p>In December 2002, the Commission initiated an interim review following a request from the Community industry alleging that the dumping had continued and had even increased and that the measures in force were not sufficient to counteract the injurious dumping.</p>
<p>The Commission has carried out an investigation but at the time of its determination it was informed of allegations of shortage of supply of Chinese coke on the Community market as well as changes in the market situation, in particular with regard to prices. As these allegations were considered serious, a supplementary investigation requesting information from all parties concerned has just been completed.</p>
<p>As a result, the Commission is contemplating either repealing or suspending the measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
