<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – </span>Mr President, the principles of integrated coastal zone management are accepted worldwide as a mechanism to enable sustainable management of coastal areas. Europe is currently well behind other developed nations in implementing them. For instance, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all implemented major legislation to progress integrated management of coastal and marine areas. Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 commits coastal signatories to integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas. The EU’s demonstration programme on integrated management of coastal zones, funded by LIFE, has proved that implementation of integrated coastal zone management results in both economic and environmental benefits. The EU should be taking advantage of these benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The coastal zone requires special management. There is an urgent need to integrate planning and management and promote collaborative working of marine and terrestrial assistance at local, regional and national levels. Through good practices of coastal zone management, we should work towards sustainable management of the coastal zone. Europe should provide specific leadership to ensure good management of the coast. This will only be possible if the integrated coastal zone management process is backed up with appropriate legislation. The EU must establish a legal framework to enable action at other levels. This recommendation should be seen as a first stage in the development of that framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I am astonished at some of the opposition to the idea of binding legislation because it is essential to secure adequate funding for integrated coastal zone management initiatives across Europe. Integrated coastal zone management initiatives usually focus on a central coordinating mechanism which requires comparatively low levels of core funding. Yet the integrated coastal zone initiatives already in existence are floundering, due mainly to lack of financial support. For instance, the EU-funded integrated coastal zone management projects such as the Atlantic Living Coastline in the UK and others have since ceased. The UK initiative and the Severn Estuary strategy, involving 12 local authorities, have only secured funding for the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should adopt binding measures to ensure good coastal zone management. This should happen not later than three years after the adoption of the current recommendation on integrated coastal zone management. This would be preceded by a national stock-taking to analyse which actors, laws and institutions influence the planning and management of the coastal zone in order to ensure convergence of public bodies and local initiatives, to be completed by the end of December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, the Bantry Bay coastal zone chart is the only agreed integrated coastal zone management plan in the whole of the country at the present time. Even in countries such as the UK, where the EU programmes have funded some of the most important coastal zone management and regeneration projects, local authorities are unable to give priority to funding integrated coastal zone management actions because of the absence of a national policy framework, statutory duties, responsibilities or adequate funding. For this reason local authorities strongly support EU leadership to ensure cross-European commitment by national governments to give funding and legislative support in this field. Some people have criticised me for saying that I want to give the EU more power in this area. My colleague, Mr Davies – who is not here tonight – has criticised me in committee. I was beginning to wonder if I was the Euro-sceptic or was he?</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to environmental protection, it is extremely important that the EU is given some sort of control. In my own country the government failed to take recommendations and even directives seriously and implement them in a way that actually achieves their original aim. A recommendation is basically non-binding. So you will have the situation where Member States do not take seriously the management of a coast. We cannot say that if we manage our own coasts, that is sufficient. It has a knock-on effect in other areas, especially where there are shared coastlines. It is completely unacceptable that some Member States have a very good integrated coastal zone management strategy and plans, whereas other countries do not. That is completely unfair. When it comes to environmental issues we need an international approach. There is no point in trying to tackle it at only a national level. As everyone knows, environmental issues cross all boundaries. There is no such thing as national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area we are not saying that we want to hand over total control to Europe but we need binding legislation. Otherwise governments just ignore it. Recommendations are just something that they comply with if it suits them, but not if they do not. In relation to coastal zones it is extremely important. Europe has experienced a great increase in pressures on coastal resources. From 1960 to 1990 it has been estimated that one kilometre of unspoilt coastline has been developed every day and 30 hectares of dune habitat have disappeared every day. Coastal populations have also further increased and, at present, about 50% of the EU’s population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast. So there really is an urgent need to tackle coastal zone management.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft recommendation leaves out a very important issue in that it fails to identify the threatened biodiversity of our coastal zones. The coastal zone is one of the most dynamic areas of the earth’s surface with an abundance of unique flora and fauna which need to be protected. This has to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is climate change. We can no longer ignore threats from climate change on coastal erosion. This has to be taken into account. Everyone, at this stage, will recognise that climate change is having a major impact on our coastal areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of all industries that rely on the coast we have to take action, and take it now. We can see the quick destruction of our coasts. This involves the destruction of industries that rely on our coasts such as tourism, fishing industries and others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that something happens as a result of this recommendation, that there is some sort of legal framework. Member States who are reluctant to do this do not want to face up to the fact that our coasts have to be protected. They want to "cop-out" of their responsibilities. This should not be allowed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Be it the Irish Cliffs of Moher, the Algarve in Portugal or the Watt mud flats on the German coast, Europe’s coasts have tremendous economic, ecological, social and cultural importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Coasts are not conurbation areas, but nevertheless around one third of the EU population live in coastal regions today. This presents dangers for the fragile ecosystems that coasts represent. However, the socio-economic problems have grown too, because coastal regions are far removed from the heartbeat of the conurbations and are neglected by politics. I need mention only the coastal regions’ lack of infrastructure links. So we must do something for the coasts in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the growing problems, we urgently need to find a system of planning and management that includes everyone connected with the coasts. We must create an integrated management to ensure sustainable development and preserve the coasts as habitat. In Germany we have a saying: too many cooks spoil the broth. I hear the voices of critics raising their fingers in warning and quoting this proverb. But I say to them, the proverb may apply to broth but not to our coasts. The problem areas differ a great deal, and a wide variety of sectors are affected, but the links between them are obvious. Tourists come to my coast, for example, for the crabs. The artificial deepening of rivers or the discharge of harmful substances threatens the stock of crabs. No crabs, no tourists, no money! And there are no alternative job opportunities, certainly not in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with wide-ranging problems that cannot be solved, at least not adequately, by the Member States alone. What we need is a joining of forces on the coast, and clearly that will not happen without friction. But it will benefit our environment in the long term. We will not get very far or make much progress in Europe if we all keep ploughing our own furrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it is rather late in the evening to talk about coastal zone management in Europe, I believe that it is a subject of particular importance which really needs a legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Why a legal framework? Quite simply because the development of our coastal zones is sometimes carried out in such a way as to cause the degradation of those zones, despite the fact that, as a fellow Member has pointed out, the habitat of the coastal zones is sometimes a long way away from the major centres of population. This is not the case in every country, however. I come from a country where there are major population centres alongside coastal zones, and those population centres have finally destroyed the quality of the coastal zones, resulting in numerous cases of degradation caused by human activity. This degradation has very serious consequences for biodiversity, for the conservation of species, whether of fauna or of flora, serious consequences for the quality of the landscape, and very serious consequences for water quality. On that point, we have the framework directive on water, the one on bathing water, and you know, especially at this time of the year when the tourists start to invade our beaches, how important the quality of bathing water is. All this is very important, and it is also important for the quality of our fishery resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that it is necessary to have a real political will, on the part of all the countries of the European Union and within the candidate countries, because among those countries which will shortly be joining us within the European Union there are coastal countries and islands which are facing the same problems, the problems that arise between economic development and the protection of our coastal zones. Economic development and protection are not actually opposed to one another, but there has to be a real desire to develop carefully, at the same time fully respecting the need to protect the landscape, biodiversity and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">This will certainly require a legal framework. On that point I agree with other Members. However, we must have a legal framework which respects the disparities between our countries, because the coasts of the Scandinavian countries do not have the same problems as those of the countries of southern Europe, whether that means France, Spain, Italy or Greece. We must give a little more responsibility to local authorities and ask each State to set up a legal framework which is appropriate to the regional and local scale. In France, a coastline conservation authority was set up 25 years ago. It has resources to acquire coastal zones which have to be protected, and resources to ensure that, afterwards, land-use plans comply with legal regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we should be doing. I believe that our coastal zones represent environmental and economic wealth which we absolutely must protect in the spirit of a sustainable development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commission highlights in its proposal, this is not just a local problem, but is of critical importance for all Europeans. As Mrs Langenhagen said, one third of EU citizens live close to, if not on, these areas. Research has revealed a worrying deterioration in the environmental, socio-economic and cultural resources of our coastal zones. We see aggressive competition between users of these resources. The environmental problems include habitat destruction, water contamination, coastal erosion and resource depletion and these are all very serious. These environmental problems have a knock-on effect beyond coastal regions to inland regions. The roots of the problem include a lack of knowledge, a failure to involve stake-holders and, therefore, a lack of cooperation between the relevant administrative bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">At a recent videoconference in Scotland House, that is the home of the Scottish Executive in Brussels, it was interesting to see how the different local authorities in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland were already working within local partnerships with stake-holders to protect the coastal zone. It gave me great encouragement that action was being taken and that the coastal zone was being given the importance it rightly deserved.

<p class="contents">In conclusion, we need to encourage strong action at a local level which we are seeing already in Scotland, and we need to exchange best practice across the EU in order that our coastal zones can be enjoyed as much by this generation as by the next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think that this evening’s debate, once again involving almost exclusively women, shows that we who are taking part in this discussion may well be descended from these brave and strong women of the coasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, political movements which have long supported the very principles found in this document have been mocked in many contexts. The movement which I represent nationally has long stood for the principles about which we are now speaking, but we have had to suffer a great deal of ridicule. It is important that we support the binding recommendations that there is a wish to introduce for Member States, so that we can get away from a situation in which the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and in which fishermen are perhaps in even more danger of extinction than many animal species. We have an unequal situation with unequal protection of what is to be found in the coastal areas. We also have a situation whereby we want more sea traffic without wanting to provide protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur asked why our group opposes a binding legal framework, but the explanations she has given have not convinced us. We need a legal basis for the matter, but not binding legislation. We must rely on local action and joint local planning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is impossible to deal with this issue within the narrow context of the existing Member States. This is an area in which decisions could be necessary and legitimate at the level of a whole continent, or even of the entire planet.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is also an area in which the European institutions have least power, although they are very fond of finicky regulations in other areas where centralisation is not required. In this way they demonstrate that they do not represent an authority which imposes its will on national States, each with its particularisms and selfish interests, but rather that they are the result of those interests. The European institutions, like the national States, are in the service of the private interests of the major industrial and financial groups. They are incapable of imposing on those groups the policies which are of utmost importance to society as a whole, and there is a real risk that future generations will die as a result. The solving of major ecological problems is totally incompatible with the private ownership of the major means of production and the use of those means with the exclusive aim of making a profit. The cases involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> were a good illustration of the extent to which private interests are opposed to collective interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, to vote in favour of a strategy for integrated coastal zone management would be pure hypocrisy. We shall be abstaining from the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have yet to decide how to provide this vital protection. Will it respect local populations and their activities, or are we going to put nature in a glass case, as the Natural 2000 network intends to do? It will, of course, be necessary to have rules and regulations in order to keep the situation under control and to avoid anarchic development. In France we did this with our Coastlines Act, which has produced some good results, even if our Green Minister for the Environment, Mrs Voynet, has just allowed an exception to get through in the form of the Corsica Act.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these essential regional planning measures have to be the subject of debate with the elected representatives and citizens concerned, because they are the ones who have to live with the coastline on a day-to-day basis, and it is absolutely essential to involve them in this protection if we want it to be admired and respected. Let us not forget that they are the ones who, when the <span class="italic">Erika </span>was shipwrecked, organised and took part in the operation to clean up the beaches and coastlines. In my opinion, it is better to convince than to constrain. That way we gain more support, and therefore more effectiveness and more local democracy. Restrictions from Brussels are always suspect and often unsuitable, because they have been drafted far away from the local area and the local mentality. This local approach is essential if we want to see common-sense measures negotiated and accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also respect traditional local practices, because they express the economic, social and cultural reality. They are an integral part of the coastline, and are often the best guarantee that our natural areas will be respected. In practical terms, we must apply the rules of subsidiarity and decentralisation, although consistency remains essential. Responsibility for management should remain at national level and should include a large degree of local consensus. This is why we shall be voting against this report, which we believe is too restrictive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, there is one of our local authority areas that has 26 inhabited islands and a coastline as long as that of France. Scotland, as a whole, has 462 different coastal plans in place, almost three quarters of them locally based.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst management of coastal zones must remain predominantly local, national strategies to support and coordinate action are vital. We are fortunate in having a Scottish coastal forum to perform this role. But such good work can be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Firth of Clyde forum recently explained, we lack any measure of security, political or financial, which would give us a strong footing for pursuing longer-term management.

<p class="contents">The coastal zone is very important for Europe, as other speakers have said. Its resources provide us with food, energy and homes and create opportunities. However, according to the reports of the European Environmental Agency, conditions in the coastal zone and its resources continue to decline. Conditions in the coastal zone can only be improved through a concentrated effort involving all levels of the relevant sectors of government based on the principles of integrated coastal zone management.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that this integrated coastal zone management is not a procedure for land-use planning <span class="italic">per se</span>. It is more a methodology for introducing a coherent approach to the management and use of coastal resources with the informed involvement of all the relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to encourage Member States to assume their full responsibility in promoting integrated coastal zone management, the Commission has introduced the proposed recommendation. This calls on Member States to develop national strategies for coastal zone management based on an inventory of the actors, laws and institutions involved in the management and planning of the coastal zones. This strategy aims to introduce a coherent approach to the coastal zones across Europe but the recommendation intentionally leaves the choice of the format of the national strategies to the Member States to ensure that each national strategy is tailor-made to the institutional, physical and social conditions within each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the recommendation presents a list of features which the Member States are encouraged to address through their national strategies, such as the need for coherence between the many plans, policies and programmes for management of the coasts and the need for coordination between the actors that use and manage the coast, particularly those with responsibility for the sea and the land which forms part of the coastal zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the key issues raised in the amendments proposed. I would like to start by noting that the Commission can accept many of the proposed amendments. Indeed, many of the proposed amendments strengthen the text by clarifying concepts and introducing further information. We thank Parliament for putting forward these amendments. There are, however, certain amendments which the Commission cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of the amendments proposed, namely Amendments Nos 11, 12, 16, 18, 29, 32, 43 and 49, introduce references to a future Community legislative framework. These amendments are unacceptable to the Commission for the obvious reason that they prejudge the issue of whether a legislative approach is required. In addition, a reference to a Community legislative framework would not be appropriate in view of the wide diversity of conditions in the Member States and the Commission’s philosophy of coastal zone management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s present decision to propose a recommendation was based on a thorough assessment of the needs for action at the European level through the demonstration programme on integrated coastal zone management and on a broad public consultation. In the same spirit, the Commission cannot accept amendments which introduce compulsory language. "Shall" is not the right word in a non-binding instrument, such as a recommendation and therefore the use of this word in Amendments Nos 29, 32 and 34 cannot be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the references in Amendments Nos 17, 20, 33 and 45 indicating the need for binding instruments within the Member States ignore the fact that integrated coastal zone management may be best introduced through voluntary measures in some Member States. These parts of these amendments are therefore not acceptable either. Otherwise, the six amendments are acceptable in principle or in part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is concerned that Amendments Nos 16 and 42 might give an incorrect, narrow impression of the breadth of the integrated coastal zone management approach. In particular, in Amendments Nos 25 and 47, while the Commission accepts the need to involve all the parties concerned, this text should not be limited to the special planning process, but should make broader reference to all of the actors involved in the planning and management of the coastal zones and its resources. The Commission would also note that it cannot accept two amendments, which make inappropriate reference to other Community policies which are better discussed in a different context. The reference to the INTERREG Programme in Amendment No 16 is inappropriate as the guidelines for INTERREG have been set out elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the reference in Amendment No 35 to the common fisheries policy and the 12-mile derogation is not acceptable as it prejudges the debate on the revision of this policy. In addition, Amendments Nos 47 and 48 are not acceptable, at least in part, because they could lead to the endorsement of unsustainable traditional practices including those relating to hunting and fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the remaining amendments – and this list is longer than the non-acceptable amendments – the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3 to 10, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 46; and in addition, it can accept Amendments Nos 2, 14, 24, 36, and 44 in principle. As a result, two thirds of the amendments can be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Parliament has significantly contributed to improving this proposal. I would, therefore, like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and the draftsmen from the other committees for their efforts. I am sure that the final text will be an important step in encouraging the application of integrated coastal zone management in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
