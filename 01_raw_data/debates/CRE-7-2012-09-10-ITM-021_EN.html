<p class="contents">I should first of all like to tell you that I am personally extremely satisfied with the work of the shadow rapporteurs and all those who have contributed to the debate, whether they are from the Commission or the Council. Together, we have achieved this outcome. What is more, within the space of a year, we have managed to approve one of the two most important dossiers for the internal market, and secured the approval itself at first reading, thereby making the legislative process simpler.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I can clearly declare that this is a real achievement for Parliament, which has played a significant part in arriving at the definitive text of the regulation. As a consequence, Parliament’s role has clearly been reinforced and my wish is that this important institution, which is the one that actually represents the people of Europe, can, in future, have an ever greater impetus and greater involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall now briefly go on to highlight a certain particular aspect of the regulation and bring out the importance of these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, when this regulation takes effect, the system will continue to be based on principles that have now been reinforced; it will therefore be voluntary, private and based on the principle of national delegation. In fact, our intention was not to upset a system that was working and had worked quite well. Rather, it was to identify the adjustments needed to make it more democratic and competitive at the European and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have ensured that stakeholders – that is to say, interested parties – who also have public importance both in the consultation phase, before the mandate is drawn up, and subsequently, can participate more actively and effectively. This is a very important point because it reinforces the democratic nature of the process and the consensus around a standard on the part of all the parties involved, whether they are market players or public players and of public importance. In order to ensure that this consultation takes place in all phases of the process, Parliament has asked the European Commission to create a notification system that will enable stakeholders to register and thereby receive information automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, just as it is proper to ensure that businesses and representatives of the public interest may participate in the system, it is equally important to ensure the presence of authorities and public bodies exercising legislative or administrative functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another particularly important point is the protection afforded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and making their participation in the process simpler. This is something that I personally quite forcefully wanted to include in the regulation, particularly at the national level, because SMEs, either due to their relative size or linguistic difficulties, find it very difficult to take an active part in the system, even though they in fact constitute the economic base on which our European system rests.</p>
<p class="contents">The European level must play its part in ensuring this element of representation, which must, however, take the bottom level as its starting point. This is why we have chosen a bottom-up structure. The system that will take effect will be more coordinated between the different levels involved, from the national level to the European level, and will also be better connected with the international level; this is one of our great ongoing objectives, because it is essential that the European Union promotes and extends its own standards worldwide, so that they become universal standards.</p>
<p class="contents">An important dialogue has been opened with the United States, particularly via the mission that we sent to Washington together with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we are proceeding down that particular road.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has, however, rejected the Council’s request to have implementing acts on technical specifications in the field of ICT, that is to say, for information and communication technologies, because it would have added a tremendous burden to the work of the Commission and slowed down the entire process. Nevertheless, Parliament has ensured that there will be a consultation phase before the Commission can decide whether or not to single out a particular technology.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe I can confirm that the regulation will simplify the entire system in both administrative and financial terms and ensure a higher level of transparency. For example, we have seen to it that the list of harmonised standards that have been subject to a formal objection decision is published on the Commission’s website.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go on talking any further, if only because there are a great number of important issues and I would risk straying too far into the technical aspects of a very complex dossier. I shall therefore leave space for the debate and remain at your disposal for any clarification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You all know that standardisation is one of the major instruments underpinning the European economy. The cooperation between industry users, public authorities and the standardisation organisations in drawing up standards has contributed decisively to what I think you will all agree is one of Europe’s greatest achievements: the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Standards play a vital role in enhancing the competitiveness of European enterprises; they assist access to today’s globalised markets and ensure interoperability, which is vital for competition and developing new products and services. For SMEs, standards are a key tool to help them retain and attract consumers. The reduced risk and increased trust and satisfaction flowing from the use of standards opens markets for them in a secure environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because of this importance, standardisation must adapt to the new societal changes that we face: the globalised economy, the need for sustainable development, the convergence of technologies protecting the consumer and improving accessibility and inclusion for disabled and elderly people. To address these issues, the Commission adopted the Standardisation Package in June 2011, and I am glad to see that the European Parliament is now discussing the adoption of the final piece of that package: the regulation on European standardisation. This regulation would help to address and solve three problems.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the speed of mandated standardisation. The planning and transparency of Commission mandates asking the European standardisation organisations to draw up standards in support of the legislation and policies will be improved through the annual work programme and by means of financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the inclusiveness of European standardisation. The opinion of relevant societal stakeholders is today not sufficiently integrated in the process, and this regulation will improve this representation of SMEs and societal stakeholders at both European and national level.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The third element concerns public procurement. You know that many information and communication technology standards ensuring interoperability are elaborated not by the European standardisation organisations but by global forums and consortiums, and these specifications do not then fit into our categories of standards to which public authorities may refer in their calls for tender.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation will provide an evaluation procedure, after which public authorities will be able to use such ICT specifications in public procurement provided they comply with a set of criteria based on the World Trade Organisation principles for the standardisation process. The regulation also affirms the existing possibility for the Union to use service standardisation as a policy tool within harmonised service sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Like so many in Parliament, the Commission regrets the Council’s determination to impose bureaucratic comitology procedures on mandates which we think are both unjustified and will undermine the efficiency of the system due to their time-consuming nature. This is why we are going to make full use of the review clause inserted – thankfully – by Parliament to evaluate the impact of comitology on mandates, with a view to making possible new proposals within two years. Nevertheless, given that most of the key elements of the original proposal have been accepted, and in a spirit of compromise and in order to facilitate a first-reading agreement, the Commission is willing to accept the text as agreed between Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also improve quality and facilitate the protection of consumer health and safety. However, technological developments are moving faster than the processes for defining standards, which creates market conflicts. When European standards are defined adequately and quickly, and I emphasise the word ‘quickly’, this creates a more civilised single market, reduces the costs of manufacturing and services, facilitates interoperability and consequently boosts competitiveness. It is very important to abolish barriers to the trading of goods and provision of services between Member States, and gives rise to the need for harmonisation. Standardisation is a process where national standardisation bodies must play a part, alongside the European body. Unfortunately, however, the national bodies are largely neglected in the Commission’s proposal, and there are no improved mechanisms which would generate adequate feedback between the EU centre and Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, at the end of this process, despite all the legitimate objections from Ms Reding, we will be able to say that, from Parliament’s point of view, a good result overall has been achieved with this measure, which is now in the hands of Commissioner Barnier in connection with the Single Market Act.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am also happy to tell you why I believe that we can congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Comi, on this result. First of all, we managed to achieve a situation where something that we have frequently demanded in the past – namely, that we need more regulations, which are directly applicable, rather than directives, which have to be transposed – could finally become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we managed – and this is, after all, also always important for a dossier adopted at first reading at the end of the trialogue – to strengthen Parliament’s rights. In the past, the situation was that the Council was the only institution that could block standardisation proposals. Under the proposal before you today, which we are debating and on which we will be voting tomorrow, Parliament, too, has the ability to block proposals on standardisation by means of a resolution of this House, where, for example, proposals were brought forward again to regulate crime prevention measures in the establishment of development plans in one form or another under standardisation law, something which gave rise to some criticism from the Member States a few years back.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to us, however, that this proposal for a regulation accommodates economic policy goals for the whole of Europe. For one thing, it ensures that harmonised standards must remain market-oriented. We believe it is very important that we have ensured greater involvement of special interest groups, but that, at the same time, these groups can only assist with the actual standardisation process. We also believe it is very important that we have ensured, through the introduction of a notification system for third parties, that standards must also prove themselves in society, be supervised by society, and be accepted by society. Through this proposal, we can ensure that stakeholders, including the authorities, have full access to the European standardisation process. We can also ensure – and this is very important to us across group lines – that small and medium-sized enterprises have full access here and that the European standardisation landscape takes account of their special interests. Unfortunately, that was not always the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, overall, it is true that this measure only consists of 12 key measures – levers – from the first Single Market Act. We must therefore avoid giving the impression that we have reached a milestone for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is one element, a building block of a strategy, that we absolutely need to consolidate in the Single Market Act II. I hope that we also gain the approval of the House for the Single Market Act II and all the measures that we will be adopting here in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes down to it, you could say that the EU’s standards and standardisation work are really one of the hidden successes of European cooperation. Without standardisation, our everyday lives would be much more difficult. It ensures, for example, that we can use our USB memory sticks in any PC we like. It also ensures that the thread on our light bulbs is standardised, so that we can buy any light fitting we like and still be sure of finding a bulb that fits.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also standards that are there generally to make the products on the European market safer, for everything from toys to house building, and there are standards that help to ensure that we can test our food and that the environment is protected. That is why it is also very important that we have been able to look at our legislation and have been able to revise the existing standardisation legislation at European level. We can thereby make it even easier to be a consumer, even safer to be a worker and, moreover, we can make it even easier to be a business that produces goods for the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight three things in the proposal that we have now negotiated which I think are good. First and foremost, it is essential that we have made the political mandate-giving process more transparent; that must be the case when we make political decisions on the mandates that are to be given. Secondly, it is also very important that we have secured broader participation in the standardisation work, and it was important to us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to ensure that consumers, workers, environmental organisations, etc. are involved to a greater extent in the decision making in respect of standards. That was very important to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that it was also important for us to ensure that we did not create an almost open back door when it comes to giving political mandates in the area of services. We wanted to stick to the principle that the Member States retain their powers in all matters that relate to defining the fundamental principles of social conditions, social security, health systems, etc. The amendments that Parliament has managed to push through have ensured that we make no changes to the Member States’ powers in this area. You could say that we have achieved a win-win situation. Workers, consumers, environmental organisations and businesses will gain a lot from this revision of the legislation on standardisation, which will mean that we can produce standards more easily, better and more quickly. In reality, all that is left is to say congratulations. Congratulations to European businesses, congratulations to European consumers and congratulations to European workers on legislation that makes it safer to be a citizen in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Standards are an important and proven tool. They facilitate a common technical language, a common technical basis within Europe’s internal market, and they are a useful tool for promoting innovation and sustainable development. The European approach has proven itself and, in times of economic crises, existing tools should be carefully modernised without jeopardising their substance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded in doing that with standardisation. We have bolstered the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises and important social groups, and thus improved the acceptance of standardisation, but without jeopardising its structure, which is based on the voluntary cooperation of the business sector, which also bears the main part of the costs. I take the view that the participation rights of small and medium-sized enterprises, consumer and environmental associations and the trade unions could have been even greater, but I accept the compromise in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have extended standardisation to the services sector. Industry-oriented services and the IT sector, in particular, represent a significant area for standardisation. At the same time, however, it was important not to jeopardise the professions, and their creative potential. Standardisation is also a cost factor in industries such as the craft industries. Standardisation should therefore only be rolled out where there is actually market relevance in it. A multi-stakeholder platform will ensure this, and will ensure that the relevant consultations take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, we thought it important that a clear separation should be maintained between standardisation and legislation. The signal from Parliament is clear: we do not want legislation by the back door. All in all, we have achieved a good compromise, and our group will be giving it our backing in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this world, and in a society that is undergoing rapid transformation, Europe needs a comprehensive, integrating, effective and up-to-date system of standardisation. This system should ensure the correct functioning of the internal market and improve the protection of consumers and their lives. It is also essential to protect the environment. In addition, more innovation and social inclusion is very important, as is interaction and communication between networks and systems, in particular, in the area of new information and communication technologies, as has already been stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Professor Monti states in his report entitled ‘A new strategy for the single market’, European standardisation is essential for the governance of the internal market, with emphasis on the need to revise the European standardisation process, maintaining the advantages of the current system and finding the right balance between the European and national dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, the report that we are discussing here today supports and defends these objectives, which are right and appropriate: to put an end to the slowness and fragmentation that currently exists and which leads to companies incurring transaction costs and higher unit costs; to strengthen the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in standardisation activities, in particular, at national level, as well as facilitating their access to those standards, while also strengthening the participation of parties that represent the interests of society, such as consumers, environmental groups, workers and people with disabilities, while maintaining financial support for European organisations that have been established to represent public interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that the adoption of this report will contribute to the revival of the European project, to European innovation, and to the strengthening and competitiveness of our companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This example alone shows how important standardisation is and the great extent to which it can make life easier for citizens. This is a very important issue that we have to debate here. We, in Parliament, have also succeeded in adding many improvements to the Commission’s text. I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to our shadow rapporteur for their outstanding work.</p>
<p class="contents">There were, however, two points – to single out just a couple of topics, for time reasons – that were particularly close to our hearts. First of all, we had the support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which was a very important point for us – and ensuring that standardisation is not only the realm of large companies, but also respects the needs of SMEs. In cases like this, the risk is, of course, always very large that the large companies will go ahead and implement and the small companies will have to catch up, which can be a cost-intensive exercise. We have also managed to ensure that the support and the funding in this area have been safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area that was important to us was the removal of a section of the services that have recently been incorporated into this process, in particular, the removal of services of common economic interest and those of major importance to the professions. In this area, standardisation could be very dangerous, as these are fields that depend on creativity and the flexibility of service providers, and these must be safeguarded. We have reached a satisfactory compromise in this regard, and one in favour of which we, as a group, feel able to vote. As I said, though, there was a lot of work to do and I hope that things will be somewhat easier from here on in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with the elaboration of standards, and even more so with the acceleration of standardisation. However, I would like to note that this process should by no means come at the cost of quality. I therefore think that we should primarily aim to speed up the process in terms of administration; measures in this regard should be implemented jointly by the standardisation bodies and the Commission, while, of course, maintaining a consensus-based approach and publicity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is much the Commission can do to further this end, for example, by accelerating the initial and closing work phases, including the signing of contracts, performance certification and the facilitation of payments. I agree with the rapporteur that we can and should build upon the existing system, as it offers several opportunities for development. I agree that the issue of access to standards should not be confined to addressing the prices of standards, and I welcome the fact that we issued a call to the national standardisation bodies. This call concerns the reduction of costs through the application of special rates, for example, by providing bundles of standards at reduced prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the involvement of SMEs and other interest representatives in the standardisation process to be extremely important and worth supporting. As an aside, I would like to point out that there have been no substantial obstacles to their participation in the past. I believe that their passivity is due to other reasons, for example, their very limited financial resources, and I find that sometimes, their special expertise is also lacking. I am therefore of the opinion that when supporting them, we should focus primarily on these areas and aim at finding ways to boost their motivation. All things considered, the rapporteur managed to draft a report that can support European competitiveness, innovation and sustainable development at the same time. In the light of all this, and also on the basis of the rapporteur’s excellent work, I recommend the adoption of the report, and support it myself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has already been said about the benefits of standards. I would like to mention two further examples that we think are self-evident: the universal charger for mobile phones and, in future, the realisation of electromobility. Without standards, these things would absolutely not be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, not all of society knows how standards are produced. It is not this House – and nor will it be in future – it is national, European and international institutes like CEN and CENELEC that produce standards. The last 25 years has been a good period, but there were also a number of shortcomings, which we have now tidied up. The creation of standards was far too slow, far too expensive, too opaque and too unilateral in terms of participation. We have now rectified that with this proposal, and we will make access cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, we will involve the trade unions and the social partners, the consumer organisations, and we will link up with national, international and European bodies. I am also pleased about the sensible involvement in procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I will deal with acceptance. This is something that we will still have to test out and check the state thereof. Germany’s DIN institute had serious concerns at the start of the debate about the direction that acceptance was moving in. I believe those concerns have since been resolved. The SME sector in Hesse, for example, has already provided me with feedback. I found out that it is pleased with this compromise, with this proposal from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and that it sees a series of improvements for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, a few years ago, together with Commissioner Verheugen, I set up a plan to standardise the plugs for phone chargers and, in 2014, the plugs for iPad chargers.

<p class="contents">On the latter question, from Mr Manders, there is a voluntary agreement between the European Union and industry for harmonisation of chargers, and this will be of very great importance for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">There was another question on service standardisation, and I would like to tell the honourable Member that the regulation reaffirms the possibility for the Union to use service standardisation as a policy tool within harmonised service sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I could not agree more with what Mr Harbour said. This is indeed the first of 12 levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence in the Single Market Act adopted by the Commission in April 2011. This is good for industry, for consumers, and for the economy at large, but it is also – and I think many Members have underlined this – an evolution, not a revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">So the regulation builds on the main pillars of the current, successful system, and the improvement it brings will provide Europe with a single, transparent and comprehensive instrument which will not only support the implementation of policies here in Europe, but will also help promote the competitiveness of European enterprises throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope this House will adopt by a massive majority this very important piece of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This regulation will ensure that national markets and the European market will be able to interact better and ensure greater competitiveness, something that Europe is absolutely in need of.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving the whole system of setting standards facilitates and simplifies the work of our businesses and makes it more efficient. Standards have a direct impact on citizens, Ms Schaldemose is quite right on this, improving their lives, and we must also make our fellow Members understand this, so that this knowledge can be spread over the whole of our territory. At the same time, it was right to guarantee greater competitiveness on the national level for the European system.</p>
<p class="contents">I also concur with Mr Schwab that what we need are more regulations and fewer directives if we really want an internal market, as Professor Monti and Commissioner Barnier have suggested. This is the right way to arrive at a Union that is not only economic but also political, so that we can finally call it ‘European’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
