<p class="contents">It was not until the twentieth century that women acquired the right to access education, the sciences, the arts and paid employment and that they were finally recognised as beings with political rights. The 20th century began with women fighting for the right to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of the twenty-first century, the demands of half the population on the planet centre around achieving a fair division of responsibilities and obligations between the sexes in all sectors of economic, social, family and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for women to be promoted in the decision-making process and for a balanced participation of women and men in the democratic institutions, reflecting the balance of the sexes in nature, is a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>of democracy and peace and of the cohesion and competitiveness of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to this need and on the basis of documented proposals by the European network of experts which made up the Commission in 1992, the Council adopted an important recommendation to the Member States on the balanced participation of men and women in the decision-making process in December 1996. We can see from the details provided by the Member States that little progress has been made over the last three years and that there are huge discrepancies between the Member States. The most satisfactory results are in countries which have a long tradition of promoting equality of the sexes, such as Sweden and Finland, where the proportion of women in parliament and government is over 40%. Sweden, as you all know, has a cabinet of 10 male and 10 female ministers. And of course, at the other end of the spectrum, there are countries such as Greece and Italy, where the proportion of women is below or around 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem obviously relates to the upper rather than the lower echelons of administration, where the real decisions are taken, where the real power is exercised, where the future of the European Union is planned and organised. Clearly, courageous measures are needed if the problems and contradictions inherited from past covenants between the sexes are to be resolved. We need a new institutional and social framework which reflects all the changes that have taken place since, which guarantees equal opportunities and divides responsibilities fairly and evenly between the two sexes, so that any decisions taken reflect the wishes, values, priorities, interests and abilities of both sexes of the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that women are fully involved in the production process and outnumber men at European universities, there is no excuse to exclude them from policy- and decision-making processes, nor is it right that women should bear the burden of family obligations and home-making alone. According to studies and research, men and women working and taking decisions together, a balance between the male and female, could result in a more balanced and fairer world. This balance must not, of course, drop below 40% for each sex, which is considered an acceptable percentage, especially in Scandinavia, where it has been applied for years now.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certain is that, once there is a critical mass of women in the decision-making process, priority issues relating to the quality of life, such as environmental protection, social policy and welfare, medical care, education, the fight against drugs and trafficking in human beings and the peaceful resolution of conflicts will emerge on the political agenda. If we are to move in this direction, i.e. if we are to achieve a balanced participation of the sexes, we need to adopt specific initiatives and measures, such as revising the party political structure and the procedure for selecting candidates. The legislation on public funding for political parties should make provision for greater funding for parties which guarantee a gender balance within the party and for sanctions for parties which have too few women, as was recently decided in France. Governments, especially in countries in which the proportion of women is below 30%, should consider how to adapt and reform their electoral systems. Similarly, if quotas introduced are to be effective, they must be linked with other measures relating to political parties and the reform of the electoral system. We also need to tackle stereotypes by teaching the role of the sexes from an early age and to cultivate women's ability to hold high office. We need to strengthen the social infrastructure in order to care for and support senior citizens and, finally, the Member States need to take part in the next Intergovernmental Conference to reform the Treaty so that there is a strong legal basis which will guarantee a balanced participation of the two sexes in the institutions of the European Union, so that we can finally do the obvious and ensure that the natural balance of the sexes is also expressed in the centres of power and that any decisions taken on the future of Europe are not taken in the absence of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how can we strive to create a balance between men and women in their working life, both in the private sector and in public institutions, and both at European and national level? We need an effective strategy leading to positive measures. We need to combat ignorance and outmoded clichés about gender roles. Our role model should be those confident women who very effectively occupy senior positions and who actively participate in the community. However, they, and this applies equally to men, have to be able to manage their domestic commitments just as well as they cope with the professional demands placed on them.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to congratulate Mrs Karamanou on her report, which includes many important sections, such as the demand for the role of women to be enhanced or for action to be taken to counter women's inadequate representation in management and decision-making bodies within companies and also, I have to say, in trade unions. The lack of equal opportunities in the labour market needs to be tackled by developing talent early on. We also support the call for gender-specific statistics in order to produce meaningful comparisons of objectives and outcomes. We are in favour of cooperation between the two sexes and therefore want to see women's concerns, outlook and experience making a contribution. They really do enhance a man’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on some points there is not a majority amongst the Members of the PPE Group in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities. That is why one half voted for the report and the other half against – now that is equality. The main concerns are covered in the four amendments which I have tabled jointly with Astrid Lulling. Mrs Karamanou has already agreed to one of them: career and family are no longer to be described as a double disadvantage which women have to face, but rather as a twofold burden which they have to cope with and which they can indeed cope with in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment opposes the idea that women need to be trained in areas like public speaking and assertiveness if they are to get on in the world. For one thing, men also have shortcomings in these areas and, what is more, these days many women do not wait to be given financial support to do this. They are doing it themselves and have been doing so for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the two most important amendments are about rejecting the establishment of quotas. We know that there are various systems in the Member States. Some have quota arrangements of one kind or another. Some want a kind of exchange system, alternating men and women, and others stipulate that the parties have to pay fines if an adequate proportion of women is not guaranteed in their lists. The principle of subsidiarity should come into play here. Surely it is not right for individual measures in Member States to be eroded by Europe through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere, governments are called upon to review the differential impact of varying electoral systems. That is not a job for governments – it is a job for the parties. They should look at this and draw up their voting lists carefully with this in mind. It is their job and not one for governments. We regard these amendments as so important that we have requested a roll-call vote. If you could give us your support on this, Mrs Karamanou, your report could well secure an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone deeply concerned about equal opportunities needs to make sure not only that the overall objectives are right, but that the detail is right too. The more precisely we word this, the greater its credibility will be, especially among those who do not have sufficient experience in this field, and that will make it all the more likely that we will secure a broad consensus today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equal participation for women in political and social decision making is not only our legitimate right, but a social necessity. We do not just enrich a man’s world; we are participating in all areas of this supposedly male world.</p>
<p class="contents">As the new millennium dawns, we are continuing to fight alongside our colleague Mrs Karamanou, who I would like to thank sincerely for her persistence and hard work, in order to move closer to the objective of equality in the distribution of power between men and women. It has been a long haul from the first women's suffrage, in Finland in 1904, to gender-balanced political lists in France, and we still have a long way to go before we can take women presidents, mayors, ministers and party chairs for granted as a part of everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made considerable progress in this regard. We have now been able to increase the proportion of women in the European Parliament to 30%, and it is, incidentally, markedly higher in the left-wing groups than in the Conservative and more right-wing groups. 25% of the Commission is made up of women, and the figure is 24.8% in the governments of the Member States and 22.5% in national parliaments. I am pleased to bear glad tidings from my own country. Since the last government reshuffle in Germany, women now make up 37.5% of the Federal German Government, and this has been achieved by my party, by my political family.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore confident about our own role and can act as a driving force for equal rights and the demands arising from the Karamanou report. I must call upon the House to support the rapporteur, Mrs Karamanou, as regards the three issues just raised by Mr Mann, and stick to the original text presented by the committee. It would be a mistake to reject quotas, as the parties are being urged to do. Furthermore, we also supported quotas as advocated in the report to the World Conference on Women in Beijing. The right thing is to keep all mechanisms open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is exemplary in the way it is written. The report clearly emphasises the big differences between the Member States, but there is one thing all the countries have in common: there is no equality, including in those countries which are furthest along the road, and here I am thinking, for example, of the Scandinavian countries. In Scandinavia, we have made a lot of progress at parliamentary level, both on the back and the front benches. Only Sweden and Finland are mentioned, and Denmark is included in an aside. I should therefore like to say a couple of things about Denmark. I want to stress that 9 of the 21 ministers in the Danish government are women and that both the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance are women. My own party has 4 female ministers at the moment and one male minister, plus a female leader of the parliamentary party and a female party chairman, and I am the only woman elected to the European Parliament. We have fortunately never gone in for quota systems for, if that were the case, I believe that men would have begun to take advantage of the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Scandinavian countries too, however, there are very few women in management posts, particularly at the highest level. Denmark has nothing to boast about, and nor has Sweden, as far as I can see. As was pointed out yesterday, the Swedish Prime Minister’s delegation consisted only of men. We clearly have a problem, therefore. I personally believe that this has to do with the demands made of women in the hierarchical system. But that is, of course, something we can discuss. Globalisation and ICT will pull in two different directions. Clearly, ICT has a flat structure, and that is to women’s advantage. Globalisation has a concentrated structure, which is to the disadvantage of women who thoroughly lose out in the hierarchical system. In conclusion, I want to say that my most important message is that cooperation at European level can be extremely useful to us, but we must recognise that the different countries face very different problems, and quite different initiatives are therefore required. We must distinguish between those things from which we can all benefit in the Community, for example statistics that can be compared, and those areas in which we can clearly only offer each other inspiration. That attitude will be of no less immediate importance in connection with enlargement. Here, we are concerned with countries which may well have the legislation in place, but not the tangible arrangements, and joint aid on our part is really needed in this area.</p>

One of its main themes is the need for an integrated strategy. If we are to tackle the very serious imbalance of representation of men and women, not only in the political sphere but also in decision-making at all levels in society, this is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that just last year the Finnish presidency looked at nine sectors in the Member States, including national, regional and local parliaments, the civil service and the supreme courts. Wherever it looked it found women were under-represented. The problems have been recognised for a long time, but progress on solving them has been slow.</p>
<p class="contents">We repeat ourselves constantly in these reports, calling for better statistics and training, awareness campaigns to encourage more women into politics in the same way as they have already very often become key players in their own communities and local groups, and for measures to make it easier for men and to women to balance work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to keep on saying these things because they are needed. But, in addition, we need positive action, such as quotas, to make a real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does not dictate what should be done in individual Member States, but calls upon the governments to look at their own situation and take action to improve the balance of women and men, using legislative means, if necessary, as some have already done.</p>
<p class="contents">Where these measures have been used, they have been successful, not only in getting more women elected to Parliament but also in raising awareness, providing good role models for other women – girls in particular – and improving debate and decision-making all around. So the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support all the conclusions of the report because it will contribute towards achieving equality and real democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘A social system based on hierarchical relations between men, structured so that the decision-making processes are controlled from the top down and so that women as a sex are placed in a subordinate position. The ideological justification is provided by a system of values designed by male thinkers and founded on men’s perception of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The material basis of this system consists of a division of labour according to gender which, at all levels of the hierarchies, assigns to women the tasks which are either unpaid or more poorly paid. One of the prerequisites of this is control of women’s sexuality and fertility. This control in turn requires structural violence against women, on the one hand, and that women practise self-repression, on the other.’</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to come back briefly to the question of how we practise self-repression. After all, it is not just in this Chamber – it also happens throughout the various sectors of society – that representatives of the Group of the European People’s Party discuss the allocation of quotas and, for some reason I cannot fathom, have a terrible dread of allocating quotas according to gender. It is said that women must be appointed on merit, but I should like to ask the question which, more often than not, employers and leading male politicians apparently fail to ask: What merits are we actually looking for? After all, we know that, to a large extent, women and men are at present unequally represented in society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have no problem whatsoever with backing Mrs Karamanou’s report one hundred per cent – on the contrary. We are waiting for what is called the ‘ketchup effect’. We have now been waiting for 150 years, so we do not want to wait even another two years for something to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Closed electoral lists drawn up directly by the parties – as recommended in your report – where it is not even possible to express a preference vote, represent the best system for achieving proportional representation of parties, or rather party officials and candidates selected by parties, be they women or men, in our parliaments. On the contrary, I think the slow progress in representation of women and young people in our parliaments is actually due to electoral systems which prevent candidates standing against each other and being chosen, if only in primary elections, by the people rather than by party secretaries.</p>
<p class="contents">I doubt if the statistics are particularly telling either way – I wonder what Margaret Thatcher or Hilary Clinton would think of your position on the majority system – but a great deal of data and evidence exists to demonstrate the opposite of your theses.</p>
<p class="contents">Another recommendation, made in the explanatory statement to your report, is to go so far as to grant public financing incentives to the parties which get the most women into parliament. Although done with the best of intentions, that could be the road to bureaucracy and subsidised representation and representativeness in our parliaments, and it is a road I do not feel we should take. Women’s representation requires more democracy, not less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By equal opportunities I do not mean levelling down, I mean equal opportunities for equally qualified women to join and progress in the decision-making process and in professional life, for example by eliminating differences in salaries between men and women doing equivalent work. We know from the statistics that in nearly all countries at least half the electorate is made up of women, yet the number of women in decision-making positions in companies and in public bodies is remarkably low. I regard the prime political task as being to eliminate all barriers to equal opportunities. I have in mind framework conditions that allow women to take responsibility for shaping their own individual lifestyle. A policy that shifts this task to economic players lets policy makers off the hook at the expense of those affected. Because the issues involved are social protection, the value of family work, qualifications and skills, working conditions, working hours and much more besides.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a matter of quotas and positive discrimination. If you will forgive me, I consider that notion in itself to be absurd. How can discrimination be positive? I do not want to have my job because I am a woman, but because I am qualified for it, and I believe that many women feel the same way.</p>

We always point out that we women make up half of the population and therefore we need greater participation so that women can feel duly represented.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important to point out that the incorporation of women into public life and the labour market in prominent positions is very recent. And we should also point out that it has happened thanks to the efforts of women themselves, who have had to overcome enormous difficulties. It is a long road along which we must continue to make progress, until such time as it is so normal to find women in the positions which have always been occupied by men that reports such as this are no longer necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Women need support, they need more training, more convenient hours of work and sufficient help so that they can reconcile their professional lives with their family lives. Greater participation by women means improvements in democracy and the full recognition of their rights on equal terms with men.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the majority of the report – and we would like to support it totally – with the exception of the specific reference to establishing fixed obligatory quotas, because that could create added problems for women themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We argue for more balanced and higher-level participation by women than there is at present, particularly in certain countries of the European Union. The European network of equality committees of the national parliaments, which already exists, should be strengthened, because it is a very appropriate forum for the exchange of experiences and of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Women must be involved in all areas – not just in the defence of their own rights – by participating in the resolution of everyday problems, in the institutions and on company management boards, in unions and in social and cultural organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the voices of women are absent when it comes to taking key decisions and setting priorities. In other words, women, who make up more than half of the world’s population, are seriously under-represented in political, economic and social areas. This is unacceptable in a democracy. Nowhere is the rift between <span class="italic">de jure</span> and <span class="italic">de facto</span> equality greater than within the decision-making process. In order to achieve a balance, a concrete plan of action with a set timetable is needed. An important part of such a plan is a benchmarking<span class="italic"> </span>system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Karamanou would like to see such a system. I propose that the EU’s objectives regarding women in the decision-making process be based on the average of the three most successful Member States within each field, with annual reports from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is mainly women who are victims of violations of human rights, such as rape, sexual offences, abuse in the home and trafficking. Women are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies that judge these crimes. This leads to the latter being given low priority. Often, the perpetrators are not prosecuted. The equal participation of women in decision-making processes is not only a matter of demanding social justice and democracy, but is also essential if women’s experience and knowledge is to be made the most of. Failure to utilise women’s decision-making abilities is an unacceptable waste.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party has opted for the allocation of quotas. This comes after many years’ struggle to increase the number of women involved in the party, which is to say <span class="italic">qualified </span>women<span class="italic">.</span> Women represent 50 per cent of our Government and 44 per cent of the Swedish Parliament. The only party to have openly opposed this is the Conservative Party. All these women, however, are qualified.

It should be obvious to everyone that men and women should have the same opportunities to participate in decision-making at all levels, but unfortunately this is not the case. So what can be done? We need greater equality in the home, access to good child care, shared parental responsibility, more encouragement within educational systems to break with traditional gender-linked roles, and flexible working hours in order to accommodate individual requirements. In addition to this, we also need working methods in politics, industry and trade unions which are not based on men’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that politics continues, to a far too great extent, to be a male domain – in some countries more than in others – the problems are greater still in industry and trade union organisations. This is unacceptable and needs to be the focus of more attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality is <span class="italic">not</span> a women’s issue and can only be achieved through cooperation between both sexes. Therefore, men must be involved – in a totally different way than at present – in working towards equality. For instance, more men should be actively involved in working towards equality within this Parliament. We <span class="italic">need</span> more women in decision-making positions, but – and this is where I agree with Mrs Theorin – <span class="italic">not </span>because they are women but because it is unacceptable for so much skill and experience to go to waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the figures consistently demonstrate this and we are making slow progress. That is why, in my view, we have to keep emphasising the issue of decision making and what Europe can do. Europe has played a leading role in the struggle for equality of treatment, on the one hand, and equality in decision making, on the other. This has been largely inadequate, however, bearing in mind the contents of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, where decision making on policy is taken into account only with regard to European Parliament or local elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to tell you about the French situation, where we have a law which is currently being implemented for local elections. In the battles we are waging we discover that every day in the French press there are truly fascinating articles and debates about the way that the real situation is being transformed, for, Mrs Karamanou, alongside Greece, France is the most backward country in Europe in this regard. Today, with the game of musical chairs that is being played by the government, women make up 8% of the national parliament. That is less than 10%, and that means that the French situation is significant. The debate we are having today in this Chamber is one that has been going on continuously for two or three years in France. I have just one argument in defence of equality, not just political equality but equality in general.</p>
<p class="contents">This argument, which is both political and philosophical, is this: there is no equality without restrictions, and I challenge the Group of the European People’s Party to prove otherwise. Let us not talk of positive discrimination quotas or anything else. There can be no production in our society without restrictions in order to ensure equality. This is the only comment I wanted to make. It was our final argument in the battle for equality.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I want to add very quickly, by way of conclusion, that there is nevertheless something important which must be clarified in today’s debate about decision making, which does not cover the whole problem regarding sexual equality, and that is the difference between political and economic matters. We now know what we have to do in the political arena, and I believe we are making progress. Certainly, I am gaining a great deal from the current experience in France. As regards economic equality in general, and decision making in particular, however, the problem is much more serious and much more extensive. As my fellow member in the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has just mentioned, what happens within trades unions and in professional elections has as yet hardly been formulated. We have to work on this. It is a much more complex issue. I believe that in future we must no longer talk about political equality without finding the appropriate mechanisms. These will not be the same mechanisms in terms of constraints as those used in the political arena. The means of guaranteeing better representation of women both in industry and at a professional level must be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the discussions in New York on how we could help women penetrate the world of decision making, the world of employment, etc., were wasted on her. She had reached her goal under her own steam, but she had made so many sacrifices along the way that she had become a woman whom I do not wish other women to take as a role model. For women who made their way into politics, diplomacy, etc. many years ago, are women who had to make huge sacrifices.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is to give women the opportunity to find their niche in decision making, politics and the world of employment in a normal way, with some help from society. We might well question how this should be done. How can we help women?</p>
<p class="contents">For years, we have been looking for strategies for a society which pays lip service to the idea that women must be given all opportunities, but which has so little input when it comes to setting up binding, effective strategies in order to achieve this. The few strategies which were set up have always been strategies with target figures or quotas – call them what you will. The target figure system or the quota system is not a system which only applies to women. In my country, where the two language regions, Dutch and French, should coexist in harmony, we also apply quotas for language proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">The quota system, therefore, is not a system specifically designed for women. People now act as if it were a system which only applies to women, but it is a system that is used in many areas of society. It is likely that it will also be applied to other areas in future. I have quoted one example. I cannot understand, therefore, those who are so anxious about this system.</p>
<p class="contents">Each time, I wonder whether the reason why they are against the quota system is because, ultimately, their aim is to prevent women from joining at all, or whether it is genuinely because they have fundamental objections. I am in favour of a quota system. This view is not shared by the majority of my group, but is by a number of others. I am an advocate of the system. I successfully introduced it in Belgium as the only country in Europe, and it was soon copied in France. I believe it is one of the few practical options which exist at the moment. I support the Karamanou report. Congratulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who trust in the idea that, thanks to official equality and the passage of time, self-regulatory mechanisms will work in favour of social balance, are mistaken, because they do not appreciate the fact that, although equality before the law and equality of opportunity are necessary conditions, they are not sufficient in themselves. Women with the necessary abilities often do not make it, but we know many cases of men who attain positions of power without having sufficient merit and they are never called ‘quota men’.</p>
<p class="contents">Parity democracy, which we have been talking about for many years, is an instrument which is intended, through balanced representation, to put an end to the model of structural power which has kept women out of the decision-making process. It is essential to create administrative structures which promote and monitor gender equality, and it would also be very helpful to resume the work of the European network of experts in the promotion of women in the field of decision-making, which had considerable success in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – as Mrs Karamanou’s excellent report points out – it is especially important to promote the participation of men and women in all policies at a proportion of a minimum of 40% and a maximum of 60%. In this respect, the systems of alternating men and women on party lists, promoted in certain political parties, have had unquestionable success. So the aim must be the adoption of national electoral regulations which provide for the creation of parity lists. The next Intergovernmental Conference must include amendments to the Treaty in this respect, so that this objective may be fulfilled in all the institutions and policies of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, fellow women MEPs, if we want to improve our democracy – and that should be our objective here – it is essential that we share responsibilities and power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality of the situation shows that, despite various recommendations and resolutions, this is an area in which major imbalances still remain, with a huge under-representation of women in decision-making bodies, both in economic and social spheres of activity and in politics, and this contributes to maintaining existing imbalances and discriminations.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on her work, emphasises, it is therefore crucial to adopt bold measures to promote the participation of women in decision-making, which will also require men and women to take on an equal share of responsibilities in public and private life. We must also encourage new anti-discriminatory practices, and that includes within political parties and public and private administrations too, with the aim of eliminating the psychological and practical obstacles to the participation of women in decision-making structures and in political life, thereby preventing retrograde action such as the recent case in Portugal, where the government abolished the Ministry for Equality. We must change this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, unlike our rapporteur, I am not conceited enough to claim that everything would be different and better if women participated equally in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must not accuse all men across the board of having the wrong intentions, for example in relation to defending the rights of children or to the environment, to name just a few of the areas mentioned in this context by our rapporteur. Fortunately, there are men who are talented and fervent supporters of the rights and interests that are close to our hearts. Unfortunately, there are also female politicians who just cannot be relied upon, even when it comes to putting more female candidates on the electoral lists. In my long political career I can tell you that it has mostly been women who, afraid of competition from me, have tried to put spokes in my wheels.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, of course, be said that, despite the good policies of equal treatment and equal opportunities which have been developed since 1975 by the Community and, above all, despite the well-intentioned recommendation of the Council in 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process, progress towards these objectives is slow. It is moving at a snail’s or a tortoise’s pace rather than at the speed of a racehorse. The reason why I voted against this draft resolution on the Commission report in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities was because it makes a number of exaggerated claims and demands, which are counter-productive for women who want to participate fully in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore against the reference to a 40% quota, below which measures would be called for to achieve a balanced representation of both genders. I am of the opinion that such measures are essential now and in the future, irrespective of the percentage of participation that is achieved. I am against the demand addressed to political parties that they adopt quota systems and, in particular, the zipper system to set up the electoral lists. This zipper system would be incompatible with the electoral law of my country where, fortunately for me, it is not the political party which decides the place of a candidate on the electoral list, but the people, by means of preference votes.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do is to call on political parties to reform their structures and procedures with a view to getting rid of the direct and indirect obstacles to the participation of women, given that Member States could encourage political parties to put a larger number of female candidates on their electoral lists, by means of financial incentives if necessary. Finally, I find it absurd to demand that only women be trained to take on leading roles and to take decisions when many men, who already have such roles and jobs, would greatly benefit from such training.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group has tabled amendments to get rid of the counter-productive demands I have just described and I hope that these amendments will be adopted. I would just like to make one more comment, which I should not really do before the vote, on the French translation of our amendments. It is defective to the extent that these amendments are not only incomprehensible but, as co-author, I am bound to say that, when I read these amendments in French, I feel like a mother hen who can no longer find her chicks. So, Mr President, it is the German text which takes precedence. I ask Members to be aware of this and to bear it in mind when we vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Amsterdam is ultimately the legal basis and it defines equal opportunities between men and women as one of the main priorities of European policy. However, although there has been some modest progress, there are still some conspicuous shortcomings. There is a marked imbalance in the involvement of men and women in the decision-making process, and there are alarming differences between individual Member States. Throughout Europe, there are especially few women in leading positions in administration and in political decision making. This means that everyone involved in the economic and social world has to play a part if responsibility is to be distributed evenly across the public and private sectors, in business, politics and family life. Above all, we need to recognise that the equal opportunities deficit in the labour market is partly attributable to the low proportion of women in Europe's businesses, in its trade unions and in its public sector, and partly attributable to an inadequate social infrastructure, distorted stereotypes and low pay.</p>
<p class="contents">One important area we need to tackle is education and training. Amongst other things, women have to learn to lay claim to a role in leadership and decision making. You cannot talk about balance when women account for just 40% of all those involved in politics at European or national level. Quotas are therefore an important instrument if we are to approach this target. But it is not just a question of increasing the number of women, but also about enhancing their role in society and recognising the quality of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Party and government structures need to be examined and where they are found to be lacking we need to jointly create binding requirements, such as ministries for equal opportunities. Greater involvement of women in public life needs to be regularly monitored using up-to-date statistics. This would also clearly demonstrate that not only have we reached targets but that we have also regressed in certain areas. This means that we have to promote equal opportunities while, at the same time, defending what has already been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Long before the ruling class gave women the right to vote, the workers’ movement had already, within its own organisation, given leading women the place they deserved. The fate of working women is linked to the status of the working class as a whole. It is women who are the main victims of insecure employment, enforced part-time work and the low salaries that are paid for such work. What is unacceptable is that insecure employment, enforced part-time work and low salaries are allowed to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Speeches about equality between men and women will continue to be just so much hot air as long as countless working families are deprived of adequate housing and as long as there are not enough public amenities, child care centres and nursery schools.</p>

That much we all agree upon. But we also know very well that participation in decision making, be it by men or women, is not an automatic right. The situation varies widely, depending on the field, the specialism and the area of responsibility. This is bound to be a factor when reaching a decision about any man or woman seeking to hold a particular office, applying for a job or wishing to join a particular committee.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can legitimately ask if this always applies. Is it not true to say that there are still certain prejudices in our society which militate against a person or a sex from the outset? The male nursery school teacher or woman fire-fighter are still exceptions to the rule – as are women who make it to the very top on management boards, as directors or on political committees. As a rule, this under-representation is not because of any lack of skill or expertise. A woman always has to do something extra to prove herself – expertise on its own is not enough, her entire circumstances play a part. Her children, her family and even the simple idea of the weaker sex are barriers to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">For far too long we have been telling women that they have to be better than the men they are competing against. For that reason alone we need things like the report before us to wake society up from time to time and keep up the momentum. I believe that the double burden of family duties and a career should not be used as grounds for discrimination, nor are they a double disadvantage as stated in Recital D. Combining a family and a career in fact demonstrates a high degree of organisational skill and life experience that should not be underestimated, and should be regarded as a particularly useful skill for those in leading positions. It should also be assumed that men have the same family commitments as women, and all we women debating here this morning who have a family would be unable to do all this if our partners were not also committed to their families as fathers.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we have not quite reached that point yet, and it can still be said that whereas a family provides support for a man, it is a millstone for a woman. So, right from the outset, when we are educating young people, we need to counteract these entrenched social images. I doubt whether simply demanding quotas and percentages is the right way to achieve greater representation, and it should surely not be this Parliament’s job to call for 40% representation in all political fields at national and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">For awareness to grow we need balanced reports and discussion papers that emphasise equal representation, and I therefore urge you to support the PPE Group’s amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not offering my congratulations as a mere formality. I am doing so in order to be fair and because I believe they are deserved. This report is not only excellent, but its explanatory statement is a study of the greatest interest to anyone concerned about equal rights for men and women and will undoubtedly serve as a seminal reference work for the future. This proves the eccentricity of the Bureau's decision to reduce the length of explanatory statements to one page. This Chamber does not produce paper by the metre. We are engaged in politics and politics must have a sound basis. Your report, Mrs Karamanou, is a fine example of the importance of the political texts drawn up in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In my speech I shall focus on the electoral system. This is a crucial problem because it predates our own participation in politics. Women must be given the opportunity to be elected in order to prove what they are capable of. Some electoral systems make the participation of women even more difficult. These are, as we have seen, systems that use single name lists. This practice has systematically penalised women. It is not so much the electorate that is to blame, but the structures of the parties themselves, which create enormous difficulties by means which are often less than legal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, although there is a move towards attempting to change this system of single name electoral lists, with procedures being created, in France for example, to set the balance right and to achieve a quota of 50% for both sexes, the Portuguese government has announced the creation of a new electoral law that will partially replace the proportional system with the single name system. This is an initiative that gives great cause for concern and we must be aware that, in this case, this will clearly discriminate against women who wish to participate actively in politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that the spokesman for the PPE who expressed the greatest opposition to the report has left because the debate would have been highly interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to start by making a political observation. The title of the report: “The balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process” has a dual meaning. The decision-making process takes place in the centres of power; but it also means balanced participation in the most important decision-making process for the future, which takes place in the family. So it refers to both sexes and the numbers of women in decision-making centres cannot be increased unless the proportion of time which men spend on family matters is also increased. This automatically means that if we want to achieve the required target, we need to make changes to the family, society, the economy and the cultural identity which we have had for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate revolved largely around whether or not quotas, i.e. a quantitative commitment on participation, was an acceptable solution. I would say, from a philosophical point of view, that a set of numbers or rules can never change a social fact of life. However, history shows that rules and targets can bring about change, especially if they are accompanied by a set of policies. So what we need to do, and this is clearly expressed in Mrs Karamanou's report, is to implement three types of policy simultaneously if we are to achieve this important objective, which concerns democracy in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The first type of policy is mainstreaming equal opportunities in the economy and employment, in social systems and social protection and in education systems and the cultural identity of our societies. The second type of policy concerns specific measures and specific positive action to support the policy of participation in the decision-making process. These measures relate to electoral systems, where it has been proven that there is a close correlation between electoral systems and the participation of women, they relate to the need for continuous statistics which throw the facts into relief, they relate, of course to political parties and their internal political commitments and they relate to laws for positive action. Excellent examples have been cited in this Chamber, which prove that wherever quotas have been applied in conjunction with all the policies which I have just mentioned, they have had positive results. And we cannot ignore the fact that the only countries which have made any serious headway with the participation of women are the countries which had applied specific policies. Not always with legislative undertakings on quotas but with political undertakings by the political parties and always with specific quantitative targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a third type of policy which relates to intervention by the European Union and collaboration on the part of the Member States, such as political networks of women, indicators at European level – I refer to the Finnish Presidency and the 9 indicators, the application of which could create national undertakings and national targets – benchmarking, training and, finally, support for women in the national states and on the European political scene with an important international role, because this is what creates the standards for power and the standards for women politicians for later generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall close by repeating what the Prime Minister of Luxembourg said when the question of whether or not there should be specific targets for employment in the Member States was being debated: ‘The expression of political desire, the expression of political intention is not enough. Policy without specific quantitative targets and means is simply literature.’</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
