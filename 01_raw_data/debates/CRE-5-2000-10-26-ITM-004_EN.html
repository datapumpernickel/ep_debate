<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Montfort (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all carry our own list of recurrent disappointments we can do nothing about in our heads, but it is a good thing to have a moan about them from time to time just to show that we do not accept the situation and that impotence does not always rhyme with indifference, not yet anyway. Listening to what some Members had to say in committee, Members who have been in this House longer than I have, gave me the feeling that this multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship exercise that Parliament is going through for the fourth time belongs in that category. In substance, people were telling me that good intentions are always welcome but we need to make sure, contrary to what has always happened so far, that the next report on the subject does not have to make the same assessment as the previous one, because nothing has really changed in the position of European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">So the aim of the text before you today is to transform a pointless compulsory figures test into a promising examination of a freestyle programme where the European Union can add value as long as it understands its place and its role in the arrangement. The time when the defence of business, especially small and medium-sized business, was like a corporatist battle is long gone, not just because there is only a handful of diehards left who see the world of business through the distorting prism of the class struggle, but above all because, at the start of this third millennium, everyone knows that the issues of employment and social cohesion are crucial for our societies, and business has a pre-eminent role in those issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is well to bear in mind that, at both the economic and the social level, business leads. The major job-creator and driving force for social integration, it has also progressively acquired paramount importance as regards training for young people and continuous training, and as it has in the area of land development where it is, in the end, the most efficient instrument. Recognising this, the Fifteen adopted the Charter for Small Enterprises last June at the Feira Summit. Its existence is already affording us a glimpse of the considerable progress that can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides undeniably constituting the basis on which we must construct a policy on business which genuinely serves business, the Charter has the great merit not just of limiting our action to small businesses, but of making them the central point in our thinking, our priority unit of reference. Parliament, composed of elected representatives who regularly rub shoulders with representatives of small business, is duty bound to present this option clearly, turning it into an objective reality and introducing the only method that can properly embrace the diversity of the world of business.</p>
<p class="contents">The SME is not a multinational in miniature, any more than it suffices to extrapolate the difficulties of a small business quantitatively to get a proper grasp of the problems of large units. It does seem sound policy to favour a pragmatic and hands-on approach, putting the small business at the heart of the system, rather than a proposal merely producing balanced statistics that are quite impossible to use in practice, on the pretext of avoiding a scattershot approach.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am glad the Committee on Industry unanimously decided to prioritise a sectoral approach to business, the inevitable choice for identifying as precisely as possible the real and specific needs of businesses whose disparity lends itself poorly to a horizontal approach. That would not be effective. Certainly, comparing performance and exchanging best practice are most interesting ideas in absolute terms, but positive intervention in the day-to-day lives of businesses cannot be achieved by that means alone.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should be done? We need to start with three simple ideas: first, instead of accepting that we more or less give up trying to reach as many companies as possible directly, we should use the existing networks whose understanding of real-life situations makes them indispensable partners in the drafting, but also in the efficient implementation of a policy geared to businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the report stresses the need for close links between consulting circles and organisations representing businesses, which have much to teach us and can prevent us from turning a good idea into a bad decision out of ignorance. Next, we should take care not to make access to capital for firms, especially the smallest ones, even more complicated. Here we are touching on a key factor in the start-up, development, recovery, transfer, even survival of businesses, and a certain number of decisions that have been taken, or are on the point of being taken, are causing concern. These range from the obscure reshaping of the respective tasks of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, to the draft Directive on banks' own resources, which we have still to be persuaded will have an impact on the ability of a business to obtain a loan.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the case, with the advent of an economy based more than ever on knowledge and technological innovation, the Commission absolutely must ensure that the boldest, most innovative, risk-taking companies are helped to grasp the opportunities on offer and reap the rewards of their enterprising spirit. Finally, since the spirit of enterprise is inseparable from the notion of responsibility, we should establish clearly what Europe can contribute as added value in terms of business policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The political orientation is the responsibility of the Member States. The Council set that orientation at Feira, with the Charter for Small Enterprises. By concentrating on coordinating the policies defined in this context and applied by the Member States, and in particular by a commitment to lowering all the technical and administrative barriers that place needless strain on business progress, that approach would find consummate expression. I hope the vote in this House will replicate the unanimity shown in the Committee on Industry. That would send out the strong and clear signal the business world needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you in advance for supporting my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I know I can count on your energy and determination to implement this programme. It needs to be linked to other Community programmes and an annual balance sheet should be drawn up so that adjustments can be made if necessary. In that way we can meet the two challenges of full employment and social cohesion together. Thank you on behalf of all enterprises, but also on behalf of our societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Montfort on her report and also thank her for the very good cooperation which we have enjoyed. It really has been fun. Where the economy is concerned, Europe's aim is of course to become the number one in the world and the multiannual programme can make a contribution to achieving this. However, what is particularly important in this sector is that we promote a spirit of enterprise in society and that young people give more serious consideration to starting their own business or to going into smaller companies. To do this we need to be active in the context of education in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Until recently, after completing their studies and training, many young people made a choice between going into the civil service or simply into larger companies which are similar to the state. Here we need to bring about a sea of change. But we also sense that this is already happening - many young people are in fact also founding new start-up companies, and we should encourage this entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">But I have three specific comments on this programme. Firstly, the Commission is saying that in the future it will promote and define policies which are enterprise-friendly. To this end it wishes to introduce a benchmarking exercise, which is certainly an interesting initiative. We must, however, ensure that it is effective. At present the plan is that this exercise will be run by the EU and the Member States, which will certainly not give an accurate picture. If I take my native country, Germany, then one single set of statistics for Germany does not reflect the situation in the regions. There are huge variations between, say, Bavaria and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Or take Greater London and Scotland. Greater differentiation ought to be possible here; the regions need to be involved if we are to get an accurate picture of the impact of enterprise-friendly policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is considering taking more of a back-seat role in supporting SMEs. This is certainly also a debatable step. The success of assistance to small and medium-sized businesses should actually be measured on how effective it is, and that is why the question certainly does arise as to what extent it is possible to provide this assistance in this form at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">But if assistance is withdrawn at European level then the regions need once again to be given increased opportunities to act. In this context the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rule should, in any case, be re-examined and the group exemption regulation for SMEs should be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns traditional companies and <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce. We always draw a distinction between the new economy and the old economy. Where I live in Bavaria there is one business, a carpenter, who now derives 70% of his turnover from the Internet. Is that the old or the new economy? I think that we should merge these two sectors to make the normal, traditional sector of the economy also part of the new economy. I have two requests of the Commissioner here: the first is for the Commission to support the development of software intended specifically for SMEs, which in terms of size and cost would be suitable for use by the SME sector. The second is for DG Enterprise, which was formed by merging the industry and SMEs portfolios, to champion SME-related issues with more vigour and to assume a watchdog function in the whole Commission for SME matters; it should scrutinise all the Commission's legislative acts and communications for their effect on SME-related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also hope that the assistance programmes which the Commission offers to SMEs in the future are presented in such a way that they are considered from the customer's point of view, so that SMEs can always understand their purpose.</p>

<p class="contents">It has to be said that on the basis of European Union criteria, over 99% of companies could be defined as SMEs, which is not very sensible. That very fact illustrates the European vagueness of the concept and explains many uncertainties. Bear in mind that the first Community action programme in this area was adopted in 1983, seventeen years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mrs Montfort, has done excellent work over the last few weeks, in-depth work in close collaboration with all her colleagues. She has identified the points where there was a lack of clarity or significant slippage between statements and reality in the Commission’s text. Her work, in which we have assisted, has consisted of pinpointing issues and trying to establish a more precise classification of the different types of SME, micro-enterprises and craft businesses. And, along those lines, we too have tabled and pressed for a series of strong, concrete proposals for moving from words to deeds, in relation to SMEs, by giving them access to innovation and electronic commerce, simplifying certain customs formalities for them, ending certain disparities in administration and regulations, developing – and this is important – access to risk capital, developing the Euro Info Centres to broaden the scope of business information and support, and making the framework programme for research and technological development more open to innovative SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I and my friends are concerned, we have sought to put the accent on crafts and micro-enterprises. I have asked for environmental and sustainable development targets to be properly taken into consideration, and for access of SMEs to new communications and information technologies to be promoted. I have also asked that actions geared to specific groups like women, young people and the social economy sectors be encouraged, not forgetting employee participation in the life of these SMEs in general.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs are the major source of job creation, in terms of both quality and quantity, and they play a crucial role in social cohesion and regional planning. That is why it is very urgent to remove the many obstacles to their development and organise the necessary training.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mrs Montfort, I hope a massive vote for your report will finally allow us to make a qualitative leap forward in this area, and also that certain excessively liberal amendments will be rejected, for instance, on reducing the number of promotional programmes and on creating a new monitoring centre.</p>
<p class="contents">If I had to sum it up in a nutshell, Mr President, I would say that what we need here– and if I say so myself – is less ideology and more action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This care is more than needed if we want to establish 'Enterprise Europe’ by 2005 and if we want to make the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world. The amendment to the report in the Committee, partly tabled at my proposal, emphasised that the multiannual programme must be used as an instrument to promote economic growth, full employment and social cohesion. I would like to stress that this is an important focus, which must be brought more to the fore in the information and information campaigns, because it cannot be emphasised enough that entrepreneurship and an entrepreneurial climate are both of key significance, and that this is the reason why particular attention must be paid to the education and training of young people, as well as to providing permanent training to staff of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would particularly like to make a case for systematically eliminating as many as possible, if not all, barriers which stand in the way of establishing the internal market, and for optimising the competitiveness of SMEs, allowing them to develop in a dynamic and sustained manner. In addition, I have always been an advocate of underpinning these goals with efficient and pragmatic policy. I am delighted with Mr Caudron’s final remark which amounts to investing less in ideology, but more in efficient and pragmatic policy, which means that red tape should be kept to an absolute minimum. In our Union, this should in the first instance translate into simplification of customs formalities, because the fiscal, social, administrative and regulatory disparities between the Member States in terms of costs constitute a substantial barrier to equal access to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also urge you to take into consideration the enlargement of the European Union which is upon us. The effective implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> is necessary to ensure that enlargement becomes a win-win situation for the Member States and candidate countries alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has studied the proposals with great care, and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned. That approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I want to stress some of the strengths we need to build on to improve Europe's contribution to business in the new ‘knowledge-based’ economy. How can we make a better contribution to Enterprise Europe, as President Prodi called it in a recent speech?</p>
<p class="contents">First, every business must be included. Of course there are large businesses, involving several thousand people, say. We need to recognise not just what they contribute to the market economy, in terms of jobs and profit, but also their contribution to knowledge through their support for applied research and to the creation of hosts of businesses around them. Through their contacts with – often public – research laboratories they undoubtedly supplement public funding, which frequently needs supplementing, and enables discoveries to be made. So it is important to make sure our action here is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to SMIs/SMEs and micro-enterprises. As Mr Caudron said, these represent 98% of our economic fabric. Our greatest potential for adaptation resides in them. They are the true economic and innovation vanguard, in the front line and openly exposed to the risks inherent in this domain. We should take special care of them and make sure there are concrete measures which they can assimilate easily.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and without going through the measures set out in the report, which are, anyway, the result of an assessment made last year, you will note, all the same, that we are taking up the same old essential points: simplification of the assistance formalities, which are still too cumbersome, and even stifling for SMIs; help with finance and risk capital to ensure greater stability; aid for research into new technologies; establishment of a European standard through the BEST process; aid with communication and information. These businesses need buttressing within their geographic or technological environment. We must encourage them, promote local development using local resources, both material and human, and foster their relations with local communities. Here we should not only be helping businesses with a traditional structure, but also public-private partnerships and cooperatives which are increasingly contributing, among other things, to improving stability and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look for European added value. This could involve, in particular, the installation of a European network, both physical and electronic, which every SMI can join, where they can find information, exchange knowledge through appropriate mechanisms with appropriate ethics, and benefit from the prime advantages the European Union decides to establish for their support.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear to me that Brussels cannot run everything in this domain. We need operations in the field, regional delegations the Commission, Parliament or the Council can control, as the Majo report recognised just recently. Certain intervention issues must also be selected. They are easy to find: in the information society especially, in that sustainable development we hear so much about, in the fields of the environment, clean technologies, eco-technologies, new energy sources and new materials. The hallmark of this European aid network should be a number of centres, like the Euro Info Centres.</p>
<p class="contents">For an SME/SMI, working with this European network would undoubtedly mean that, where synergies exists, it would not have to form a consortium with several other businesses in different Union countries, which often results in an artificial set-up with masses of paperwork and endless complications. I really hope the Commission will set up a working group on this topic, involving interested Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there are the proposals for the European research area we are beginning to construct. In parallel, we propose to introduce a European innovation area, and I am grateful to Mrs Montfort for having agreed to include that proposal in her report. We must take account of the results of and follow-up to the work of the Science and Governance Conference held last week in Brussels under the auspices of the Seville Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, because there is plenty of overlap with the subject we are dealing with today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am sure it is time to create a proper parliamentary office for scientific and technological options assessment within the European Parliament, to assist in decisions and monitoring. These exist in the national parliaments and ours would match theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our President, Mrs Fontaine, is asking us, because we are responsible for STOA, to send a message of support today to the EPTA, an organisation specialised in technological assessment in Europe, founded under the aegis of our colleague Mr Barón Crespo, which is meeting in Berlin on 10 November. But STOA is not really that kind of organisation and we have specific proposals to make on the subject. Mrs Montfort, our group will give your report its wholesale support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They only have full order books if they have clients, and these can, roughly speaking, be divided into three categories: firstly, large companies; secondly, private consumers and thirdly, the public sector. It follows from this that small and medium-sized businesses only thrive if unemployment is low and if public budgets at all levels are free of debt and have sufficient resources to commit to the investment budget. Within small and medium-sized businesses I should like to pay particular attention to the very small and micro-enterprises, because, of course, here additional specific difficulties compound the situation, in particular in manufacturing. These companies very rarely have their own research and development capabilities and the danger is therefore particularly great that they will be cut off from the development of new products and the further development of existing ones, that they will use antiquated technologies and that they will not adapt to the demand for increasing quality.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, very often – because the managerial staff are not adequately qualified – the opportunities for support, which are readily available here, are not exploited to the full. All of this is quite apart from the main problems which to this day have not been resolved: permanent undercapitalisation; very poor access to credit because they cannot provide the guarantees required in normal banking practice; markets limited to their respective regions and cash loss. This means that a policy focused on small and medium-sized businesses is needed, on the one hand to standardise the assistance programmes and on the other, obviously, to take account also of the specific interests and problems linked to company size, company structures, production lines and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Montfort's report constitutes a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal. People might almost think, Mrs Montfort, that you yourself were a committed SME entrepreneur. Your report is excellent. Nevertheless, I would have liked even more attention to have been paid to at least two economic trends. The first is a greater emphasis on – I do not say a change towards but a greater emphasis on – demand-driven economic policy compared with supply-side economic policy. Secondly, there has also been a power shift within investment policy towards investment for expansion and – to a lesser extent – towards investment in rationalisation. Looked at another way, this means that the taxpayer makes tax receipts available which companies use to rationalise. Then they put the people who used to work there out onto the street and say to the taxpayer, now it is up to you again to sort out what happens to these workers who have been shown the door. Surely this cannot be what economists want. It may seem perfectly acceptable from a business management point of view because of the profits that it can be expected to generate, but not from the point of view of the overall economy. I think that we in the European Parliament have a responsibility to the overall economy which takes precedence over our responsibility to the business economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, the principle of subsidiarity is afforded the attention it deserves in our view. We endorse the attention which the rapporteur, Mrs Montfort, is paying – rightly so – to small and medium-sized businesses, and micro-enterprises, as well as to granting priority support to young fledgling entrepreneurs. The rapporteur has listed a number of key points in a bid to strengthen the European entrepreneurial climate. For example, she calls for enterprises to have access to new information and communication technology. The question does, however, arise as to how the Multiannual programme can help enterprises strengthen their competitiveness in specific terms. Whichever way, the Commission has a stimulating role to play in exchanging regional experience and best practices in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of Mrs Montfort’s key points is the improvement, or rather simplification, of legislation and the regulatory structure in the Member States. We have always been in favour of eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles for industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, a third point of concern is the protection of intellectual property rights at European level. We especially have the patenting of software innovation in mind. Enterprises need clarity. In other words: is there still any purpose in investing in this sector? In this context, the question also arises as to whether Europe is possibly lagging behind the US precisely because of the lack of a European patent on software.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, practice at national and regional level will determine the success of the present multiannual programme. This is the level at which, according to our political vision, entrepreneurial initiatives should be taken. European backing for such entrepreneurial spirit is always welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am familiar with the problems experienced by a small business. That is why I should like to congratulate Mr Liikanen, because, today, something has been achieved which is particularly important for small businesses and for our many sole traders.</p>
<p class="contents">Unbundling of the local loop will open up new opportunities for competition and will therefore offer new businesses the possibility of making favourable acquisitions and give them good opportunities to prove themselves in this field. You will see that the programme has been allocated around EUR 230 million; if you divide that by the 16 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European Union the result is EUR 3 per company per year. The programme is so important precisely because it generates momentum, the right kind of momentum, which is also very important for us as Members. Take the example of the Euro Info Centres. My contact there is Magister Leitner, and if I come across a problem related to support programmes or a problem with the European institutions, then I can tell my employers that there is someone there who is competent and in the know, someone who can give information in the shortest possible time about public calls for tender, support programmes or research on infrastructure. This is excellent for Europe because help can be given quickly and competently in the form of technically correct information.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important, particularly for small companies, for help to be given quickly. For small companies, the three or six months which they have to wait for a piece of information to be forthcoming or for a programme to start is an endlessly long time. This means that the smaller the company, the more rapidly everything happens, and with new technologies everything is of course happening even more quickly. We all know that the pace at which we live our lives has become faster because we use mobile telephones, e-mail and the Internet, and this opens up entirely new possibilities. That is why it is important where financing is concerned for us also to ensure that companies have access to the capital market, not only to the stock market. Above all, when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it should not need to provide 120% loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea. Unfortunately, we are still a long way from this way of thinking in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What we still need are more experts to guide our companies through complex procedures at European level. I should like, by way of an example, simply to mention standards. In principle a small company does not know very much about how a standard comes into being and how a standard is established at European level. That is why associations such as NORMAPME are very important, because this is another place where a small business can seek know-how quickly and efficiently, because tenders relating to this may be on the Internet and because, quite simply, this is helpful for its everyday work.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important points is of course tax rates. America has an average tax rate of 30% while we have one of 45%, which means quite simply that small businesses here have to be 15% more productive or work for 15% longer for the same reward. That is why we should make it our business to bring down tax rates as far as possible by introducing less hefty laws, slimmed-down benchmarking and best practices so as to create a simple and well-ordered environment for our businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the debate conducted within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to which I hope Parliament will give tangible substance when it comes to vote, has been all the more valid and necessary in terms of reintroducing into this multiannual programme, which we are going to approve, suitable time and space for small and medium-sized businesses and, in particular, for micro-enterprises and craft industries which are of such great importance to the economy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">From this viewpoint, I feel that we cannot approve of the fact that the programme presented by the Commission devotes little time or space to micro-enterprises, in particular, when in recent years the concept of micro-enterprises and craft industries has been gathering considerable momentum. In fact, we must do more and better for small businesses and micro-enterprises, and above all, we must do this in concrete terms when talking of the information and knowledge economy, research and innovation. When seen in this context, this multiannual programme can only represent a first step, after which we must continue in tangible terms – and I agree with what Mr Rübig has just said on this – by promoting, for example, the development of the Euro Info Centre<span class="italic"> </span>network, which is one of the facets and mainstays of action in favour of small and medium-sized businesses within the European Union. I feel that this network should also be made responsible for the local-level coordination of those European networks that are already up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must in practice set aside specific and ring-fenced amounts, under European Union actions, for small and medium-sized businesses, within the ambit of all those activities relating to research, innovation, the e-Europe project and so forth.</p>

<p class="contents">The explanatory statement emphasises that the term SME can equally relate to a business employing up to 500 employees and to a craft business employing only two or three people and that, taken all together, these represent 99% of the Union’s businesses. But how many SMEs are actually subsidiaries of large industrial groups? And how are the subsidies distributed between them and the craft businesses?</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not breathe a word about that, because it would mean admitting that all the talk about small businesses is just a popularity-seeking justification for granting aid to big business. The national governments, and even the regional and local authorities, already act as gigantic finance pumps to siphon off taxpayers’ money, that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population including the most disadvantaged, and pour this into big business and thence to proprietors and shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">All the European Institutions think about is boosting these appallingly unfair transfers when, even in the rich part of the continent of Europe represented by the Union, there are millions of people living in poverty. And if I may, Mr President, I would like to respond to something Mrs Montfort said.

I am the absentee boss of a very small enterprise, our family business in London. I will not say what it does, that might constitute an advertisement, but it was founded by my father, Francis Chichester, and I am very proud of it. It also enables me to come here and do my work for my constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to welcome any measures, like this proposal and this report, that indicate our support at European level for the importance of SMEs and small businesses in particular. I would like to congratulate Mrs Montfort on all her hard work in her report which, as we have heard, commands wide support across the House.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the best thing for small businesses is for the authorities to leave them alone and to desist from the temptation of trying to pick winners. Diversity, safety in numbers, from which the winners will emerge, is the best way forward. I am reminded of what the Commissioner said to us a year ago about the experience in the United States, where they are not afraid of failure and they believe in the old Scottish proverb of "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again". The importance is to strike the right balance, to avoid having a continual situation of people failing at the expense of other people.</p>
<p class="contents">I suspect that the real obstacles and hurdles that small businesses face are in other areas of European and national legislation, where they face great burdens in terms of administration, taxation and regulation. That seems very onerous indeed for small businesses, disproportionately so. I recently looked at the forms required for filling in tax returns for small businesses in the UK and the detail required great concentration on getting the right answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying that in my view the most important thing for small businesses, the best medicine for them, is competition. That is the way they achieve efficiency, innovation and profitability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of its financial limitations, I think the multiannual programme merely acknowledges the problem and gives a positive political bearing and encouragement, but is not in a position to give any substantial help or, more importantly, to reverse the prevalent trends in the present economy, which are literally crushing small enterprises in every sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is generally accepted that small and medium-sized businesses are a fount of new talent and innovative ideas, trial goods and services and a spirit of independent creation. But how many of them are able to convert what are precious elements not only for the economy and society, but also for European civilisation, into real entrepreneurial development? Very few.</p>
<p class="contents">The nursery for small and medium-sized businesses contains several thousand experiments which feed large enterprises with manpower and ideas. They face tremendous competition and even if they succeed at production level, often presenting new, unprecedented and imaginative proposals, what can they do when it comes to distribution networks, marketing and advertising their products? Distribution is highly complicated and costly nowadays, it needs large quantities of products and good organisation and it often exceeds the potential of small and medium-sized businesses. As far as advertising is concerned, it is generally prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The takeovers which we have seen grow to mammoth proportions over recent years are literally annihilating these endeavours, stopping them in their creative tracks and robbing the environment of the competitiveness of creativity, in a bid to ensure that the market is left with conventional, stereotypical products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I wonder how much longer we will have to wait until the European Union is empowered to amend the regulations that govern small and medium-sized businesses throughout Europe and above all, when we will see a change in a climate which in 45 years of left-wing or predominantly left-wing government has dampened the entrepreneurial spirit of European companies. In many of the Member States, people who set up their own businesses, rather than being viewed as having created at least one job – their own – are sometimes held to be delinquents, profiteers, thieves or tax evaders.</p>
<p class="contents">New companies should be granted exemptions from taxes and charges for a period of at least five years, and we should provide for support to be given to young people setting up in business by an older person who can contribute their experience. Concerning the aspect with which I am most familiar – that of pensions and social welfare – entrepreneurs working on their own account should receive as much as people employed by others. In many of the 15 Member States, persons working on their own account have lower pensions, lower levels of mutual assistance and less industrial injury insurance. This is unjust and I therefore support this report.</p>

I am a constructive critic of some of Mr Liikanen's efforts – I think the first document that we saw was not really as focused as it should have been. Mrs Montfort has brought some valuable focus on the key issues facing small and medium-sized businesses. I particularly want to mention the innovation in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which held a hearing on the issues raised in Mrs Montfort's report. The more we get people from small and medium-sized businesses across Parliament's threshold talking to us about issues, the better we shall be able to do our job. This is something that the Committee on Industry needs to do on a regular basis from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">In my closing remarks in this debate I should like to come back to this question of focus. The problem in small and medium-sized businesses is that they do not have a lot of resources to go out and get information, to find out what grants and help are available, to do the sort of administrative tasks that are increasingly being imposed upon them by national governments. What we need to consider is the way we make information available to them. What I want the Commissioner to address above all in the range of measures that we have proposed here is making access to support and information easy and quick so that people running these businesses will be able to use the information effectively. We know that there is a lot of help available across the European Union. People are always talking about helping SMEs, as Mr Caudron who is a veteran of this process has reminded us, but we know there are many businesses not taking advantage of the help available. A focused, effective, directed and simple set of measures is what we need if this programme is really going to have the effect that it should have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you too for supporting the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship will constitute a major instrument in support of European businesses. It is primarily geared to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is small businesses that suffer most from obstacles to enterprise. The red tape of restrictions and regulations hits them full force. That is why we should ‘think small first’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the guiding principle of the Charter for Small Enterprises. We welcome the principle of amendment with reference to the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Many amendments refer to micro-enterprises-enterprises and crafts. We welcome the support given to them. Account should be taken of that in implementing the programme but there are no grounds for mentioning them separately in the legislative text.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Summit on entrepreneurship and transition to an information society for all, we need dynamic and competitive businesses. They are the only ones that can provide more jobs and better jobs. We can only end social exclusion if we have competitive businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We need entrepreneurs from all sectors of society. More women entrepreneurs, more young entrepreneurs and more entrepreneurs from society strata which do not have the representation they deserve. They will all have a place of honour in the multiannual programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Growing businesses need the type of financing appropriate to each stage of their life cycle. There are gaps in the market which need to be filled, especially at the start-up stage. Enlargement and sustainability need to be priorities in all our work. The Members of this Parliament have subscribed to those principles. We are likewise convinced of their importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hoping for a limited number of effective projects, which is much better than spreading them too thinly. I am grateful for your support for this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to our BEST process, the Commission will identify and implement best practice. We will publicise the results widely and keep Parliament informed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to give careful thought to the level of European governance best adapted to the various initiatives. We have no intention of imposing ourselves on activities which would benefit by being conducted at national level. But we will welcome – because we will need it – the participation of the Member States in terms of providing support and information to business on how to access the European market. The programme will ensure that the networks provide this information.</p>
<p class="contents">We need advice from the business world and other interest groups in all our efforts. We are currently improving our advice structure so as to be able to remain in constant contact with these contributors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, European businesses need a good business environment if they are to develop. The multiannual programme will be committed to improving the <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> of small and medium-sized businesses. Thank you for supporting us in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the idea that we should review the implementation of the programme annually. I have a completely open mind as to the form of that review. We must think about that together.</p>
