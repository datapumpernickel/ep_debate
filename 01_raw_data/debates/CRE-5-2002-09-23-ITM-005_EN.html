<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert J.E. (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, as you said, this report – on an 'open-coordination-method' common asylum policy and internal security – covers two methods. It is really two reports in one. It should have been two separate reports but owing to Parliament's Rules, and also to time restraints and organisational factors, it is a single report.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole approach of the common asylum policy is integral to the work of our committee and we are very much committed to it. Regarding the open coordination method, we stress that this must not be a substitute for Parliament's involvement in the whole process of working towards a common asylum policy and indeed a common immigration policy: we are committed to the full communitarisation of these topics. It is very important that Parliament has a full role in the legislative process in this area. We welcome the open coordination method. The sharing of statistics and everything else it involves must not be seen as a substitute for moving towards the full communitarisation of a common asylum policy with full involvement for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that using the open coordination method does not reduce asylum policy to the lowest common denominator of Member States' current policies. We want high standards. We want best practice to be followed. Accordingly, the open coordination method must be used as a transition period towards a second stage where asylum is a full legislative agenda item.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, best practice in the open coordination method should not be seen as a substitute for the Geneva Convention and the relevant Protocol thereto. We must put pressure on all Member State governments to integrate asylum policy, and indeed immigration considerations, into all policy areas as a horizontal policy objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the communication is on internal security. This has clearly been moved up the agenda since the events of 11 September last year. We must ensure that Member States' provisions already existing under the Geneva Convention exclude persons who have been involved in terrorist activities, crimes against humanity or other similar offences which are already clearly defined. We must make certain that these provisions are presented in such a way as to ensure that terrorists do not enter EU territory via the asylum procedure. There is no evidence at the moment that would-be terrorists are entering the European Union or any Member States and seeking asylum, but the report seeks to make absolutely clear that there are safeguards and procedures to cover that eventuality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the measures that are introduced to deal with the threat to internal security are proportionate, that they are effective and above all that they safeguard human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission's commitment to using only the Geneva Convention exclusion clauses as a basis for rejecting individuals' claims for asylum, but I urge the exclusion clauses to be used carefully. I reiterate that the EU must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incurring the death penalty. We need to be absolutely clear on the status and treatment of people who are excluded from international procedure, but who are non-removable from EU territory owing to any of the different reasons which may lead to this status.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, with certain reservations that I have outlined, we welcome the Commission's commitment in this report to ensuring that access to asylum procedure is guaranteed. I ask that the exclusion clauses should not be routinely considered for practical as well as humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled some amendments to this report either to correct minor errors or owing to setbacks in committee, but these do not detract from the importance and significance of the report. I commend the work that Commissioner Vitorino has been doing in moving towards a common European policy on asylum. There is no way forward other than for all 15 Member States to have a similar policy with guidelines that are not just similar but the same, and which are recognised and enforced by all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Seville European Council marked a major commitment in the field of asylum. It set the end of 2003 as the deadline for the adoption of all the legislative instruments of the first generation of acts concerning European asylum policy. In my view, this commitment by the Heads of State or Government is important for gauging the credibility of European policy in a field as sensitive as asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not hide the fact from Parliament – and never have done – that negotiations are currently giving some cause for concern. To be precise, I do not believe that the solution lies in a form of harmonisation that is tied to the lowest common denominator. This is clearly not where the added value of a European asylum policy lies. In parallel with<span class="bold"> </span>these negotiations, however, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Ruud Lubbers, attended the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Copenhagen last week, and alerted us to the important decisions that will be taken at the next meeting of the executive committee of the High Commission: the approval of an agenda for international protection that will contribute, I am certain, to the debate on the major issues of asylum policy at world level and, consequently, also at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to today’s report, I thank and congratulate the rapporteur for the content of his report. The Commission is certainly proposing to introduce the open method of coordination into the field of asylum and immigration policies. I wish once again to make it clear, however, that we do not consider there to be any incompatibility between the open method of coordination and the adoption of legislative measures on asylum at European level. In fact, adopting legislation is an important part of creating a common asylum policy; the management of asylum policy can benefit from the open method of coordination, from convergence and from the harmonisation of the practices, measures and guidelines implemented by national administrations in the field of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not hide the fact that not all the Member States are in agreement on applying the open method of coordination to the asylum policy. The fact is, however, that the Council itself recently followed the guidelines proposed by the Commission to request the creation of a network of actors in the field of asylum with a view to exchanging information and to studying current practices. The Commission, for its part, intends to use these instruments to identify new fields of action in relation to asylum – not only a comparison of policies, but also the idea of sharing best practice. There is, therefore, no contradiction between the open method of coordination and communitarisation, as generated by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and we even think that in the European Convention on the Future of Europe and in the context of the future Intergovernmental Conference, this compatibility between these two types of instruments must be demonstrated and emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second dimension of the report: we will deal with the issue of the balance between internal security and the obligations of protection. The Commission maintains, in the document that we forwarded to Parliament on the relationship between safeguarding internal security and complying with the obligations and instruments of international protection, that it is possible to achieve an equitable balance between improving internal security in Europe, especially following the events of 11 September 2001, and ensuring that the rights of refugees and other values that are crucial to Europe’s democracies are protected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that the report we are debating here today shares this basic approach and recommends that genuine refugees and asylum seekers must not be victims of the events of the last year, but also that no opportunity must be given to those who support or commit terrorists acts to gain access to the territory of the Member States of the European Union. For this reason, the Commission fully supports the guideline adopted and reiterated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, that the appropriate approach to follow must not be based on major changes to the refugee protection system but must be based instead on the application of the exceptions to the protection conferred by the Convention on refugees in the form of exclusion clauses. We share the opinion that these clauses must be used in accordance with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees’ own interpretation of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise that the Commission subscribes to the European Parliament’s explicit call to reaffirm the Union’s policy that individuals cannot be extradited to countries where they could face the death penalty for their crimes and where there are no acceptable guarantees that can be legally enforced within the framework of a fair and equitable trial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, there are some remaining concerns which we express in the explanatory statement, such as the excessive exploitation of the sense of insecurity in order to adopt restrictive or repressive measures, not only in relation to asylum seekers, but also towards immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions – as approved by the Committee – supports the implementation of the Community action programme against discrimination, racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern is that the Council may adopt more restrictive national positions in relation to the right to asylum. In Seville, we saw the differences between the various States with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Committee on Petitions receives petitions relating to the refusal of asylum. Some are more important and more justified than others, it is true. Last week we received one which is unusual, from an American citizen requesting asylum in Sweden, because he believes he is being persecuted in the United States and that he is being excessively pressurised. Sweden refused him that asylum request and he contacted the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">This request, which is unusual, demonstrates the complexity of the problem and the need to find a balance, as the Commissioner said, between the right to asylum and the citizens feeling secure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It often appears as if we are stuck on a road going nowhere. However tendentious this House's debates on the subject may have been, MEPs are not at fault in this. Although we have done prompt work in this area, we have a right to be consulted and nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware, the Council has to reach a decision unanimously. This does of course mean that the Commission deserves all praise for trying to find new ways ahead, but I tell you that the open coordination method is not a solution – at any rate, not in Parliament's eyes. Unlike the rapporteur, the PPE group is firmly opposed to the introduction of an open coordination method in the area of asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We see an open coordination method as leading to the Community decision-making procedure being bypassed and to Parliament being left on the sidelines. That would be the first step towards returning<span class="italic"> </span>asylum policy to the intergovernmental level and towards asylum policy ceasing to be one of the European Community's responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the fact that a majority in the Convention are convinced that asylum should continue to be governed by Community rules, we cannot and must not allow Parliament, which is the only European institution with any democratic legitimacy, to be shut out from the process of shaping a common asylum policy. That being the case, we in the PPE Group reject Mr Evans’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has other reasons for rejecting the report. The first is the call for a restrictive interpretation of the exclusion clauses of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. The second is the demand that it be ensured that applications are first examined by reference to the inclusion clauses of the Geneva Convention on Refugees, before any grounds for exclusion are taken into consideration – a deviation from current legal practice – and that accelerated procedures or admission procedures should not be used in such cases as a matter of routine. Thirdly, we reject the demand that routine checking for grounds for exclusion be prevented in the course of the processing of asylum applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor will we in any way approve any attempt at nullifying Eurodac. We simply cannot have a situation in which biometric data – even fingerprints – taken from asylum seekers cannot be used for the purpose of investigating criminal offences. Security is of great value to the citizens of the European Union, just as it is to those who come here seeking protection and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the PPE Group can approve Mr Evans’s report only if a plenary vote adopts extensive changes which we, the European People's Party, have submitted in the form of amendments. Parliament must, though, firmly reject the open coordination method.</p>

<p class="contents">While here we are discussing whether or not we want an open coordination method, the debate in the streets focuses on the more than fifteen deaths there have been off the Italian coasts, on the endless people, bodies, which appear on the coasts of the South of my country, on situations such as Sangatte, which the European public find truly exasperating, in two ways: on the one hand, because we find this situation distressing, and on the other, because the prevalent feeling seems to be that we are facing chaos, a situation of insecurity which is out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we want Community procedures for asylum. We believe that the current situation cannot continue and we are therefore prepared to support the European Commission’s proposal on the open coordination method as a step forward on the common policy. Naturally, the open coordination method cannot replace the necessary legislative approximation and harmonisation, but it can aid the establishment of these policies, in relation to which we must effectively increase the role of the European Parliament, as well as the collaboration of the UNHCR and the NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I believe we must remember more that asylum is a right that our States grant to persecuted people – which is due to our States’ and our citizens’ commitment to freedom. Therefore, the societies offering asylum should feel pride and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore – and I am now referring to the second part of the report – in favour of this asylum system functioning properly. I believe that providing the best possible security means also providing the best possible measures for protecting these people. I believe that the application of the Geneva Convention and greater care with the methods we have established, not in relation to asylum, but in relation to other types of legislation, such as the common definition of terrorism or the step forward represented by the European arrest order, are very important and, applied efficiently, should be sufficient to guarantee security without prejudicing the right to asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express our concern with regard to the countries with the death penalty and I would like to say that we are against collaboration with, and naturally expulsion to, those countries and also against the routine and non-individualised review of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I regret that my time has run out because I would like to reply to Mr Turco, but I believe that he has not spoken about this report and I will do so through a point of order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, as a liberal, it is always a pleasure to work alongside Mr Evans.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no issues as momentous for Europe as those of how we deal with refugee and asylum policy, of how we integrate those who are now already within the EU and of how we link asylum policy with the increasing need for an immigrant work force. Our own part of the world, with its ageing population, has a real need for new people. Our internal security is also at issue, of course. Terrorism must not be given free rein within the EU and, on that question, we all of course have a responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be self-evident that we need a common approach to these policy areas within the EU. How, then, do matters look in reality? I know what the solemn declarations say, but I think that the reality is rather different. In quite a few of the EU Member States, for example, national, instead of common, measures have been taken. We are familiar with the debate in Denmark, and we have heard the tenor of the debate in Germany. For the most part, it has been about an impregnable Europe concerned with keeping people out, staving them off, chasing them out and coming down harder on them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against that background that Mr Evans’s report is so important. A balance must be struck between security and international obligations to afford protection. The message is clear. An unrestricted asylum system based on the Rule of Law is needed throughout the EU in which internal security is not protected at the expense of citizens’ rights. A common immigration policy is required in the EU so that the asylum system can be made more relaxed. In this area, the EU can in actual fact learn from the United States, despite the fact that the United States has so often been criticised in this Chamber. A large part of the growth and economic development in the United States in recent years has come about on the basis of a far-sighted integration policy. ‘Better a foreigner in the United States than in Europe’, as someone once put it.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the open coordination method in the field of asylum policy must be that all countries shall fulfil obligations and endeavour to bring about improved standards and greater security, and that is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful for the fact that the rapporteur and the committee have further strengthened their demands that the Rule of Law be applied and for the fact that the candidate countries have been included in the cooperation. That is a proposal from those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. I think it incredibly important for us to state that there should be no possibility of anyone’s being extradited in such a way that they risk the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Klamt, I would say that cooperation and coordination are to be commended within the sphere of asylum too, but that the objective must be that of common legislation. That is something with which I agree. At present, people are herded around Europe like animals. That is not worthy of a Union based on humanitarianism, tolerance and the Rule of Law. I therefore give my wholehearted support to Mr Evans’s report. We must never forget, however, that the Rule of Law must not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism. Terrorism will triumph if we sacrifice the Rule of Law, personal integrity and the protection of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are pleased that we can concur with the rapporteur on his statements on the need to uphold human rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that civil liberties are not secondary to security; we are told that a key value of the European Union is the protection of freedom, justice and civil liberties, and we agree with the last speaker that we need to be vigilant on this. We also fully support the view that the governing principle must be that of international obligations, fairly and humanely applied.</p>
<p class="contents">So for example, we can agree with paragraph 12, that immediate and general detention should be avoided. We also fully support conclusion 5 of the report, which stresses the need for an holistic approach towards asylum and immigration looking at this as a horizontal policy objective and considering all policy areas, particularly those with an external dimension, such as trade, development, environment and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We have long argued that we need to look at the effect of European Union policies in acting as push factors, and after Johannesburg we must be even more aware that what we are aiming for is sustainable development, reducing the causes of seeking asylum. We trust that will form part of the open coordination. We agree with the number of concerns raised about open coordination: in a number of other policy areas, it has almost become a democracy bypass, leaving out the European Parliament and often also national parliaments. But we hope that, through the open coordination method, solutions to difficult issues, such as finding best practice for legal entry for asylum seekers and other immigrants, will be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the asylum system is under pressure and in order to solve this problem, we must give priority to a common immigration policy. Mr Evans gets straight to the point in Paragraph 1 of his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure on the asylum system is indeed considerable. Many asylum seekers are knocking on Europe’s doors. Experience has taught us that the majority of them do not fall within the definition of refugee as enshrined in the Treaty of Geneva. All manner of conceptions have come into being of what a ‘refugee’ actually is, and the Member States have developed secondary forms of protection. How difficult it is to establish any common ground is clearly obvious from the negotiations in the Council on the concept of refugee. It is therefore useful, based on the guidelines proposed by the Commission, to compare notes in terms of the Member States' legislation and policies in order to move forwards in joint partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the solution proposed in Paragraph 1 of the Evans report strikes me as misconceived for different reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, a strange circular argument. The EU Member States, for reasons of their own, do not pursue an active immigration policy. The asylum system is getting overheated because many people who actually fall within the immigrant category still try to enter the EU via the asylum system. They are given the confusing label of ‘economic refugees’. Should we solve this problem by adopting an active immigration policy? That strikes me as a futile exercise. Surely, it will first have to be established that these people are not entitled to asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thereafter possible to address the content of the notion of an immigration policy. Is this desirable for the European Union? I think that the views on this are very different in each Member State. This is also evident from the reactions to the Commission communication about an open coordination method for Community immigration policy. Accordingly, the Dutch Government explicitly does not view labour migration as a goal in itself. Research carried out by the Dutch Government has shown that this form of migration does not solve the Dutch problem of an ageing population or the bottlenecks within the labour market. I can imagine that this is probably different for other regions in the EU, but it is certainly not possible to adopt a straightforward, all-purpose policy here.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it would not solve anything. Rather than the asylum system, it would then be the immigration system that would guarantee the best ticket into the European Union. Even if the pressure would be off the asylum system, it would be transferred just as quickly to the immigration system and trigger off the same abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no easy solution to this problem. The best paragraph of the report is that in which a case is made for an integrated vision of asylum and migration issues, trade, development, the environment and agriculture, for as long as the gap between rich and poor is so immense, people will continue to try to build a better future for themselves and their children. This is a solution which will only bear fruit in the very long term, but it is the best one there is.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we in the European Union will need to continue to consider the practical implementation of our asylum and immigration policy, taking as its guidelines the notions of compassion and justice. We will need to employ compassion in receiving refugees who have been driven out of their own countries. This involves receiving them under humane conditions, as the report stresses, in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">This should be accompanied by justice, which is not always easy, because it means justice not only in the form of access to the legal system, but also in the form of refusal and deportation.</p>
<p class="contents">The exclusion provisions, which are very topical in the light of the events of 11 September 2001, also fall within the concept of justice. Needless to say, these must be used in moderation and with care, but the admission of people who are denied access elsewhere is, in fact, precariously naïve. If we want to safeguard the security of our citizens, then we ought to apply these provisions, for this has been something of a weakness in recent years. The Netherlands seemed to go out of its way to offer shelter to people who were denied reception in other countries, and is now experiencing the effects of this. I therefore endorse restrictive and careful application, but I urge you to apply the necessary dose of reality. Unfortunately, the world is not a paradise full of well-meaning people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report before us deals with the need for a legal definition of the right of asylum, but item 1 of this report contains what is, or ought to be, an extremely disturbing admission, especially for its author. I am referring to the statement that the asylum procedure is often the only way to gain access to EU territory.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is the case, the European Parliament’s first task is to bolt the door to stop it, to prevent a major, fundamental principle of our legal tradition being distorted either by those seeking to exploit illegal immigration for unlawful ends such as organised crime, for example, whose intention is thus to use this principle as a means of obtaining entry to the European Union for those who not only are not entitled to it but who should be categorically prevented from setting foot on Union soil, or – worse still – by those seeking to enter the Union to carry out terrorist activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur states – and I say this with the utmost respect – in the tone of the author of ‘Alice in Wonderland’ that there is no proof that the right of asylum has been exploited to help terrorists enter the Union. I would like, if I may, to ask this question: since we know that thousands of potential terrorists and fundamentalists have penetrated the European Union – and we do not know how they got here, who they are or what nationality they are – how can we fail to draw the clearly logical conclusion that it is precisely the right of asylum that has enabled many of them to enter the Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last elections abounded with depressing examples of political advantage being taken of situations linked to asylum and immigration issues. The fact is that the drafting of mistaken asylum and immigration policies has contributed to the terrifying increase in xenophobic and racist reactions, which we can only condemn. Hence the need, which is greater than ever, for common immigration and asylum powers, confirmed once again at the Laeken Summit, which reiterated the need for a common asylum and immigration policy to be adopted by 2004. In fact, it is the Europeans citizens themselves who are hoping and calling for action that will add a European value to national policies, whose limitations are becoming increasingly clear, both in terms of security policies and of policies for safeguarding rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are debating today supports the introduction of an open coordination mechanism, in which the implementation of a coordination policy must function as an incentive and as a means of harmonising national legislations and practices. We agree with the comments that Commissioner Vitorino has just made to the House underlining the need for legislative measures to be adopted at Community level. We agree with him not only when he refers to the need for this legislation and to strengthen the Community-led approach that he mentioned, but also because this mechanism, instead of representing genuine communitarisation, is a process that denies the European Parliament an active role in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucial that we create an equitable and effective asylum procedure, because this asylum procedure has frequently been the easiest means of gaining access to Union territory. Although we must be able to separate issues that must remain separate, specifically what falls under asylum and what falls under immigration, it must nevertheless be emphasised that it is equally crucial that we establish a common immigration policy that is rational and credible and which necessarily involves a policy of integrating these immigrants, and of effectively combating illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. Not only for reasons of humanity, but also because we are constantly aware that this is also necessary in order to reduce the pressure that has been afflicting the asylum system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Contrary to Mr Evans’s report, which, despite certain positive aspects, is still too timid in its approach, I believe the right of asylum should be absolute and unquestionable. More generally, however, all EU States need to resolve the situation of the tens of thousands of people who arrive in their territory having fled either dictatorships or types of oppression such as that suffered, for example, by women in certain countries, or simply having fled poverty. All the national governments have an inhumane, reactionary policy in this area, refusing large numbers of these immigrants the right to the appropriate papers to enable them to stay in the country and work. It is unacceptable for a category of men and women to be deprived of all their rights, thus falling prey to slum landlords and to employers looking for poorly-paid undeclared workers.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Parliament wanted to show that it represents progress, at least on this point, it should make its position clear. It should put pressure on national politicians so that immigrant workers are granted not only the legal papers that would allow them to come out of the shadows into the light and live in dignity, but also the opportunity to enjoy the same political, trade union and community rights as all European Union citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, what we have to do today is examine two Commission documents which, due to their nature, scope and objectives, should not be considered together, unless we want to cause confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">This joint consideration of two equally important and sensitive dossiers gives the impression that asylum seekers are potential terrorists. The Commission, however, clearly states in its report that it is unlikely that terrorists would ask to exercise the right to asylum. This is a true paradox. The Member States are in fact trying to escape their international commitments by invoking exclusion clauses where a loose interpretation of these clauses would free them from their commitments, even though these commitments are fundamental with regard to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Given all the difficulties posed by the subject of asylum, and despite all our differences, we must not forget that we are dealing with victims, not with criminals. Only an integrated approach and restrictive application of exclusion clauses can guarantee compliance with the Member States’ international obligations with regard to asylum. Return, expulsion and extradition policies must provide every possible guarantee of respect for human rights, in particular when these people face the death penalty in their country of origin, as well as the social and domestic situation of each country. Do we have the right to send people to countries where civil war is raging, or where there is a daily risk of death in addition to economic and social misery, such as in Algeria or other countries? Non-expulsion is, however, required by the European Union in our association agreements. Extradition implicitly jeopardises the right of every individual to seek asylum when their life is threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">A European solution must also be found with regard to asylum seekers deprived of the right of asylum, who find themselves without any rights and further swell the ranks of illegal immigrants exploited by unscrupulous employers for their own gain, while these people live in inhumane conditions within our European democracies. These men and women have waited such a long time to receive a response from the authorities that they have often formed strong links with the country they are in, having children there, for example, and their links with their country of origin have often become weaker or non-existent. Expelling them would therefore uproot them once again. The only solution now would be to legalise their presence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to make these few points in order to ensure universal respect for fundamental rights, but I support the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is something of a Metternich method rather than a Monnet method, and the use of it by you – the European Commission – is an indication that your own approach to asylum policy has failed. That Mr Evans, the rapporteur, being British, should speak up for open coordination is not that surprising, but it is quite remarkable that you should adduce the Community employment policy as an example of how this method has been successfully used, as you have obviously not been following the current employment situation and the state of the labour market in the EU, otherwise you would be well aware of how open coordination has failed in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make some comments on specific points. In the report, it is envisaged that asylum-seekers' biometric data will not be used in the investigation of crime until there is a separate system of European data protection in place for it. Vote for that, and you leave yourself open to the question as to why the general standard of data protection in the European Union and in its Member States is apparently not sufficient to offer asylum seekers adequate protection against the misuse of data. When it comes to data protection, we in Europe have the highest standards in the world. Why you should want to use such an absurd requirement to prevent the effective implementation of Eurodac and hence the protection of our citizens, remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="contents">That this report should call for the procedure for acquiring refugee status to be speeded up is indeed a good thing. What we are dealing with here is indeed, in principle, just the checking of an application. That, too, is something the PPE-DE Group has been advocating for some time, yet it was your group, Mr Evans, that in various reports advocated one new appeals board after another, guarantees of legal redress that became ever more comprehensive and bureaucratic, the constant reduction of the State's right to submit evidence and hence, of course, more lengthy procedures. It would be nice if you were to back up the words in this report with actions in others.</p>
<p class="contents">With my third observation, I come to what is our main problem. In this report, you have not a word to say about our society's real problems. You have not one word to say about how we should deal with those who support the committing of terrorist acts. What do we do when someone, with the provocation of our public in mind, wants to call his child Osama Bin Laden? What do we do with people who publicly rejoice in the images of 11 September? What do we do with Islamic preachers who preach hatred and violence? How do we respond to people who by their words trample our free and democratic system of government underfoot?</p>
<p class="contents">Do we have to wait until these people commit a terrorist act before we are permitted to deport them, or before they cease to enjoy the rights of visitors? It is that question that is currently being asked over and over again in our societies in view of the situation in which we find ourselves. It is to these questions that we must give answers. There is in fact nothing whatever about that in your report, but these are questions we will have to resolve in many future debates.</p>

The number of asylum seekers in the European Union fell by nearly two-thirds over the first 4 months of 2002, compared with the same period last year, having almost doubled over ten years. In Greece, which is usually generous towards asylum seekers, only 59 out of 2,810 applicants were granted asylum in the first half of 2002. This is a dramatic fall in comparison with 2001, when almost ten times as many applications were granted.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, according to statistics from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, most mass movements of refugees are offered refuge by neighbouring, equally poor countries; fewer are opting to flee to the West, that is when they manage to get here at all. For example, out of four million Afghan refugees, only 38,600 asylum applications were filed in the Union last year, i.e. only one Afghan in a thousand asked for protection from the European Union; most fled to neighbouring countries. These statistics speak for themselves and claims that waves of refugees are supposedly threatening Europe and that we should pull up the drawbridge are groundless.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, of course, xenophobia in the European Union is increasing, while the debate has lost sight of what it is that forces these people to travel so far from home in a bid to escape the endless violation of human rights in their own countries. It is not just that strict controls do nothing to prevent asylum seekers from heading for Europe; they encourage many to try and enter illegally, creating work for gangs of smugglers. And as a result, we end up counting corpses on our borders and coastlines and trying to deal with new forms of slavery and exploitation. We agree with the open method of coordination, Commissioner, but it is hardly an integrated solution to the problem and we trust that we shall have an integrated policy by the end of 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It lines up perfectly with the xenophobia and racism which dominate the European Union, especially after September 11, as the Seville Council made perfectly clear. Unfortunately, the Evans report, give or take a few exceptions, follows in exactly the same vein.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication, which recommends introducing the so-called open method of coordination as a staging post on the road to complete convergence of the Member States' asylum policies, denies to all intents and purposes the spirit of humanity which should underpin asylum arrangements. It sets out new repressive measures, such as front security checks, a biometric database such as the Eurodac fingerprint system, gathering DNA etc., and all at a time when the percentage of asylum applications approved in the Member States of the European Union is already tragically low. For example, according to statistics from the High Commissioner for Refugees, Greece only approved 25 out of 2,838 or 0.8% of asylum applications during the first half of 2002 and only 34 refugees were granted temporary asylum on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures are a disgrace when you think that the overwhelming majority of people seeking asylum in our countries are from places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey, Iran or other countries with serious problems. And, unfortunately, there are more than a few who, instead of being granted asylum, are repatriated – to use the official term – in their country of origin, despite the fact that their very lives are at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may come as a surprise that this last point features amongst the others. Be that as it may, this report sets the seal on the task. It will allow us, I hope, to maintain cohesion and coherence in our approaches and directives and, therefore, to put an end to the utterly inharmonious image that we have been given by a European Union that has been utterly spineless in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The many different types of legislation mean that we must have an overview and I think that the proposed open coordination method between the Member States will help to draft higher standards in this area, whilst encouraging transparency, visibility and, lastly, evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Tampere European Council, we have been seeking to create a European area of freedom, justice and security. These three words must be applied to a single area, where freedom must carry the same weight as security and justice. Hence the need for a common interpretation of law and, I beg of you, a forward-looking approach to an agreed policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European area must also be established with the actors who are present on the ground. It must offer all European citizens protection, and not a refuge from the fear generated by 11 September, this irrational fear which is giving rise to an overcautious withdrawal enabling some people to maintain their xenophobic and racist attitudes in the name of so-called pragmatism. I must reiterate that, behind all these words, there are men, women and children. We would like to ensure their rights are respected, by devoting particular attention to women, children and victims of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as affirming a Europe of human rights, we in Europe also want to affirm, when faced with racism, xenophobia, fanaticism and the death penalty, that we want to establish a Europe of freedoms, as safely as possible, and not a Europe that concentrates on law and order in the name of racism and xenophobia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I should like to make two brief remarks following this most interesting and stimulating debate. Firstly, in reply to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, I would draw her attention to the fact that these two issues were not brought together by the Commission. We addressed them in separate documents. We are discussing both of them today as a result of Parliament's organisational arrangements. For once you cannot blame the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark, in reply to Mrs Klamt and Mr von Boetticher, concerns the open coordination method. Since Amsterdam, it has been quite clear that the development of European asylum policy will take place in two stages ('generations'). The first generation will take the form of minimum common rules on a number of elements of asylum policy; the second generation, later on, will be based upon a common (maybe even 'single') European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">In both generations it is undoubtedly quite clear that legislation will play a key role. You must recognise that, in spite of the fact that sometimes we do not agree on the solutions, the Commission has put forward all the proposals for the first stage of legislation only one year after Tampere. I freely acknowledge before the House, as I have always done, that finding a common level playing field on this legislation, even on minimum common rules, has been difficult in the Council. The Council is about to adopt a very famous rule based on one rule with 15 exceptions. If this was achieved in the field of chemistry it would probably merit a Nobel prize, having one rule with 15 different exceptions, one for each of the 15 Member States. We need to recognise that these minimum common rules are not sufficient. I therefore tried to put forward the idea of having a common European asylum policy by means of the open coordination method. The open coordination method does not go against legislation. However, its objective is to complement the insufficient outcome that I acknowledge will most probably be the concrete result of this first-generation legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention also to the fact that the open coordination method brings transparency into the system. This is the best way to respect the principle of subsidiarity. There cannot be a central managed asylum system in Europe. That would go against the principle of subsidiarity. Each Member State should be entitled to decide and to take into consideration asylum demands, and to decide in which cases they grant asylum status on the basis of minimum common rules at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that we need to exchange best practices, and to exchange information. That does not happen at present, and this means that the open coordination method has an added value in bringing transparency to the way Member States manage the system. Under our proposal, Parliament will be joining this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it plain that I do not want to go against any kind of communitarisation. On the contrary, I am trying to make sure that we take the necessary and consolidated steps to achieve the Treaty objective. I do not think the open coordination method is a cop-out. In the Lisbon agenda you will see a crystal clear reference to the open coordination method. If you see the proposals that the Commission has put forward on economic governance, you will see that our proposal is to use the open coordination method to determine legally-binding targets, making the open coordination method more effective and therefore achieving more concrete results. I respect your disagreement, but I do not think that I am wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
