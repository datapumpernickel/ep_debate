<p>(EN)The Council thanks the Honourable Member for giving his attention to this important question.</p>
<p>The Council has received from the Commission on 29 April 2005 a proposal for a Council Directive on Community measures for the control of Avian Influenza.</p>
<p>This text aims at updating current Community measures on Avian Influenza laid down in Council Directive 92/40/EEC, with the objective of ensuring that Member States apply the most appropriate surveillance and control measures against Avian Influenza and so reduce the risk of major outbreaks of the disease and encourage closer collaboration between veterinary and public health authorities in the Member States.</p>
<p>The Council has already started to work on this text. The Council's examination will continue under the UK Presidency. Once the EP Opinion is available, the UK Presidency will try to reach an agreement on the proposal, taking the EP Opinion into account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has adopted several policy conclusions which are relevant to the Honourable Member's question.</p>
<p>In particular, in its Conclusions of 2 June 2004 on Community Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Planning, the Council identified some key components of the Community strategy to face up to pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>Inter alia, the Council called on the Commission and the Member States to facilitate technical assistance at an operational and a strategic level, to work towards promoting coordination of national plans and conducting a joint evaluation exercise, and to continue to cooperate with the relevant international and intergovernmental organisations, in particular the World Health Organisation, to ensure effective co-ordination of activities in the area of pandemic preparedness planning and response.</p>
<p>On 6 December 2004, the Council adopted Conclusions on a European Response to Emerging Zoonotic Disease.</p>
<p>The Council concludes that a European Action Plan for zoonoses preparedness and control should be established in order to implement an intersectoral and responsive Community strategy to emerging threats from zoonotic diseases. Such a Plan, which the Commission intends to propose, should include integrated public health and animal health policy measures and related instruments.</p>
<p>The Council also called on Member States and the Commission to:</p>
<p>review where appropriate the legal and financial obstacles to addressing properly emerging zoonotic diseases and to develop an approach that guarantees, on a day-to-day basis, risk assessment, risk management and risk communication - including intersectoral cooperation and networking of laboratories - in an integrated way.</p>
<p>to coordinate research activities aiming at addressing challenges in the prevention and management of zoonotic diseases.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council invited the European Food Safety Authority, in close cooperation with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, to present on the basis of the annual Community report on zoonoses a detailed analysis of risk factors and called on the Member States and the Commission to intensify the cooperation with the relevant international and intergovernmental organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0510"></a>

As Colombia's Defence Minister admitted, the kidnapping cost 2 million dollars. The arrest of Granda is unlawful since there is no international warrant for his arrest and the charges are a fabrication. Moreover, the public prosecutor has refused to hand over the evidence to his lawyer, while it is also a problem for the lawyer even to stay in the town where the trial is to be held owing to the conspicuous presence of paramilitary groups.</p>

<p>(EN)The EU has taken note of the decision of the two chambers of the Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to extend the transition period for six months as from 1 July 2005 and of the request by the International Committee for Support to the Transition (CIAT) that this extension should go hand in hand with greater effectiveness and promptness on the part of the transitional institutions. The decision to extend the transition period is in line with the provisions of the peace agreement signed in December 2002 in Pretoria and should enable elections to be organised under satisfactory logistical and security conditions. At the same time, the EU urges the transitional institutions, the political parties and civil society to work together to organise a free, transparent and democratic electoral process.</p>
<p>The EU has contributed to security sector reform, transition and stabilisation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo through the launch in April 2005 of the EU police mission in Kinshasa (EUPOL Kinshasa), and through the launch on 8 June 2005 of its mission to provide advice and assistance for security sector reform (EUSEC RD Congo). The EU and its Member States have confirmed that they are prepared to consider more operational support for the integration of the Congolese army, particularly on the basis of information provided by EUSEC RD Congo.</p>
<p>Through the training of Congolese police and military staff, the EU is contributing to the creation of a secure environment for the holding of the elections. The EU, together with other donors, is also contributing to the financing of the elections that at present is estimated to cost around US $ 468 million. Preparations in terms of voter registration has started in Kinshasa and will continue in the rest of the country. This is an operation in which both the EU and the UN mission in the DRC (MONUC) are involved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU, through its Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, is constantly trying to advise the authorities on how to proceed with the preparations for the elections, while at the same time impressing on them the need to observe the timetable imposed under the Pretoria agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0522"></a>

<p>(EN)In December 2004, the EU and Israel approved in the Customs Co-operation Committee a technical arrangement for the implementation of Protocol 4 to the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Under that arrangement, Israel agreed to indicate on all its export certificates to the EU the name and postal code of the city, village or industrial zone of production. The arrangement has applied since 1 February 2005.</p>
<p>The arrangement constitutes a measure providing a practical way to distinguish between products originating in Israel which qualify for preferential duties and those which do not. According to the EU position and in line with international law, products coming from places brought under Israeli administration since 1967 are not entitled to benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The EU customs authorities are advised to refuse preferential treatment to goods for which the proof of origin certificate indicates that the production conferring originating status has taken place in a city, village or industrial zone which has been brought under Israeli administration since 1967.</p>
<p>The Council has so far received no information that the current arrangement is not working properly.</p>
<p>The Council is currently examining the 16 draft decisions of the joint bodies whereby the Pan-European system of cumulation of origin will be extended to the Mediterranean countries.

<p>At the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 16/17 June 2005, no agreement was reached on the multiannual budget for the period 2007-2013. Apparently, one of the stumbling blocks was that reductions in agricultural expenditure are unacceptable. On the other hand, on 1 August 2004, at a meeting in Geneva, the WTO member countries reached agreement on a framework package designed to put the Doha Round back on track. In that framework package, the European Union undertook to phase out subsidies and other support measures for agricultural products. This will have to be given tangible form before the Ministerial Conference to be held in Hong Kong in December 2005.</p>
<p>How will the European Union honour its commitments under the Doha Round if it refuses to make the requisite financial provisions in a long-term budget?

<p>(EN)Firstly, I wish to emphasise that the Council is of course committed to pursuing the implementation of the measures laid down in the CAP reform.</p>
<p>In this context, funding for the period 2007 - 2013 of measures linked to markets and direct CAP payments is limited by the commitments made at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels in October 2002. The financial estimates of the legislative proposals respected these limitations. Moreover, it is pointed out that the reform of the CAP provides for the transfer, by means of modulation, of some funds initially intended for the first pillar to the second pillar of the CAP, that of rural development.</p>
<p>In this regard, I will point out that the Council (Agriculture and Fisheries) has just reached unanimous political agreement on the Regulation on support for rural development, and the Presidency is counting on its adoption at the next Council on 18 July.</p>
<p>I regard the reformed CAP as representing an asset to the Community in international negotiations. In this regard I would also point out that, in its Resolution on the assessment of the Doha Round, the Parliament welcomed the Agreement of 1 August in the WTO framework. We can all - I am certain - take the view that this agreement in no way calls into question the multifunctional and efficient European agriculture model that has emerged from the successive CAP reforms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0546"></a>

<p>In March 2005, Commissioner Viviane Reding convened a meeting of the European Audiovisual Regulators (EPRA) where it was reiterated that Article 22a of the Television without Frontiers Directive explicitly prohibits any broadcast that incites hatred for reasons of race, sex, religion or nationality. At the meeting it was also agreed that such provisions also apply to third-country broadcasters using a frequency, satellite transmission capacity or an uplink to a satellite belonging to a Member State. Al-Manar incites hate, violence and suicide bombing, spreads anti-Semitic material and does not respect fundamental rights. Al-Manar is being broadcast by using satellite services and capacity of Hispasat (partly owned by the Spanish Government) and by Globecast, a subsidiary of France Telecom. From its Beirut office, the al-Manar signal is sent to Arabsat (www.arabsat.com) and Nilesat (www.nilesat.com.eg).</p>

<p>(FR)The provisions and principles of the 'Television without Frontiers' directive are as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Commission would draw attention to the importance of the freedom of the televised press and information and the right of all European citizens to receive the television broadcasts of their choice, even if these come from non-member countries, subject to compliance with the relevant Community laws in force.</p>
<p>Article 22 of the Television without Frontiers directive clearly prohibits any programmes inciting hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality. This ban obviously applies to Community broadcasters but also to channels transmitted by broadcasters established in non-member countries provided they fall within the scope of the Directive pursuant to Article 2(1). In practice this means broadcasters in non-member countries that make use of a frequency or a satellite capacity granted by, or a satellite up-link situated in, a Member State.</p>
<p>The key issue is who monitors compliance with the provisions of the Directive, and in particular the ban on incitement to hatred. The rules set out in the Television without Frontiers directive are clear: Member States and their competent authorities are responsible for ensuring compliance by broadcasters falling within their jurisdiction, including those of non-member countries, provided the above conditions are satisfied, in other words that the broadcasters make use of a frequency satellite capacity, or a satellite up-link situated in the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>As Al-Manar was broadcast by Eutelsat, the French authorities responsible banned its retransmission via that satellite. The authorities in the Netherlands have taken similar action in the case of the New Satellite System located in The Hague.</p>
<p>According to information just received by the Commission, the Spanish authorities responsible have also recently banned the broadcasting of Al-Manar via Hispasat.</p>
<p>At a meeting on 17 March 2005 convened by the Commission, the chairmen of the broadcasting regulatory authorities confirmed the importance of strengthening mutual cooperation in order to tackle incitement to hatred in programmes from non-member countries effectively. They have agreed on practical measures allowing a more coordinated approach.</p>
<p>As far as the broadcasting of Al-Manar by Arabsat and Nilesat is concerned, it is not legally possible to apply Community rules as channels transmitted by these satellites do not come under the scope of the Directive as they do not use a frequency or a satellite capacity granted by, or a satellite up-link situated in, an EU Member State.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission is examining the options available to it in the context of its relations with the non-member countries concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0485"></a>

<p>(EN)The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in its preventive arm expects Member States to achieve and maintain a medium-term budgetary position of close-to-balance-or-in-surplus in cyclically-adjusted terms. Once a country has reached its medium term objective, the nominal budget balance can breathe with the cycle without risk of the deficit becoming excessive in case of a normal economic slow down. The revision of the SGP has strengthened its preventive dimension. Member States have committed to actively consolidate public finances in economic good times and, as a rule, to use cyclical revenues for deficit and debt reduction. Moreover, Member States of the euro zone or those participating in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism that have not yet reached the medium term objective are explicitly obliged to pursue an annual adjustment in cyclically-adjusted terms and net of one-off measures of 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark. The adjustment should be higher in good times and can be less in bad times. Under the new set of rules, the Commission is expected to issue a policy advice directly to a Member State to encourage it to stick to its adjustment path. At the same time, the revised SGP in its corrective part introduces more room for economic judgment and for taking account of cyclical developments while the rigorous rules-based system of the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) remains in place.</p>
<p>With a view to ensuring effective fiscal surveillance in the EU, the Commission is continuously monitoring the budgetary situation in all Member States and uses its right of initiative at the appropriate time. For instance, the Commission decided recently to initiate excessive deficit procedures for Italy and Portugal, thus supporting the needed fiscal consolidation in these countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0489"></a>

<p>Economic growth in the EU is extremely weak in comparison with Asia and the USA. Economic policy within the EU is almost entirely focused on enhancing supply. There is almost no attempt to stimulate demand. Yet the EU market is bigger that that of the USA, and it should be possible to coordinate efforts to boost not only supply but also demand.

<p>(EN)The economic growth rate in the EU as a whole, and notably in the euro area, has in recent years indeed been lower than in the United States and non-Japan Asia. However, it is important to note that, due to the different demographic developments in these regions, these different growth rates are significantly smaller on a per capita basis.</p>
<p>The economic recovery in the EU that started in the second half of 2003 has been hampered by a lack of demand which partly seems to be related to low confidence among consumers and investors. The oil price increase and the strengthening of the euro had a direct dampening effect but also weighed on confidence. Nevertheless, the Commission expects growth to return to potential in the course of 2005 supported by accommodative macroeconomic policies leading to domestic demand taking over as the main driving force in the euro area and the EU (see Commission Spring 2005 Economic Forecasts).</p>
<p>The Commission notes that attempts to increase demand in the short term via a more expansionary fiscal policy could negatively affect the growth performance via its effects on confidence. A further increase in public spending or unfunded tax cuts could reinforce uncertainties about future fiscal sustainability and be offset by reduced spending on private consumption and investment, leading to an overall impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth that could be negative. As such policy cannot durably increase potential output growth; it is more important that fiscal policy contributes to economic stabilisation and prepares for the impact of ageing populations on public finances.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the main contribution macroeconomic policies can make to sustained growth and employment in the current economic situation runs through the preservation of sound macroeconomic conditions and the cushioning of shocks to the economy. Monetary policy can contribute by pursuing price stability and, subject to this being achieved, by supporting other general economic policies. Fiscal policy can play a role in stabilising the economy by allowing the free play of automatic stabilisers. Given the size of automatic stabilisers in the EU, which are twice the size as in the United States, the contribution to demand stabilisation should not be underestimated. Apart from contributing to economic stabilisation, fiscal policies can support growth through expenditure directed towards growth enhancing investment and through tax structures oriented towards growth and employment. In view of the main weaknesses of the Union’s economy (comparatively low labour input and low level of productivity growth) the Commission proposed for the period 2005-2008 a combination of growth and stability-oriented macroeconomic policies, microeconomic reforms to raise the Europe’s growth potential and employment policies conducive to creating more and better jobs.<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission believes that a concerted effort providing clarity on the reforms set out in the renewed Lisbon strategy, together with progress in achieving sound and sustainable public finances will enhance confidence among European consumers and businesses, which is a prerequisite for unlocking pent-up demand.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission is in favour of any initiatives that draw public attention to the challenges of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It welcomes the simultaneous organisation of concerts designed to encourage the G8 leaders meeting in Gleneagles to make a stronger commitment to combating poverty.</p>
<p>In order to enable the developing countries in general, and Africa in particular, to achieve the Millennium Goals, it is crucial that there should be an increase in the quality and quantity of aid.</p>
<p>At the European Council on 16 and 17 June 2005 the Member States of the Union undertook to continue to increase their official development assistance budgets and to go beyond their Monterrey commitments by setting the new individual minimum target of 0.51% by 2010, and 0.17% for the new Member States, which would bring the Union's collective effort up to 0.56%.</p>
<p>This commitment represents an increase of €20 billion a year. In 2004 the 25's official development assistance amounted to €43 billion.</p>
<p>Increased resources and more effective aid are vital but will not be sufficient to achieve the MDGs. There are other Community policies that can make a substantial contribution to development, hence the concept of 'development coherence'. The Commission proposes to produce a mid-term 'coherence report' between the UN Summit in September 2005 and the next international evaluation of the MDGs.</p>
<p>The Commission also hopes that the World Trade Organisation meeting in Hong Kong will produce tangible results that enable the poorest countries, and in particular sub-Saharan Africa, to participate to a greater extent in global markets.</p>
<p>The Commission applauds the G8's success in achieving multilateral debt relief for the poorest countries. This decision is a welcome and significant addition to the decisions on financing for development. Preliminary indications suggest that the funding effort will be of the order of 1 to 2 billion euro a year. The Commission appeals to the other major donors to step up their efforts to help achieve the Millennium Goals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0476"></a>

<p>(FR)Microfinance is a key instrument for helping those most in need to implement their economic initiatives and to be stakeholders in improving their living conditions. The Commission is keenly aware that 2005 is the Year of Microcredit, which should enable it to push microfinance even further up the development agenda.</p>
<p>The Commission will publish a call for proposals for microfinance projects in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in 2005. This call for proposals will help projects that are designed to strengthen the infrastructure of microfinance institutions and that encompass training, consultancy and the procurement of important equipment. The programme also takes action at government level in ACP countries to help them improve their regulatory framework for microfinance.</p>
<p>The Commission has already set up a political framework for its microfinance operations. The 1998 Communication on ‘Microfinance and Poverty Reduction’ sets out the Commission’s approach in the area of microfinance. With regard to continuity of support for microfinance, the Commission’s commitment will stretch beyond 2006, as the programme will continue to operate in ACP countries until 2009. Furthermore, if the demand for funding exceeds the programme’s available resources, the Commission envisages an increase in those resources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0500"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission shares the honourable Member’s concern for the fate of political prisoners held in Cuba. When I visited Cuba in March, I raised the issue of political prisoners with all of the people to whom I spoke, including President Castro. The Commission has also publicly expressed unequivocal condemnation of Cuba’s unacceptable attitude towards MEPs who sought to attend the Assembly to Promote Civil Society, held in Havana on 20 May.</p>
<p>The Commission’s delegation in Havana has lent its full support to contact between MEPs and human rights activists in Cuba. Examples of this support include meetings arranged at the delegation between MEPs and dissident representatives in March, support for Oswaldo Payá’s application for an exit visa and the video conference arranged in March between a group of MEPs and a number of dissidents, including Marta Beatriz Roque.</p>
<p>On 13 June, the Council reaffirmed that the 1996 common position remains in force. In the context of relations between the EU and Cuba, this common position is intended to encourage a transition towards democratic pluralism and respect for human rights.</p>
<p>The Commission remains in favour of pursuing a policy of constructive engagement through political dialogue with the Cuban authorities, even though there has been no progress on human rights in recent months. The Council’s decision of 13 June reinforced the need to use such dialogue to make practical progress in the area of human rights.</p>
<p>The fact that contact with dissidents and representatives of civil society has been stepped up in recent months, within the framework of the guidelines adopted by the Chefs de Mission in Havana in January 2005, is certainly a step in the right direction. This contact will continue and be stepped up further.</p>
<p>Dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society is a more effective means of encouraging peaceful transition in Cuba than sanctions and isolation.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that this policy of constructive engagement is also the policy that stands the greatest chance of securing the release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0538"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission absolutely agrees about the need to set up a support instrument ensuring swift and efficient implementing procedures for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries. This was one of our main concerns when drawing up the relevant proposal for regulation, adopted by the Commission on 22 June this year.</p>
<p>Implementation of the special assistance framework for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas has indeed been subject to delays due, inter alia, to complex Community procedures. This has definitely been taken into account and the Commission is confident that the implementation of the support measures for the Sugar Protocol countries will be more effective, in particular in view of the following characteristics:</p>
<p>management of the assistance scheme will be the responsibility of the delegations from the outset;</p>
<p>the Commission proposes specific financial and human resources to ensure its management, both in the delegation and at head office;</p>

The Commission encourages them to take an active role in this process, so as to have a good basis for the implementation of its support as soon as the instrument proposed by the Commission comes into force.</p>

As regards the follow-up to the budget line in question, the Community budget’s new structure is being drawn up and, to this end, the Commission is preparing a strategy on the thematic programmes, including in the area of human and social development, which it plans to implement under the financial perspective for 2007-2013. The Commission will table practical proposals on the future financial resources as part of the process of drawing up those strategies.</p>
<p>As regards the ‘decency gap’, created in 2002 by the US Government’s decision to suspend aid to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Commission has awarded an additional EUR 22 million to this organisation, along with EUR 10 million to the International Planned Parenthood Federation. This money has been used to finance ongoing programmes and activities.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the European initiative on reproductive and sexual health launched by the Dutch Presidency in 2004, the Commission has decided to award the UNFPA and extra EUR 15 million under the ninth EDF for the purpose of purchasing hygiene items, condoms and products of a similar nature in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in need of them. Over the next few years, the Commission will provide support to the UNFPA in the form of making financial resources available for thematic activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0448"></a>

<p>According to an article entitled 'Risk Based Consumption Advice for Farmed Atlantic and Wild Pacific Salmon Contaminated with Dioxins and Dioxin-like Compounds' published in May 2005, (Foran et al., 2005, Environmental Health Perspectives, 113:552-556), substances such as PCBs, toxaphene, dieldrin, dioxins and polybrominated diphenyl ethers were found in much higher concentrations in salmon from European fish farms than in salmon from fish farms in North and South America.

The authors of the study therefore recommend European consumers not to consume salmon from European fish farms more than four times a month, whereas Americans may eat salmon up to ten times a month.</p>

<p>(EN)The Honourable Member’s question refers to the fish consumption advice given in the article “Risk Based Consumption for Farmed Atlantic and Wild Pacific Salmon Contaminated with Dioxins and Dioxin—like Compounds” published in May 2005. In the Plenary Session of February last year, Commissioner Byrne commented that this study did not raise new food safety issues as the levels found are consistent with the results from other surveys or from official control.</p>
<p>The fish consumption advice in the aforementioned article is based on a guidance value for tolerable intake levels for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs derived by a not internationally recognized approach in risk assessment, as confirmed in a scientific colloquium organized by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in June 2004.</p>
<p>The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) of the European Food Safety Authority has very recently, on 22 June 2005, adopted a scientific assessment of the health risks related to human consumption of wild and farmed fish. This assessment has been made at the formal request of the Parliament and focused on different fish species (farmed, wild, marine, freshwater, lean and oily) marketed to a significant amount in the European Union.</p>
<p>The EFSA CONTAM Panel concluded that species, season, location, diet, life stage and age have a major impact on both the contaminant and nutrient levels of fish, including salmon. These levels vary broadly within species and between species in both wild and farmed fish. When taking these factors into account, no consistent differences in nutrient and contaminant levels between wild and farmed fish, including salmon, could be observed.</p>
<p>The CONTAM Panel concluded that for the consumer, there are no differences between wild and farmed fish, including salmon, with respect to their safety.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CONTAM Panel concluded there is convincing evidence that fish consumption, including farmed fish, and especially fatty fish, benefits the cardiovascular system and is suitable for secondary prevention in manifest coronary heart disease and may benefit the foetal development.</p>
<p>The CONTAM Panel stressed also that unfortunately no agreed methodology exists at present to compare in a quantitative way the risks and benefits of fish consumption.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the presence of dioxins and other contaminants is for the Commission a cause for concern. The Commission adopted a comprehensive strategy in 2001 to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment, in feed and in food. The implementation of this strategy will give new impetus to the reduction of dioxins in feed and food, including fish. Therefore it is the intention of the Commission to revise the maximum levels to integrate the results of this strategy. In addition, Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) provides for measures to eliminate or reduce a number of internationally recognized POPs.</p>
<p>Fish, be it farmed or wild, has its place in a well balanced diet to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from its positive health effects. The scientific opinion of EFSA related to the safety assessment of wild and farmed fish provides the scientific support for this approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0475"></a>

<p>“The occurrence(of disease) in the region is linked to traditional animal production including backyard and subsistence poultry production, multiple animal species farming practices as well as live poultry marketing systems”.</p>
<p>Thus, intensive farming is not identified the decisive risk factor for disease occurrence and spread.</p>

<p>The Commission considers that the situation is more complex.</p>
<p>The factors that may contribute to the occurrence of animal diseases and to the amplification of their effects, including density of animal populations and on-farm biohazards, will be addressed by a new EU Animal Health Strategy.</p>
<p>In view of the development of a new EU Animal Health Strategy to improve the prevention and control of animal disease in the EU, as announced by the Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Protection at the Agriculture Council in December 2004, the Commission plans to propose a Communication in 2007 setting out actions for 2007-13. As a key element in building this strategy, the existing EU animal health policy will undergo an external evaluation based on a participative approach. Final conclusions and recommendations can be expected by mid-2006. The ensuing policy options and their impacts (economic, environmental and social) will be studied through this evaluation process, and will form part of an impact assessment.</p>

<p>(EN)The EUROBAROMETER survey in question highlights consumers’ difficulties in identifying food produced in a more animal welfare friendly manner. In addition, it highlights their willingness to pay more for welfare friendly products and their high levels of certitude of influencing animal welfare by their purchasing choices.</p>
<p>This survey supports data already collected by a Community-funded research project on “Consumer concerns about animal welfare and the impact on food choice”.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Report to the Council and Parliament in 2002 on “Animal welfare legislation on farmed animals in Third Countries and the implications for the EU” highlighted the issue of labelling regimes as a possible means for producers who implement higher welfare standards to recoup the value of their costs and investments, as consumers may be willing to pay a premium for those products. The Commission is exploring this possibility.</p>
<p>A current Community-funded research project entitled “Welfare Quality” will further investigate consumers’, retailers’ and producers’ concerns with regard to animal welfare. This project will be hosting a workshop in Brussels on 17-18 November 2005 which will enable stakeholders to help to shape the future direction of this research through open dialogue.</p>
<p>Notably a recent Commission proposal for a Directive on broiler chickens also provides that the Commission will submit a specific report to the Council and Parliament on the issue of mandatory food labelling based on compliance with animal welfare standards. This report will take account of socio-economic issues and World Trade Organisation (WTO) considerations.</p>
<p>Data from the afore-mentioned studies will be very relevant in identifying various strategies (such as labelling) to address consumers’ concerns about animal welfare. The Commission will also study how to overcome barriers to consumers expressing ethical preferences in their food choice.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission believes that clear food labelling has the potential to offer important benefits to consumers, while not disadvantaging producers. In fact, the Commission thinks that labelling will eventually render these products more competitive in effect to the benefit of the industry and in particular, to those who produce in an animal welfare-friendly manner.</p>
<p>Indeed experience from the application of existing voluntary labelling schemes has shown that marketing advantages may accrue from such initiatives. While studies continue on precisely how much different forms of labelling are used by consumers, consumers have a legitimate right to demand and receive clear product labelling, including an indication of compliance with animal welfare standards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0483"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission fully shares the concerns of the Honourable Member on this important question, and would like to recall the concrete actions it is taking on the issue. In June 2001, the Council adopted the Recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, in particular children and adolescents. The Recommendation was largely due to the widespread public, media and political concern at the possibility of so called alcopops marketed to appeal especially to children.</p>
<p>The Recommendation lists a set of measures that the Member States could undertake to prevent alcoholic beverages being designed for and marketed to young people. It recommends that Member States should, among other things, encourage the establishment of effective mechanisms in the fields of promotion, marketing and retailing to ensure that producers do not produce alcoholic beverages specifically targeted at children and adolescents.</p>
<p>The Recommendation invites the Commission to report on the implementation of the proposed measures no later than the end of the fourth year after the date of adoption of the Recommendation and regularly thereafter.</p>
<p>The Commission is at present preparing the report, which is due by the end of this year. Hence the Commission is in the process of establishing a comprehensive picture of the measures undertaken by the Member States, but we know for example that the beverage alcohol industry and/or the advertising industry have in several Member States responded to the concern by launching or strengthening existing self-regulation structures, which also include complaint procedures.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the honourable member’s attention to Council Conclusions of 5 June 2001 on an EU strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, which invites the Commission to put forward proposals for a comprehensive Community strategy aiming at reducing alcohol-related harm and setting out a timetable for the different actions. The strategy should comprise a co-ordinated range of Community activities in all relevant policy areas, in fields such as research, consumer protection, transport, advertising, marketing, sponsoring, excise duties and other internal market issues. The Commission is at present preparing the strategy, which is also due by the beginning of next year. As harmful drinking patterns are on the rise among young people and marketing is a global industry, the Commission has already identified under-age drinking and commercial communication as key areas for the strategy.</p>
<p>Television without frontiers Directive is also important in this respect. It lists several criteria TV advertising for alcoholic beverages must comply with. One criterion is that it may not be aimed specifically at minors or, in particular, depict minors consuming these beverages.</p>
<p>The Commission should also like to mention that under the Public Health Programme, it has decided to co-finance a project called ELSA, which will assess the enforcement of national laws and self-regulation on the advertising and marketing of alcohol. In addition this project, which has started this year and lasts until the end of next year, will also provide policy recommendations for the Commission.</p>
<p>On the regulatory side, the proposal on nutrition and health claims, for which the Parliament recently adopted its opinion in first reading, is proposing provisions in Article 4 to restrict the inclusion of certain messages like health claims in the marketing of alcoholic beverages. Such a provision certainly represents a concrete measure in the direction jointly wished by the Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission should like to emphasise, that we should not forget the central role of Member States in tackling alcohol-related harm. An integrated approach needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0490"></a>

<p>However, apart from certain products of animal origin, no specific temperature criteria are set down in Community legislation. It is indeed considered more appropriate and efficient to address the issue of storage temperature conditions for foodstuffs at food business operators' level rather than at Community level.

<p>This approach continues to prevail in the new hygiene framework that will be applicable from 1 January 2006.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efforts should be made to better educate consumers on the necessary compliance with storage conditions specified by producers on food packaging.

<p>(EN)While it is true that population rates are predicted to fall in many Member States over the coming decades, it is important to note that this is not due to a rise in infant or maternal mortality. In fact, infant and maternal mortality has fallen across all Member States, even though there are still wide variations between countries.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to point out that recent figures on infant mortality contained in EurLife, the interactive database on living conditions and quality of life in Europe from the European Foundation for the improvement of Living and Working Conditions, corroborate the above considerations. The data provided cover the 25 current EU Member States and three candidate countries: Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have powers to directly propose public health safety standards and measures; this is primarily a matter for the Member States. Under the public health action programme, there could be scope for the exchange of information and experiences on good practice in different Member States; here, funding priorities depend on the respective annual work programmes.</p>
<p>More broadly, EU legislation on health and safety at work provides for the protection of pregnant women at the workplace. In particular, Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the safety and health of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth provides, among other things, for a minimum maternity leave of at least 14 weeks allocated before and/or after confinement.</p>
<p>There have been a number of research projects in this area, covering public health, diagnostics and technological aspects. The Commission proposal for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme which still to be approved by the Council and the Parliament, offers, at this stage, some favourable prospects for research around the theme raised by the question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0528"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission considers as a priority the replacement of biological tests using rodents to verify the absence of biotoxins in shellfish. It is working very closely on this with the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods, ECVAM.</p>
<p>Intoxication with biotoxins of bivalve molluscs is quite a serious form of food poisoning that can be picked up from shellfish. Member States are required to test for their presence and, if detected, the shellfish production areas are closed until the problem has been resolved.</p>
<p>There are many different shellfish toxins and validated non-animal tests are available for many but not for all types. Consequently the reference method to detect all these toxins and prevent toxic shellfish being harvested remains the mouse bioassay.</p>
<p>The Commission has been active in attempting to replace biological tests by alternative tests for many years. The Commission has more recently asked the Community Reference laboratory in Vigo (Spain) to develop, in cooperation with ECVAM and with the assistance of the National Reference Laboratories, alternative methods by the end of 2005. This process will of course also take account of international developments, and notably recent work in the United States on a chemical test method for PSP, currently undergoing validation in Europe.</p>
<p>Current legislation allows Member States to use validated non-bioassay tests where they exist. However, alternative chemical methods can replace biological methods only if they give equivalent results in the matter of sensitivity and diagnostic reliability.</p>
<p>The Commission would encourage Member States to continue work in this area and to share their results, methods and reference materials.</p>
<p>When enough alternative methods have been validated so as to cover all toxins, the Commission would be very pleased to propose that Community legislation be modified to move entirely away from the mouse bioassay for good.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The tsunami that hit the countries around the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004 was one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history. The response to the tsunami has been extraordinary. The international community has responded with great generosity pledging over € 6.2 billion on emergency relief and reconstruction, matching the general level of needs in the most affected countries.</p>
<p>The Commission has been a leading part of that international response. At the Jakarta Donors’ Conference in January, the EC pledged € 123 million for humanitarian support and € 350 million for longer-term rehabilitation and reconstruction support. The longer-term support will focus on the worst affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The other affected countries (India and Thailand) indicated to the EC that they do not need EC support which should be focused on more needy countries. It should be noted that the total assistance pledged by the EC for humanitarian and reconstruction support (€ 473 million) is in line with other donors larger pledges (Japan € 385million, United States € 700 million, Australia € 590 million, Canada € 265million, World Bank € 195 million, Asian Development Bank € 385 million). Moreover, the European Union is the largest donor with about € 2.3 billion from the total international pledged aid of about € 6.2 billion.</p>
<p>Most of the EC support for reconstruction will pass through Multi-Donor Trust Funds with the World Bank as trustee. Trust Funds will reinforce donor coordination and ensure transparency, efficiency and flexibility. In all circumstances the Commission will ensure that the use of funds when channelled through trust funds is in line with international fiduciary standards and that adequate transparency and regular reporting is provided on the use of funds. This is ensured in the case of Indonesia and Sri Lanka by having as trustee the World Bank to directly manage the flow of funds, and in the case of Maldives having the assurance of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank that the Government is using a financial management system that is adequate and in line with international standards.</p>
<p>The programmes co-financed with International Organisations (such as the United Nations and Asian Development Bank) equally apply international financial management standards and reporting. In all other cases the Commission will be in charge of the direct management of funds, and will ensure sound financial management and reporting in accordance with the Financial Regulation<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and our internal procedures.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to monitoring and reporting, there will be regular reporting mechanisms that the trustees operating the Trust Funds will have to provide to donors. The Commission has retained specific resources for the EC to launch independent progress monitoring reviews on the performance and achievements of each individual Trust Fund. Adequate and regular information will be provided to EP and Council on these progress reports.</p>
<p>The Commission will allow the highest importance to a good allocation of resources and the prevention of any misappropriation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)As the Commissioner in charge of Trade and the Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid have emphasised on several occasions, European Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are not classical free trade agreements but are designed as tools for development and the promotion of regional economic integration. They will serve as stepping stones for the integration of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in the global economy and the multilateral trading system.</p>
<p>Liberalisation of ACP imports is not the main objective of EPAs. The first and decisive step of the EPA process is to support the creation of regional markets, which should ideally comprise the adoption of common external tariffs. Regional preference, including vis-à-vis EU imports, will be an important element of this policy.</p>
<p>Only at a later stage will ACP regions open their markets to EU products, progressively and over time. The transitional periods and sectors concerned will be agreed together with each respective ACP region in accordance with their development needs. Regarding agriculture, talks will take into account rural development and food security concerns. More specifically, a substantial part of ACP imports could still be protected under safeguard provisions if necessary. Furthermore, a key element in these discussions will be revenue effects and how to address them, where required. Addressing problems might include development assistance and diversification of sources of public revenue.</p>
<p>The Commission will use EC development assistance to support the ACP countries and ensure they gain maximum benefit. This assistance will be available during the negotiations and beyond. The Commission has already put in place a substantial trade related assistance package for ACP countries of around € 650 million. Part of this is earmarked directly for strengthening the negotiating capacity of the ACPs. At every stage, the EPA process will be under review, to ensure that the EPAs deliver on the promise to put development first.</p>
<p>The EPA negotiations are conducted in a transparent manner. Regular briefs are delivered and consultations held with all interested stakeholders, including Parliament, Member States, civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), in order to ensure that their views are taken into account.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0453"></a>

<p>The Turkish Supreme Court decreed on 25 May 2005 that the teachers' organisation Egitim Sen would be disbanded. The organisation will lose its right to represent almost 200 000 members in dealings with authorities or employers.</p>
<p>The situation stems from Egitim Sen's support in its constitution and policy documents for the principle that all children should have the right to tuition in their mother tongue and that all individuals should have the right to personal development on the basis of their own cultural background. The Supreme Court considers this to be contrary to the Turkish Republic's Constitution, which stipulates that all education shall be in Turkish.</p>
<p>The Commission has already acknowledged that Turkey maintains substantial restrictions on the right of association, the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike, and that Turkey still does not meet International Labour Organisation standards.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission has been closely following the Eğitim Sen case. In May 2005, in a final judgement, the Court of Cassation ruled that the trade union should be closed down. As both Honourable Members state, this union has been found by the Court of Cassation to be in breach of Turkey’s Constitution because an article in its statute supports the right to be educated in one’s own mother tongue (whereas the article 42 of the Turkish Constitution states that education should be provided in the official language, meaning Turkish). The decision of the Court of Cassation reversed two successive rulings of the Labour Court in favour of Eğitim Sen.</p>
<p>The Honourable Members note the possible contradiction with International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions. The Commission strongly supports the effective implementation of the ILO Conventions. In 1998, Members of the ILO, to which Turkey is party, adopted a Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This Declaration incorporates a follow-up that involves an annual review, a Global Report and conclusions about technical cooperation priorities. The Commission will take due consideration of the next review by the ILO Governing Body on the application of freedom of association and the protection of the right to organize in Turkey.</p>
<p>The Commission has also noted the intention expressed by Lawyer Ms. Oya Aydın, defending Eğitim Sen's interests, to bring the issue to the European Court of Human Rights, namely on the grounds that the Ankara Labour Court had stressed that the Turkish Constitution should be interpreted in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights, and that a decision to close down the trade union would not be in compliance with articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 11 (freedom of association) of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Commission has expressed concern at the decision of the Court of Cassation concerning Eğitim Sen, and stated that it appears to be disproportionate and not in compliance with EU and international standards. In the context of its ongoing monitoring of trade union rights in Turkey, the Commission will continue to closely follow the Eğitim Sen case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0456"></a>

<p>(EN)The answer to the question of the Honourable Member relates mainly to the Commission because the Commission plainly has no responsibility for recruitment in the other institutions.</p>
<p>In order to reach a geographical balance in the recruitment of the officials originating from the new Member States, the Council Regulation No 401/2004<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> foresees a transitional period extending from 2004 to 2010 during which it is possible to hold competitions specifically targeted at nationals of the new Member States.</p>
<p>This approach allows smooth integration of officials from the new Member States.</p>
<p>1. As reported in the communication from the Vice-President of the Commission in charge of administrative affairs, audit and anti-fraud dated 22 April 2005<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, it is true that the proportion of Polish officials recruited by the Commission compared to the target set up is lower than the average proportion of the officials originating from the other new Member States.</p>
<p>Priority in recruitment was given to linguists, assistant administrators and secretaries. The need for linguists for each language was estimated to be 80 linguistic A* staff, regardless of the size of the new Member State. As for assistant administrators and secretaries, it was considered more important to have a significant number of laureates from each new Member State rather than to reach a balanced representation of the new Member States in the first year of accession.</p>
<p>In addition, an analysis of the first wave of enlargement competitions showed that there was a significant shortfall in the number of laureates produced in comparison with the number indicated in the competition notices. The situation varied widely from country to country and domain to domain. The audit competition for Polish administrators produced, for example, 13 laureates, whereas the target figure was 40. Similar variations were seen in other competitions.</p>
<p>2. The communication from the Vice-President of the Commission in charge of administrative affairs, audit and anti-fraud was made available to all services. If recruitment is looked at on a Directorate general-by-Directorate general basis, the picture varies considerably. This is due to the fact that certain profiles have only recently become, or are not yet, available.</p>
<p>3. An overall geographical balance per nationality will be addressed in the following waves of competitions. The assessment of needs of laureates per new Member State is ongoing. The Commission will, in close collaboration with EPSO, ensure that it has an appropriate balance of staff from each of the new Member States across all categories, including middle and senior management, at the end of the transition period.</p>
<p>4. As regards the utilisation of reserve lists, the Commission wishes to address two misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Firstly, the recruitment process is not slow and the utilisation rates of the EUR10 Administrators lists clearly show that recruitments of Polish citizens from the reserve lists are well above the average. The Commission has recruited 67% of the laureates on the Polish reserve lists in comparison with 50% of the overall EUR10 reserve lists.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fact that the reserve lists validity is limited to 31 December 2005 does not necessarily imply that they will expire that day. The Appointing Authority (EPSO, in the present case) may extend their validity (and experience shows that where the number of laureates still on the list is significant, the Appointing Authority is likely to do so).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission and Member States therefore continue to call on the Burmese authorities to undertake decisive steps to improve the situation in these areas. Unfortunately the situation has not improved so far.</p>
<p>Recent information that groups from Shan State National Army have broken the ceasefire agreement with the military junta, leading to increased clashes between Shan soldiers and government forces. These clashes have allegedly provoked an influx of Shan refugees to Thailand. This is a worrying development and the Commission continues to monitor the situation very closely.</p>
<p>Thailand is not a party to the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) maintains offices in Bangkok and along the border, but only on the basis of working arrangements. Accordingly, the Thai government does not grant full refugee status to displaced people arriving from Burma/Myanmar. However, authorities have de facto provided shelter and protection on Thai soil.</p>
<p>The Commission Delegation in Bangkok, in full coordination with representatives of EU Member States, remains in close contact with the Thai authorities, including Foreign Affairs and the National Security Council, on the issue of Burmese refugees, to ensure that they are treated according to International standards.</p>

<p>(EN)By the 1930s, with the automobile a common part of daily life, the number of motor vehicle deaths was continually increasing and vehicle designers saw a clear need to do some research on ways to make their products safer.</p>
<p>In America work began on collecting data on the effects of high-speed collisions on the human body in the late 1930s when there was no reliable data on the response of the human body to extreme physical conditions and no effective tools existed to measure such responses. Biomechanics was a field barely in its infancy. It was therefore necessary to employ test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.</p>
<p>The first test subjects were human cadavers. They were used to obtain fundamental information about the human body's ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a vehicle accident. Research has indicated that as a result of this earlier work, and the design changes consequently implemented, up to 8,500 lives had been saved annually in the United States by the late 1980s.</p>
<p>The information gained from that research was consequently put to good use in the development of what we know today as “crash test dummies”. These dummies provide a consistent instrument in the testing of vehicles and are continually being upgraded and made more biofidelic. It is only by using these dummies that vehicles can be tested under controlled conditions and in a manner which is fully understood. The original test dummies, on which most of today’s dummies are based, were originally developed by General Motors in the United States.</p>
<p>Today, under European Union regulation, crash testing where assessment of potential injury levels is required is carried out using specified test dummies which are becoming more and more complex and, as a result, more representative of the real human.

<p>(EN)Albania has made no commitments to the EU regarding the conduct of a new general census of the population. However, in response to requests from the Commission at a number of successive Consultative Task Force meetings, Albania has indeed made commitments regarding data on minorities. Most recently in June 2003 Albania agreed to a joint recommendation that it would collect and make public, before the end of 2003, accurate data on the size of its minorities. This was not done by the deadline set, and although Albania produced relevant figures in February 2004, there was no broad consensus on their accuracy. Further progress is hampered by the difficulty in reaching agreement between the authorities and minority groups on the methodology to be used in gathering data. The Commission continues to encourage close cooperation and dialogue between government and minority representatives, with a view to defining a methodology capable of producing results which are both accurate and accepted by all parties. More generally, Albania’s progress in the Stabilisation and Association Process depends on its satisfactorily addressing fundamental issues such as minority rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0468"></a>

All aircraft falling within the scope of the Regulation have to carry insurance in respect of liability for passengers, baggage, cargo and third parties. The aim of the Regulation is to ensure that damaged parties are financially compensated in the event of an accident, regardless of the financial situation of the operator of the aircraft. The Regulation makes no exception for historic aircraft, because operators of such aircraft can be held liable for damages caused and, consequently, should have an adequate insurance to cover that liability. For that same reason, the Regulation also does not make any difference between Community carriers and carriers from third countries, or whether the aircraft was commercially operated or not. Nonetheless, the owners of rarely used aircraft can influence their insurance costs because the premium levels for these aircraft usually vary with the number of flown hours.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the intention by the Spanish authorities to supply water from desalination plants to regions with water scarcity. The following pieces of EU legislation are of relevance:</p>
<p>1) The Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_55_3" name="refann_55_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>provides for protection of all our waters, rivers, lakes, groundwaters and coastal waters;</p>
<p>covers all sectors of human activity (including thus e.g. waste water discharges from water treatment plants and from desalination plants);</p>

<p>defines ‘good status’ for coastal waters in a comprehensive way, in terms of biological, physico-chemical and hydromorphological quality elements;</p>
<p>submits all point source discharges liable to cause pollution to an authorisation procedure.</p>
<p>2) The Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_55_4" name="refann_55_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>provides for the protection and conservation of habitats and threatened species. The directive requires the designation of sites in the NATURA 2000 network and provides for special assessments if these sites threaten to be impacted by construction projects such as de-salination plants;</p>

<p>(EN)In its White Paper “European transport policy for 2010: time to decide” the Commission envisaged the establishment of passengers’ rights in all modes of transport.</p>
<p>In the Communication on strengthening passenger rights within the European Union of 16 February 2005<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission presented a policy approach on how to extend passenger protection measures to all modes of transport other than aviation. The Commission pointed out three main areas of concern with regard to the international coach transport: the rights of persons with reduced mobility, liability issues and a compensation and assistance in the event of interrupted travel. The Commission has committed itself to examine the best way of improving and guaranteeing the rights of passengers in international coach services in the course of the year 2005/2006.</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission is preparing a consultation document on the rights of passengers in international bus and coach transport containing a detailed questionnaire addressed to the Member States and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the results of the public consultation, the Commission will come up, if appropriate, with a legislative proposal.</p>
<p>In addition to passenger rights, the Commission is also tackling bus and coach safety. Whilst bus and coach travel remains the safest means of road transport (130 fatalities out of 43,700 in 2004), further safety measures are still necessary. The Commission has adopted numerous measures under the road safety action plan, vehicle construction regulations (which improve the safety designs of buses and coaches, including the obligation to install seat belts) and it regulates operator and driver qualifications and conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Honourable Member asks for the Commission’s best estimate of the cost of organised crime last year inside the EU. The costs of organised crime are enormous, whether you want to measure only direct economic costs or both tangible and intangible direct and indirect costs. Different organisations make rough estimates of the cost of selected types of crime, for selected regions and selected periods of time, as does a few Member States of the EU.</p>
<p>A precise quantitative estimate of the cost of organised crime would require an extensive knowledge base containing comparable information on the extent of different types of organised crime in the EU Member States, as well as on the criminal justice response to crime, information on costs for individual victims and business, costs for intangible as well as tangible consequences of crime and for measures taken in anticipation of crime, to reduce or prevent crime or its consequences, to mention only a few necessary parameters.</p>
<p>As outlined in its answer to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0524_EN.html">H-0524/04</a> by the Honourable Member, the Commission is currently working to develop comparable statistics on crime and criminal justice at the European Union level. This work was initialised because it was recognised that one of the main deficiencies in the area of justice, freedom and security is the lack of comparable information on crime and criminal justice. Current compilations of national statistics are not comparable between countries, sub-national information is lacking and existing victimisation surveys do not cover all important crime types, or all EU Member States. The lack of good quality quantitative data specifically on organised crime is an overall problem. The Organised Crime Reports compiled by Europol suffers from a lack of harmonisation of indicators and reporting, to mention only a few problems that hamper the comparability and quantification of organised crime incidence and frequency.</p>
<p>The Commission has funded a study on cost-benefit analyses in crime prevention. The study concluded that only few Member States have data on the cost-aspect of crime. The study was discussed at a seminar on the Cost of Crime, held in Finland last year and co-funded by the Commission’s AGIS-programme, where it was concluded that the issue needs much further work in the European Union.</p>
<p>The task to develop comparable statistics is a long-term goal that will have to be developed over the coming years, in close cooperation with Member States, as collecting information on the basis of harmonised definitions and reporting procedures will demand time and resources both at national and EU levels. A Communication on statistics on crime and criminal justice is planned for the latter part of 2005; it will include an action plan and a Commission decision to set up a consultative committee to advise the Commission’s Directorate General Justice, Liberty and Security (JLS) in the different steps towards comparable statistics.</p>
<p>The end-goal is to have good-quality comparable information on crime and criminal justice, so as to render possible prioritisation, monitoring and evaluation of measures as well as cost-benefit analyses among other important policy tools.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0481"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission is aware of the concern caused by the plan by a private company to set up a system for the transfer of oil between tankers anchored in the Firth of Forth, several miles from the coast in the East Lothian council area of Scotland.</p>
<p>The transfer of oil between vessels is a complex technical operation entailing a considerable risk of oil being spilt into the sea.</p>
<p>The transfer of oil between vessels in territorial waters and ports is carried out under the responsibility of the national authorities. In this connection, it should be stressed that the European Union has laid down standards imposing a strict ban on performing this type of operation from and to single hull oil tankers in waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States. These standards, contained in Regulation EC No 417/2002, have been applicable since October 2003. They will have to be observed if transfers of this kind are authorised by the British authorities.</p>
<p>As regards oil transfer operations between double hull oil tankers, the Commission considers that such operations must be subject to operational guidelines and very strict surveillance on the part of the national authorities responsible.</p>
<p>As far as the transfer of hydrocarbons between vessels at sea is concerned, although the industry itself has laid down recommendations in this area, the idea of establishing a binding framework for such operations will be discussed by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in mid-July 2005. The Commission and several Member States, for their part, favour incorporating rules relating to such transfers into the MARPOL 73/78 Convention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0486"></a>

<p>(EN)Though the reasons behind the recent Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform are manifold, one of the principle aims behind it was to reduce its trade-distorting impact on third countries. As a result, over the ten years since the process began, our use of trade distorting domestic support and export subsidies has dropped dramatically, well in excess of our Uruguay Round commitments. Among others, this has led to a significant reduction in the EU’s share of world agricultural exports in all major commodities. In addition, our border tariffs have also fallen by 36% while our market is also characterised by a generous and extensive preference schemes to imports from developing countries. 2001’s Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative is just one element of the generalised system of preferences that allows developing countries to export often sensitive and economically important agricultural goods to the EU either duty free or under greatly reduced tariff conditions.</p>
<p>The combination of all these factors has substantially diminished the impact that EU agricultural produce has on world markets and world commodity prices. More importantly, it has contributed to a more level playing field in which developing countries could, were others to do the same, compete more efficiently.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU’s position on developing countries has always been clear and comprehensive. It has been a firm supporter of the Doha Development Agenda from the outset, believing very strongly in working towards global trade liberalisation. One of our key concessions in this framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiation has been the proposal to phase out its export subsidies as long as all forms of export subsidisation are eliminated. An ending date of the exports subsidisation will be part of the overall agricultural negotiations and can only be successful if all participants in the multilateral negotiation subscribe to a parallel process of elimination.</p>
<p>One of the best examples to demonstrate the positive by-products of CAP reform is the cotton sector. Although the EU production is negligible on the international scene (2% of the world production) and has no significant impact on the world price, the EU has led the way in reforming its domestic policies on cotton. Starting from 2006, 65% of our cotton subsidies will be no trade distorting. Moreover, the EU does not have export subsidies for cotton and provide free access on cotton.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0493"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission continues to be extremely concerned by the humanitarian situation in Chechnya. The civilian population is the main victim of this longstanding conflict and survives in very dire conditions in a Republic which has been shattered by two wars. Grozny, in particular, remains a city in rubble where very little reconstruction has taken place so far.</p>
<p>A large part of the population in Chechnya, as well as those still displaced in the neighbouring republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan, depends on external humanitarian assistance. However, the main issue at stake, beyond material assistance, remains the protection of civilians, in a context where abductions, disappearances, extra-judicial executions, rape and extortion are common features of everyday life.</p>
<p>The Commission, through European Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), remains the main donor of humanitarian aid to the region, with around € 170 million allocated since the beginning of the second Chechnya conflict in Autumn 1999, including the latest funding decision of € 22, 5 million adopted in April.</p>
<p>However, providing humanitarian assistance to the population in Chechnya continues to be a difficult challenge because of the numerous restrictions on access put forward by the authorities, who want to control the work of humanitarian agencies, and because of insecurity, notably the high risk of kidnapping.</p>
<p>In addition to humanitarian assistance the Commission is preparing a possible contribution to socio-economic recovery in the North Caucasus. This would be part of a policy depending also on progress on the political process, including the holding of free and fair Parliamentary elections later this year. The consultations with Russia on human rights, launched in March, provide a basis for making progress on these issues. In addition the Commission is in the process of discussing the possible modalities for financial assistance with the Russian authorities in order to ensure that the expenditure would provide added value.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0502"></a>

<p>(EN) After having consulted all of the interested parties, the Commission has taken the following measures with regard to the interpreting arrangements used in the Commission’s press office.</p>
<p>On the days when the College meets, the Commission will continue to provide interpretations at press conferences in every official language of the European Union.</p>
<p>For Commissioners’ press conferences held on other occasions, the times and frequency of which it is more difficult to predict, the objective is to provide a full interpreting service in these cases too. For the time being, the intention is to provide as many languages as possible according to the daily availability of the necessary resources.</p>
<p>EPSO can assure the Honourable Member that it has never published in any Italian daily newspaper advertisements for its open competitions in any language other than Italian.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that it has, in line with its decision of 10 November 2004, published senior management vacancies in the Official Journal and in the national and international press in English, French and German. This temporary measure was taken in view of the serious translation constraints that the DGT is facing. With regard to the publication of the Director-General post in the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the Honourable Member should note that Italian applications constituted the second biggest group of candidates, whereas rather few applications were received from applicants with German or English as mother tongues. The Commission is therefore convinced that, de facto, no discrimination exists in relation to senior management vacancies.</p>
<p>The Commission recently decided that it would henceforth publish a short announcement of all senior management vacancy notices in the Official Journal in all languages.</p>
<p>In accordance with Regulation No 1/58 of the Council, all of the official languages are at the same time working languages (Article 1) and can therefore be used with good reason and with equal legitimacy within the institutions.</p>
<p>To ensure that the decision-making process is effective, however, the rules of procedure of the Commission lay down the framework for the language arrangements that apply to the College itself. It therefore falls to the President to decide which languages best meet the minimum requirements of the Members of the Commission and are to be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission works, and is able to adopt decisions, in those languages, unless additional language versions are necessary, in particular for the purposes of the entry into force of an Act or of its notification to its recipients.</p>
<p>Official forwarding to the other Community institutions and/or publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, however, require texts to be made available in all of the official languages of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission is an institution comprised of employees from the various countries of the European Union. In accordance with the spirit of the Treaty, it advocates and practices multilingualism. As such, the internal arrangements of the services (for drafting documents and for holding meetings) are left to senior officials to decide on. For operational reasons and for the purposes of effective communication, certain languages are, without doubt, used more than others by employees of the Commission in the everyday operations of the services. When this happens, the equal status of the languages as official and working languages is, however, recognised.</p>
<p>The Commission does not see the need to lay down additional written rules or to adopt a communication concerning the use of languages within the institutions. It is, however, preparing a communication on multilingualism and the use of languages in European society and on the multilingualism of Europeans.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0503"></a>

<p>Every summer during the months of June, July, August and September, in the regions of Alexandroupolis and Samothraki, trawler fishing in international waters beyond Greek territorial waters is suspended in order to protect marine resources. While the ban applies to all Greek fishermen under Community regulations, it does not apply to the Turkish fishing fleet. The result of this situation is that marine resources are destroyed and Greek fishermen in the region find themselves at a productive and financial disadvantage, having lost the possibility of a 'productive return' each October at the beginning of the fishing season.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to address this situation caused by the activities of the Turkish fishing fleet to the detriment of the marine environment and Greek fishermen and by what means? In the accession negotiations, can the Commission request that the acquis communautaire be extended and applied to Turkey?</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the fact that, as in the case of Greece, the implementation of Community legislation to ensure the conservation and the sustainable management of fish stocks may lead to situations where restrictions are imposed on Community fishermen that may not apply to fishermen from outside the Community who are fishing in the vicinity of waters where EC legislation applies. This is an important reason, among others, why the Commission is keen to strengthen co-operation with other Coastal States of the region with regard to fisheries management and the development of sustainable and responsible fishing patterns in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the Commission has a policy of strengthening the role of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), in particular with a view to making it a more effective tool for the implementation of the actions defined and accepted during the Ministerial Conference for the sustainable development of fishing in the Mediterranean in Venice from 25 to 26 November 2003.</p>
<p>Already at its last meeting in February 2005 the GFCM adopted, on the basis of Community proposals a number of important measures relating to conservation (e.g. minimum mesh size 40 mm, prohibition of trawling beyond 100 metres depth) and the management of the fishing activities (e.g. through the establishment of a register of vessels of more than 15 metres allowed to fish). Furthermore, the GFCM adopted a recommendation concerning the guidelines for the establishment of a control plan which will make it possible to strengthen the control of fishing activities and to combat effectively illegal fishing.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member will know, the general principle in enlargement negotiations is that the candidate country in question accepts the Community acquis. The same approach will be followed with respect to Turkey. Negotiations will be based on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) acquis, which the Commission will present in detail to Turkey during the screening process. The CFP acquis will apply to Turkey upon Accession unless transitional arrangements are agreed in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p>Community assistance is available for institution building and administrative preparation, primarily through twinning projects with partners from Member States co-financed by the Community. Administrative and legal progress in Turkey with regard to applying the CFP acquis is discussed at regular intervals in the sub-committee for agriculture and fisheries under the EU-Turkey Association Agreement.</p>
<p>Under Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 Member States may grant compensation to fishers and owners of vessels for the temporary cessation of activities in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>In the event of unforeseeable circumstances, particularly those caused by biological factors,</p>
<p>Where a fisheries agreement is not renewed, or where it is suspended for the Community fleets dependent on the agreement,</p>
<p>Where a recovery or management plan is adopted by the Council or where emergency measures are decided by the Commission or by one or more Member States.</p>
<p>However, recurrent seasonal suspension of fishing activity, as in the situation shown by the Honourable Member, shall not be eligible for compensation under Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0505"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission formally explained its approach to tax coordination and tax harmonisation in different areas of taxation in its Communication on "Tax policy in the European Union - Priorities for the years ahead" of 23 May 2001<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Honourable Member is referred to this document. While Member States have the main responsibility on taxation matters they have to respect the EC Treaty when exercising their competence, notably the non-discrimination principle, the fundamental freedoms and the State Aid rules.</p>
<p>The Commission strategy for providing companies with a consolidated corporate tax base for their EU-wide activities is not aimed at full harmonisation and in particular does not infringe Member States' right to set tax rates. The Commission's policy is laid down in two Communications: "Towards an Internal Market without tax obstacles - A strategy for providing companies with a consolidated corporate tax base for their EU-wide activities"<a href="#defann_68_2" name="refann_68_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and "An Internal Market without company tax obstacles – achievements, ongoing initiatives and remaining challenges"<a href="#defann_68_3" name="refann_68_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the field of VAT and other indirect taxes, to a certain extent a higher degree of harmonisation is necessary in order to ensure that the internal market without internal borders can function without too high distortions of competition. However, even here no full harmonisation of rules is sought and tax rates are determined at national level, subject to a commonly agreed Community-wide minimum standard rate (15%) and an agreed list of goods of services to which Member States are allowed to apply optional reduced rates. The Commission's policy is laid down in two Communications: "A Strategy to improve the operation of the VAT System within the context of the Internal Market"<a href="#defann_68_4" name="refann_68_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and "Review and update of VAT strategy priorities"<a href="#defann_68_5" name="refann_68_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is of the opinion that environmental policy making should be based on robust scientific knowledge. In the field of climate change this is one of the reasons that the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) was set up. The IPCC assesses on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>At the EU-US summit on 20 June, the President of the Commission stated that differences between the EU and the United States on the Kyoto Protocol should not prevent both sides from looking forward and that, together, the international community needs to intensify its efforts to reach agreement on a multilateral climate change regime for the period after 2012.</p>
<p>The Commission communication “Winning the Battle against Global Climate Change” of 9 February 2005 sets out the Commission’s views on the key elements of such regime. The Communication also shows that the approach advocated by the United States of stimulating research into new technologies is not sufficient by itself.

<p>(EN)Since June 2004, the Commission has been working to resume the formal negotiations as soon as possible and, to that end, Vice-President Barrot visited Washington on 21-22 March 2005 to meet with United States (US) Transportation Secretary Mineta and others in the US Administration and industry. Vice-President Barrot and Secretary Mineta issued a Joint Statement in which they agreed that the negotiators would “review further the possible elements of a US-EU air services agreement with the goal of establishing a solid basis on which formal negotiations can be resumed”.</p>
<p>The Commission has been actively working with the United States through a number of technical discussions to explore the scope for making progress on issues of importance to each side. Discussion has focused in particular on the three areas of regulatory co-operation identified in the Presidency’s conclusions of the 21 April Transport Council: aviation security, competition and government subsidies. Issues of market access and ownership and control have also been discussed. Good progress has been made towards establishing the parameters in order to allow the resumption of negotiations.</p>
<p>In the light of these technical discussions, the Commission reported to the Transport Council on 27/28 June 2005 and there was an exchange of views between the Ministers. In the meantime, it was agreed at the EU-US Summit on 20 June 2005 that the two sides should continue cooperation on aviation issues, including safety, security and liberalization, including achievement of a comprehensive first-step EU-US air services agreement as soon as possible. It was recognised that such an agreement would unlock substantial benefits by providing valuable new business opportunities, to the benefit of EU and US airlines, airports, tourism, business links, cargo transport and consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0514"></a>

<p>A draft report has already been prepared at working level and examined at the level of the competent Member of the Commission. It is foreseen that the Commission should use the opportunity of the report to communicate to the Parliament and to the Council what kind of action could be taken in order to support and to strengthen the contribution of the civil society in the area concerned. The results of the ongoing reflections will be presented as soon as possible after the summer break. Furthermore, the enlargement of the Union in May 2004 had to be taken into account. Funding for a follow-up-project was granted in 2004 under the AGIS programme in order to extend the study to the 10 new Member States.<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission welcomes any appropriate contribution of civil society in finding or supporting missing or sexually exploited persons of all ages. With regard to further studies the input of relevant civil society organisations seems to be indispensable. Initiatives for studies of civil society organisations could be looked at favourably, for instance with regard to children, young people and women in the context of the Daphne II Programme.</p>
<p>As the Commission pointed out in its answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-1498_EN.html">E-1498/05</a> by Mr Richard Corbett, particular attention must be paid to the fact that the possibility of searching for missing people and children in particular already exists under the Schengen Information System (SIS) and will be maintained with the development of the second generation of the SIS. The Commission will also launch a feasibility study on the possibility of creating a new category of alerts on minors which should be banned to leave the Schengen Area, the objective being to prevent an abduction of the minor that would end in a third country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The honourable Member describes the situation of employees of the Carrefour supermarket chain, who are obliged to be on call at their place of work without that on-call time being considered working time.</p>
<p>Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/88/CE<a href="#defann_76_1" name="refann_76_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> defines ‘working time’ as ‘any period during which the worker is working, at the employer’s disposal and carrying out his activities or duties in accordance with national laws and/or practice’.</p>
<p>In order to qualify as working time, within the meaning of the directive, all periods must fulfil the three criteria of the above definition.</p>
<p>In its ruling on the SIMAP<a href="#defann_76_2" name="refann_76_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> case, the Court of Justice stated that ‘the fact that doctors are obliged to be present and available at the workplace with a view to providing their professional services means that they are carrying out their duties’ (point 48) and concluded that ‘time spent on call by doctors … if they are required to be present in the health centre, must be regarded in its entirety as working time’.</p>
<p>According to 2003/88/EC, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, on-call time as described in the honourable Member’s question must therefore be regarded in its entirety as working time. It is for the relevant national authorities to ensure compliance with Community law at national level.</p>
<p>If the amended proposal of 31 May 2005<a href="#defann_76_3" name="refann_76_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> is adopted by Parliament and the Council, active on-call periods must in their entirety be regarded as working time. The inactive part of on-call time would not be regarded as working time, but could no longer form part of the calculation of daily and weekly rest time.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that this amended proposal strikes the right balance between the need to protect employees’ health and safety and the need to offer Member States and EU businesses the necessary flexibility in the organisation of working time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)On the basis of the Act of Accession (annex 4, chapter 4 paragraph 2) and according to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 60/2004<a href="#defann_77_2" name="refann_77_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the surplus sugar quantities for the new Member States were determined by Commission Regulation (EC) No 832/2005<a href="#defann_77_3" name="refann_77_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Act of Accession was signed in April 2003, i.e. 9 months before the publication of Regulation 60/2004. The risks of speculative stock-piling were identified and discussed already during the accession talks with the then candidate countries, especially with those where there was no sugar production and low import protection was applied. Consequently the Commission had the necessary legal and political basis to take this decision.</p>
<p>In the first place the determined quantities should be eliminated from the Community market according to Article 6(2) of Regulation 60/2004 by 30 November 2005. The charges foreseen are only payable if elimination of the determined surplus does not take place appropriately by the set deadline. Attention has to be drawn to the fact that the potential financial burden can be significantly reduced where speculative operators are traced using the identification system that was requested by Article 6(3) of Regulation 60/2004. However, should there remain any quantity not eliminated and for which no operator can be identified, the charges payable by the NMS can be spread over four years (2006-2009).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement put an end to a three-year long, dreadful civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In this respect Dayton has been successful. Nonetheless, it is widely accepted that the Dayton Peace Agreement and the current constitutional arrangements of Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to be progressively adapted in order to take into account the country’s normalisation and to be able to respond to EU criteria.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0527"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission, in common with the honourable Member, is very keen on the idea of safeguarding cultural and linguistic diversity. In order to do so, however, the Commission is bound by the prerogatives conferred on it by the Treaties and, within that framework, the Commission has launched a series of initiatives.</p>
<p>In July 2003, the Commission adopted an Action Plan entitled ‘Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity – an action plan 2004-2006’, in which it undertakes to pursue 45 European-level measures with a view to creating a more favourable environment for languages.</p>
<p>In its Action Plan, the Commission points out that if we are to promote linguistic diversity, we must actively encourage the teaching and learning of the broadest possible range of languages in schools, universities and adult education centres, including the languages of migrants. The Commission also supports the CLIL/EMILE method, which consists of learning a subject in a foreign language.</p>
<p>The possibility of introducing this method in the Member States’ education systems was recently discussed at a conference on multilingual teaching arranged by the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council. The advantages of this system, such as encouraging greater social cohesion, were highlighted in the Presidency’s position on the subject, which was adopted at the Council meeting of 24 May 2005 (EDUC 69 – 8392/05).</p>
<p>The working group on languages established in the framework of the ‘Education and training 2010’ programme has recommended, among other things, that ‘The provision for teaching regional, minority, migrant and neighbouring languages should be part of mainstream education and training policy’.</p>
<p>Community action in this field is limited to encouraging cooperation between Member States, supporting and supplementing their action, ‘while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity’, as stated in Article 149 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The honourable Member mentions Council Directive 77/486/EEC of 25 July 1977 on the education of the children of migrant workers<a href="#defann_79_2" name="refann_79_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Article 3 of that directive states that Member States shall, in accordance with their national circumstances and legal systems and in cooperation with States of origin, take appropriate measures to promote teaching of the mother tongues of the children of migrant workers. Directive 77/486/EEC is currently undergoing a Commission evaluation so that Member States’ obligations might be defined as precisely as possible and, if need be, appropriate proposals submitted to the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>Within the framework of EU cooperation programmes, some projects are cofinanced by the Commission with a view to promoting linguistic diversity and intercultural dialogue. One such example is the Culture 2000 programme, which encourages intercultural dialogue and exchanges between European and non-European cultures. This aspect is further reinforced in the Commission’s proposal on the Culture 2007 programme.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the future integrated ‘lifelong learning’ programme for 2007-2013, the Commission proposes to fund European networks in the area of language learning and linguistic diversity. This will make it possible, for example, to support schools projects through which CLIL/EMILE-type learning could be developed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission was therefore aware of the recent study mentioned by the Honourable Member and published by the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Science on 8 June 2005.</p>
<p>Already in 2002, the Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices was consulted on the potential toxicity of medical devices containing DEHP plasticized PVC for neonates and adopted an opinion according to which, and in view of the data available at that time, no specific recommendation could be made to limit the use of DEHP in any particular patient group.</p>
<p>The Commission is deeply committed to ensuring that high risk patient groups, and in particular infants in intensive care units, receive proper care and treatment delivered by safe medical devices. For this reason, the Commission convened a meeting of the Expert Group on DEHP-PVC medical devices.</p>
<p>The opinion of the newly established Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks will be sought to evaluate the new data. The June 2005 Harvard study will be one of the documents that will be part of the Committee’s review.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Expert Group, taking into account the opinion of the Scientific Committee and any new technical developments, will propose, as necessary, further actions on the use of DEHP-PVC in medical devices and possible alternatives.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware that the Directive is highly complex and that it affects many enterprises, in particular those that have to comply with differing legislative requirements in various Member States, not least because the Directive is based on Article 175 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>In terms of the legal position on WEEE Directive, the Commission is currently assessing whether the measures notified by the Member States correctly transpose the obligations of the Directive. As the guardian of the Treaty, the Commission does not hesitate to take all necessary measures, including infringement procedures under Article 226 of the Treaty, in order to ensure the observance of Community law.</p>
<p>The Commission has established a structured dialogue and an exchange of views and experience with the Member States in the Directive’s Technical Adaptation Committee as well as with industry stakeholders in numerous bilateral meetings and in addition in the high-level discussion forum that was set up by Directorate-General Environment at the beginning of 2005. The Commission is taking a leading role in harmonising its implementation as far as possible. To this end, a guidance document on the WEEE Directive is available at the Directorate General Environment website: <span class="underline">http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/waste/weee_index.htm</span></p>

<p>On the basis of the information provided by the honourable Member on the Dutch legislation in question, the Commission is of the opinion that this is an allowance that, on the one hand, meets the criteria laid down in the case law of the Court of Justice<a href="#defann_82_3" name="refann_82_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> for being classified as a family benefit within the meaning of Article 4(h) of regulation 1408/71, and that, on the other hand, can also be classified as a social advantage within the meaning of Article 7(2) of Regulation 1612/68.</p>
<p>In order to be in a position to examine all of the legal aspects of the honourable Member’s question, the Commission will contact the Dutch authorities with a view to obtaining further details on this legislation and to examining the impact of Community law on the allowance in question.

<p>Spain is pushing ahead with the AGUA programme, taking a series of measures to boost the supply of water in a country seriously affected by drought. The AGUA programme, which complies with the relevant Community rules, is proving to be highly effective in guaranteeing supplies and respecting the need for minimum flows to maintain the ecosystem in the various river basins. It has thus shown up the shortcomings of other techniques and major hydraulic conduction projects which could have caused irreversible damage to the environment and biodiversity in Spain. Moreover, the new desalination techniques now available make it possible for reverse osmosis to be carried out with a high degree of energy efficiency and the residual brine to be managed in a highly sustainable way.</p>
<p>Many Mediterranean countries in the EU are already using desalination systems, even though they do not have the best available techniques that are already being used in Spain. Will the Commission put forward a recommendation encouraging EU countries which have the possibility of obtaining water through desalination to invest in the installation and modernisation of such systems? What funds can the EU use to provide an incentive for the installation of desalinators in areas where these systems are found to be the most sustainable means of obtaining water?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of a range of existing as well as planned desalination plants, in particular in the Mediterranean countries. Elements of importance seem to be the following ones: environmental aspects; promoting environmental technologies; and use of funding instruments.</p>
<p>Environmental aspects:</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the intention by the Spanish authorities to use desalination plants to supply water to regions with water scarcity. The Commission wishes to use this opportunity to provide some information on the Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_83_1" name="refann_83_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, a cornerstone of the comprehensive European legislation providing for water protection.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive provides for the protection of all our waters; it covers all sectors of human activity; it sets the objective of good quality (‘good status’) for all waters, linked to a non-deterioration clause; it defines ‘good status’ for coastal waters in a comprehensive way, in terms of biological, physico-chemical and hydromorphological quality elements, and it submits all point source discharges liable to cause pollution to an authorisation procedure.</p>
<p>In addition to the Water Framework Directive requirements, there also is a comprehensive framework of criteria to be adhered to under other parts of the EU environmental legislation, in particular the nature protection legislation, and this is in particular in relation to the case of specially protected areas (e.g. fields of Poseidonia along the Spanish coast, specially protected under the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_83_2" name="refann_83_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), ensuring that the environmental objectives will be adhered to.</p>
<p>The Commission has not planned to give a recommendation for specific techniques. However, innovation in general, and eco-innovation or innovation in environmental technologies in particular, is encouraged through the EU Environmental Technologies Action Plan<a href="#defann_83_3" name="refann_83_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. For example, the testing and validation of new technologies, such as new desalination techniques, should be facilitated by the networks of testing centres, being established through the 6th Framework-Programme for Research and Development, and through a potential EU Environmental Technologies Verification system, which the Commission is preparing actively.</p>
<p>Funding instruments:</p>
<p>The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund may be used to co-finance such desalination plants. The Commission will consider, under the light of the Community legislation relating to the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund currently in force, possible co-financing to every project presented by the Spanish authorities, and eventually included in the Programme A.G.U.A. Some Regional Operational Programmes have been specially re-programmed at the beginning of 2005 to allow such a possible co-financing of the Programme A.G.U.A projects, especially desalination plants (new and/or extension of existing ones).</p>
<p>Following the latest information received by the Spanish authorities, there are some 21 desalination plants included, up to the moment, in the A.G.U.A. programme, the large majority of them being in the "project drafting" phase.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission understands and shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members regarding several aspects of the running of the European Schools. It also wishes to reassure the honourable Members that, although the Commission has only one vote out of 29 on the Board of Governors of the European Schools, it strongly defends the interests of institution staff and their children with a view to finding acceptable solutions at the level of the European Schools system. In this context, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its formal opposition to any restrictive policy that might penalise the children of European institution employees for whom these schools were set up,<a href="#defann_89_1" name="refann_89_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> separate siblings from category I families and force very young children to make long journeys across Brussels.</p>
<p>Whilst the Commission cannot be held responsible for any lack of planning, it would also note that it has for a number of years played a central role in measures to support the intake of new pupils until the fourth school in Brussels is ready to be used.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission has lent its support to the European Schools’ Secretary General and has managed to obtain two buildings from the Belgian authorities (the BASF building as an annexe of the Brussels I School and the HP building as an annexe of the Brussels II School) for the European Schools’ use by September 2005 at the latest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in February 2004, the Commission proposed the emergency measure of immediately suspending any new intake of category III pupils in the Brussels and Luxembourg European Schools, to pre-empt possible overcrowding.</p>
<p>Neither of these proposals received the support needed in order to be implemented.</p>
<p>The Commission remains opposed to the restrictive policy pursued by the Secretary General of the European Schools, to the separation of category I siblings and, in particular, to the decision to limit certain language groups from the Brussels II and III schools to one pre-school class.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission has written to the Secretary General of the European Schools asking him expressly to ask the Board of Governors in writing to reopen by September 2005 the pre-school classes that had been closed and to accept the intake of children of European institution employees.</p>
<p>Moreover, the findings of the consultation on options for developing the European Schools system<a href="#defann_89_2" name="refann_89_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, launched by the Commission in July 2004, will enable it, as from 2006, to draw up more specific proposals for favourable development or key reform of the European Schools system, in order to respond to the challenges facing these schools from the point of view of education, governance and funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission would remind the honourable Member that, under the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools,<a href="#defann_90_1" name="refann_90_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the responsibility of these schools is guaranteed by the board of Governors, the intergovernmental body made up of representatives of each of the Member States on which the Commission only has one vote out of 29, despite its significant financial contribution (around 60% of the European Schools’ budget).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the policy drawn up by the Board of Governors lays down a maximum of 32 pupils per class; more than 32 pupils, and a new class is set up. The limit set for all classes and all levels is towards the upper end of common practice in the various EU Member States and is scrupulously adhered to by the schools.</p>
<p>Classes sometimes have more than 30 pupils, irrespective of language group, particularly in the large schools in Brussels and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member says, the Commission proposed a reduction in class sizes in its Communication on options for developing the European Schools system,<a href="#defann_90_2" name="refann_90_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> particularly given that they often have pupils that do not have their own language group and who therefore require special support to work in a language that is not their mother tongue.<a href="#defann_90_3" name="refann_90_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>Having analysed the responses to the ongoing consultation process, which has dispelled any doubts on the subject, it will explain its position in one of the forthcoming meetings of the Board of Governors.

<p>(EN)With regard to the implementation of the reform, the following flexibility is available: Member States may decide to increase the minimum decoupling rate of 40%, set objective criteria with regard to the distribution of coupled support and, if duly justified, introduce a differentiation of the decoupling rate by region.</p>
<p>Granting of the aid will not be based on the ownership of tobacco quota at 15 May 2004. In general, decoupled support is based on the tobacco premium payments received during the reference period 2000-2002. During the period 2006-2009 coupled aid shall be granted to farmers who received tobacco premium payments during the period 2000-2002 and to those who acquired tobacco production quotas during the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2005.</p>
<p>The Council has decided that, as of budget year 2011, an amount of € 484 million shall be available annually as additional Community support for restructuring measures in tobacco producing regions under rural development programming.</p>
<p>In its 2004 reform, the Council did not strive for the disappearance of tobacco growing in the EU. After 2009, tobacco growers will continue to receive decoupled support and will be able to carry on growing tobacco or produce other crops. Concerning alternative crops, the Community Tobacco Fund finances studies into the possibilities for raw tobacco producers of switching to other crops or activities and actions of general interest. In the EU, since 2003, 51 such studies and actions have commenced of which 4 in Spain.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0552"></a>

<p>(FR)Following Decision No 884/2004/EC<a href="#defann_93_1" name="refann_93_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the trans-European transport network (TENs), the Commission has prioritised the 30 projects of European interest identified by Parliament and the Council, such as those listed in Annex III of the Decision. Priority projects such as project No 3 (South-west Europe high-speed rail link) and project No 16 (freight rail link Sines/Algeciras – Madrid – Paris) are intended to develop a series of major rail infrastructures in the Pyrenees that will play a key role in restoring the balance of modes of transport in a transport hub faced with a huge increase in road traffic. The decision taken by Parliament and the Council concerning the latter project provides for a possible new high-capacity rail link across the Pyrenees, albeit without specifying its route and the completion date.</p>
<p>The ‘axis’ that stems from the FERRMED initiative does not appear on the list of priority projects. This initiative, which is based on the trans-European Rail Freight Network opened up to competition by Directive 2001/12/CE<a href="#defann_93_2" name="refann_93_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, is intended to develop rail freight on various sections of the trans-European network, some of which are also stretches used by priority projects.

<p>The process of updating Decision No 884/2004/EC stipulates that the Commission draw up a state of play report on the work by 2010 and, where necessary, proposes changes to the list of priority projects listed in Annex III. The Commission wishes to take this opportunity to point out that carrying out the 30 projects alone will require considerable investment and a substantially increased budget for the trans-European networks. It therefore does not consider it desirable at this stage to plan new projects and, accordingly, does not intend to propose any changes to Decision No 884/2004/EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
