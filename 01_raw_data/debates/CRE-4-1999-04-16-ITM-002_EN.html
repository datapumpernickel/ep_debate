<p class="contents">The Rules do not allow two committees to be responsible for the same matter. Therefore, in order to ensure that the text approved is consistent, responsibility for the legal protection of consumers should be given to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights.</p>

I must admit that I am surprised at the way in which we automatically look for legal arguments in order to oppose a particular group of Members.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, a tenth of the Members of Parliament are involved, that is, 66 Members from all the political groups: 5 from the PSE Group, 8 from the PPE Group, 4 from the ELDR Group, 6 from the UPE Group, 6 from the GUE/NGL Group, 9 from the Green Group, 3 from the ARE Group, 15 from the I‐EDN Group, and 10 Non‐attached Members. This is therefore not something that has been initiated by any particular Member, but by a tenth of the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter had been referred to the Legal Service on 6 April. In a memorandum of 7 April, which was sent to Mr Priestley, our legal expert concluded that a motion of censure against the Commission could be declared admissible in order to clarify the Commission"s legal situation and to further limit its powers, despite the fact that this would provide very little added value in legal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The resigning Commission will remain in office until at least the end of September or the start of October. It retains all its powers because it has resigned in the context of Article 159. Thus, Mrs Bonino, a resigning Commissioner, visited the headquarters of NATO, an international organisation, to meet its Secretary‐General for the first time. Was such a decision taken in the context of a Commission which is dealing with current business?</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot therefore accept a situation where the Commission retains all its powers for more than six months following its resignation but yet you yourself are unable to exercise your fundamental right to assert control over it, particularly through the motion of censure.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I feel that the decision you are taking, Mr President, is extremely serious in light of the present situation – although that is not so serious – and in terms of its implications for the future of this House and the future of democracy in Europe.</p>

We have the opinion of Parliament"s legal adviser, amongst other things on the matter of current affairs, and that opinion contains some important points on the question now at issue. The legal adviser says of the Commission"s current position: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) ‘It appears that a collective resignation of all the Members of the Commission because they no longer have the confidence of Parliament is best provided for in Article 144 of the Treaty, which relates to a motion of censure tabled by Parliament. The motion of censure is an expression of the principle of parliamentary confidence. This was strengthened in the Maastricht Treaty through rules ensuring that the parliamentary term and the Commission"s period in office run in parallel, and by allowing Parliament to approve the appointment of the Commission and its President. That being the case, even if a direct comparison with the motion of censure does not appear to be indicated, the desire to seek solutions that are in keeping with this principle of parliamentary confidence seems to conform to the spirit of the Treaty. It follows that the Commission"s situation at present is similar to that referred to in Article 144 of the Treaty."</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) So your decision, Mr President, is absolutely correct and entirely in accordance with the Treaty. The motion of censure is therefore inadmissible.</span></p>

But the point surely is a moral one. This Commission resigned more than two months ago, yet it is still in office, it is still drawing its salaries, it is still making decisions and it is still <span class="italic">not</span> making decisions. Europe is in a crisis, and this Parliament has an obligation to say to them: get an interim Commission appointed quickly. It they do not, I recommend all Members to reject Mr Prodi in May as a sign of objection to this situation. We are going to hold elections in two months time. The citizens of Europe do not understand why a Commission, which resigned two months ago, is going to continue for another nine months. It is a disgrace and we should say so!</p>

I think that we have had enough debate on this issue and I would like to tell those responsible for the motion of censure that I consider it to be inadmissible.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports by the Legal Service must be studied carefully, but they are not binding on the President in terms of how the Rules are to be interpreted. The President is responsible for all interpretations of the Rules of Procedure and only the Committee on the Rules of Procedure can alter any interpretation by the President. I can assure you that, in taking this decision, I have given every consideration to my responsibilities now and for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the motion of censure, under parliamentary law, is to demonstrate that an executive has lost the confidence of the majority of Parliament or, if the motion is rejected, that it still has that confidence. It is clear that in this case the possible rejection of a motion of censure could in no way have the effect of restoring confidence in the executive, and it would serve no purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">This procedure therefore seems somewhat ridiculous, and we must always reject any form of ridiculous interpretation concerning one of our Rules, particularly in the case of a motion of censure, which is a highly political instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I respect all the signatories to the motion, as I respect all the Members of this House, but it is our responsibility to use the appropriate channels in this matter, that is the Court of Justice or the relevant resolutions, since the Rules allow us to express our wishes in many forms.</p>
<p class="contents">A motion of censure is not the appropriate channel, and this House is not responsible for the fact that the Commission is going to continue in office for many months. We have offered to cooperate with the Council in order to replace the Commission as soon as possible. We could not have done anything further, and it is not our responsibility if the Council has decided that for various reasons it still cannot appoint a new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done what we can until now, and indeed we must continue to acknowledge our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter is therefore settled.</p>

I have two roles: firstly as the original author of the document which sought to change committee structures and, secondly, as chairman of the committee responsible at the moment for consumer policy. At the end of the Conference of Presidents' meeting yesterday, I spoke with Mr Rømer and other officials. The position is that the legal protection of consumers will be the responsibility of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. However, consumer rights as such, and consumer policy in so far as it affects, for example, food safety and the like, will continue to be the responsibility of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. That is the clarified explanation and, as far as I am aware, that is the situation that was accepted by senior officials in Parliament. I think that is perfectly reasonable. The point is that we really had to adopt Annex VI, to avoid the conflicts of competence which have sometimes caused so much trouble in the last five or ten years, and the explanation I have just given avoids such conflicts.</p>

Why? Because Amendment No 31 states that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is responsible for consumers' legal protection. There is a clear contradiction. The legal protection of consumers' rights should remain the responsibility of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and consumers' rights should remain the responsibility of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, as Mr Collins has just explained.</p>

Mr President, I think you need to find out what we voted on first.</p>

As far as I am aware, the amendment by the Group of the Party of European Socialists was voted on initially. The PPE Group"s amendment could therefore not have been adopted, as it would have contradicted the result of a previous amendment. The system we use allows us to clarify the matter, with the result that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection will continue to have the responsibilities that correspond to it, just as the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights will continue to have the responsibilities it ought to have. In my view, therefore, this is the only possible outcome, given what has happened. We have no option but to keep things as they are. This matter is thus settled.</p>

I only wish to draw attention to the two amendments tabled by our group on the question of carry‐overs, where the texts are incompatible in their present form. They were rejected. These amendments are based on the current Rules of Procedure, and we have now adopted a resolution that is at odds with the existing Rules of Procedure, according to which the Committee on Budgets is responsible for transfers of appropriations from the reserve, while all other carry‐overs – and I am generalising somewhat here – are the responsibility of the Committee on Budgetary Control. May I ask you to check that, because we undoubtedly have a contradiction here. That is why I tabled these amendments on behalf of my group. I cannot tell you the numbers of the two amendments offhand, but that can easily be checked.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Provan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to refer back to the matter of the responsibilities of committees. It is very important that Parliament is clear about the different responsibilities of committees. Otherwise, the general public's understanding of the European Community will become more confused. They will see the Parliament adopt different positions in different committees. Therefore, clarification of responsibilities is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I respect the decision you have made and I understand very clearly what Mr Collins said. But in the future we have to make sure that this Parliament, if it is going to change the responsibilities of a committee, does it by a clear majority. If there is no provision for this at present, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities should look at it, as Mr Herman has already suggested. There should be a clear majority in the House for a change of responsibilities, not just a small margin, especially when, as at present, we have said two different things in two different amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the House to recommend to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure that an overall majority is needed to change the responsibilities of committees.</p>

Perhaps there is a mistake in the Minutes, although it says that Amendments Nos 60 and 61 were rejected and Amendment No 31 by the Socialist Group was adopted.
