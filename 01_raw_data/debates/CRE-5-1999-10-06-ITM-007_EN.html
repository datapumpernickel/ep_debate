Climate policy is one of the greatest of all the environmental challenges that exist on a global basis, and I believe that it will continue to be so throughout the next century. Climate change will have immense social and economic effects. Obviously, the more we allow the climate to change, the greater these effects will be.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that people are just becoming aware of is the likely effects of climate change on health. Many researchers believe that the increase in the number of storms and flooding are a sign that the climate is changing. Obviously, these have a direct effect on people’s health. But still more significant are the indirect effects of climate change that stem from changes in the ecosystem. It is predicted that, for example, warmer and drier summers in many areas will mean smaller harvests. It is also predicted that, as a result of warmer climates, many diseases spread by what are known as vectors, such as those spread by insects, will increase. It is predicted, for example, that malaria may spread to southern parts of Europe and the United States. Ultimately we could also have a situation where a new type of gap emerges between rich and poor: the health gap. This is just one example of the dramatic effects that climate change could bring with it. For that reason, it is vital that we prevent, or at least slow down, climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that was made in Kyoto is an important step forward, but one that does not go nearly far enough. It is important to realise that beyond the commitments of Kyoto, new commitments have to be made in order to sufficiently slow down climate change. But in spite of that, achieving the commitments made at Kyoto will take a lot of effort and a significant change to the way the problem has been dealt with up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s action consists of two main areas. One is the Union’s own action to reduce emissions, and the other is the work of the Union in international negotiations. The Union’s own action and the action taken in the Member States at national level to reduce emissions are essential in order to maintain the international dimension. It is worrying that, according to a report by the European Environmental Agency, the ‘business as usual’ attitude will lead to an increase in emissions in the Union and not the reduction of 8% by the year 2010, to which we are committed. This means that new policy action is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important objectives of the Finnish presidential term is to achieve first sector strategies for energy, transport and agriculture. Without such strategies it will not be possible to achieve the reductions in emissions we are committed to. I believe it is important that a continuous process should emerge from these sector strategies, i.e. that we should not be content with the first versions but that at regular intervals sector strategies in the areas of transport and energy, for example, should be reviewed and targets should be set that are ever more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, what is most important in international talks is to resolve issues that are still open, enabling us to start to ratify the Kyoto Protocol so that it may come into effect and become binding. It is Finland’s objective at the Fifth Party Summit at Bonn to make decisive progress in the creation of rules relating to the Kyoto mechanisms and rules for monitoring the agreement. Our aim is that, ideally, the Fifth Party Summit should produce a draft agreement, which will obviously have sluice-gates in it, but which will enable us to adhere to a timetable, thus making it possible to conclude the agreement at the Sixth Party Summit, meaning that progress in the Party Summit this autumn is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most difficult issues is the main role played by the less developed and the industrialised countries. As the country holding the Presidency, Finland will also work to ensure that climate policy and development policy support one another. We also have in the Development Council conclusions being drafted on the connection between climate policy and development policy. It is important to bring technology, for example, to the less developed nations. The most important mechanism here will be the Clean Development Mechanism. So that the transfer of technology and resources to the less developed countries can start to work we need rules for the CDM. But it is also important for the Union that the agreement on all three of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms – the CDM, International Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation – make equal progress under the agreement. The 50% ceiling proposed by the Union for the use of the mechanisms has attracted harsh criticism from other negotiating parties to the agreement, which means that this will be a very difficult issue in international talks. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Commission’s communication on preparations for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is a lucid document and a good start, but it mainly contains measures for the initial stage. It will also be essential to draw up a longer-term programme.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It did the same when the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. It is my ambition to ensure that the EU retains this leading role in combating climate change. The European Parliament has already had an important role to play in taking this work forward. I also welcome the resolution which has been presented here today. </p>
<p class="contents">The political challenge is enormous. Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is still not within reach. A lot of rich countries with unacceptably high emissions of greenhouse gases are hesitating. What is more, the highest increases in emissions during the next two decades will take place in the developing countries. Within the EU, too, the trend is in the wrong direction. Emissions have increased dramatically in recent years, especially within the transport sector. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the EU is expected to be able to stabilise its emissions of greenhouse gases at the 1990 level by the year 2000, but that is not enough. If we continue as we are today, we shall not be able to honour our Kyoto commitment to reduce emissions by 8% over the period 2008 to 2012. The trend is not good, whether in terms of sustainable development or the EU’s international credibility. How are we going to meet this challenge?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I have already stated during the European Parliament’s hearings, combating climate change is one of my most important priorities. I shall be proposing the measures required to achieve results in this area. Allow me to outline now what, in my view, are three essential components of an effective and comprehensive climate change strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: if we are to be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we need to adopt a strategy which includes concrete measures in different areas. A number of sectors and interests must be involved in this work. In order to achieve this, I shall be launching an action programme to combat climate change at the beginning of next year. My idea is to bring together all those concerned: technical experts, representatives of business, non-governmental organisations and other important players. The object, of course, is to reap the benefits of cooperation and to try to reach a consensus on practical measures which the Commission can propose to the Council and Parliament. A programme of this kind may form the basis for further measures. An important part of these measures will be to spread knowledge and make better use of the enormous advantages which new technology offers. Great capacity exists in the form of renewable energy sources, new vehicle technology, energy-efficient equipment and machinery which is waiting to get onto the market. Up until now, we have not been using this potential sufficiently. We must alert private individuals and business to the fact that this new technology, in many cases, also holds out the prospect of financial gain. The market for these technological solutions must be extended through the introduction on our part of a mixture of clear rules and financial incentives. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: I intend, during the spring of 2000, to present a Green Paper on the trade in emission rights within the EU. I am aware of the fact that there are still hesitations when it comes to using so-called flexible mechanisms. I am nonetheless convinced that, if they are regulated as part of a system with clear and effective conditions, such mechanisms will contribute to our being able, in a cost-effective way, to achieve the reductions in emissions which we need. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: in addition to these measures, we must also implement changes in areas which influence emissions of greenhouse gases but which lie outside the range of environmental policy. I am thinking mainly of sectors such as the energy, transportation and industrial sectors. We must therefore make sure that the integration strategy which was adopted in Cardiff in June 1998 produces results. The discussions which are to take place in connection with the Summit in Helsinki in December will in many ways decide how these sectors might contribute to combating climate change. </p>
<p class="contents">Many people say that this will take time. That is quite true, but it is also a good reason for taking measures right now. We can see positive developments in certain areas. I am thinking, for example, of the efforts which Mr Bolkestein, has made to remove obstacles to the negotiations concerning the proposed energy tax. It is clear, however, that if certain Member States, in the future too, oppose this proposal, we shall have to find alternatives. I note that the European Parliament is in fact in favour of using the flexibility clause in the Amsterdam Treaty. This clause in fact enables a number of Member States to move forward in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Questions relating to transportation and energy are also of decisive importance for the combating of climate change. I shall therefore be discussing with Mrs Loyola de Palacio how to reach the goal of doubling the use of renewable energy sources and also improving energy efficiency. We shall also be discussing how we are going to be able to reduce emissions from the transport sector. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will shortly be adopting new guidelines in connection with State support aimed at protecting the environment. Mario Monti is investigating the ways in which subsidies and tax incentives can contribute to an improved environment and to protecting our climate. I shall also be investigating whether the support for fossil fuels might be redirected to the use of renewable energy sources and implementation of energy-saving measures. </p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to urge the European Parliament to determine what Parliament can do through its own work to ensure that these questions about climate change are taken into account in different sectors of the economy. We need your full support in order to achieve rapid results in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that I fully share Parliament’s view that we must all provide intelligible and easily accessible information to make it easier for citizens of the European Union to play an active role in this work. It is only when each and every one of us takes his or her own share of responsibility for climate change that we are going to see results. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures I have just reported on will help give Europe the credibility required for us to be able to continue to fight for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This ought to be ratified as soon as possible after the Sixth Party Summit to the UN’s framework convention on climate change. If we are to succeed in our efforts, it will of course also be necessary for the Member States to participate fully and to live up to their commitments. Mr Hassi has already spoken about the forthcoming international negotiations at the Fifth Party Summit. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I also emphasise the decisive role which the EU plays as a bridge between the USA and developing countries, making sure that all are fully involved in the process and live up to their commitments. I am counting on your wholehearted support and look forward to close collaboration with Parliament with a view to achieving results. It is our joint responsibility to succeed, and on behalf of future generations too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The building is a monument to how humankind has ignored the imperatives of climate change. There is no natural light at all and we demand huge amounts of electricity. Even when we get into the lifts they are black so we have to have the electric light on. However, that being said, I welcome the remarks by the President-in-Office and by the Commissioner and, if I may do so in my humble position, I would like to congratulate her on her maiden speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto Protocol created certain expectations and the impression of the European Parliament is that things have been allowed to go to sleep for far too long after the negotiations on that protocol were concluded. Politicians have partly conspired to hide from the peoples of our Member States that implementing the Kyoto Protocols is going to be painful. It is going to cost them money. It is going to be money well spent, because we need to spend it to protect the environment, but it is going to cost them money.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Wallström for outlining to us what the Commission’s action is going to be. She said at one point, rather blandly I thought, that she was going to propose tangible measures in various sectors. Well, we wait to see what these are going to be. We are glad there is going to be an action programme coming forward in the spring and a Green Paper on emissions trading. When we had our debate in the hearing with the Commissioner about a month or so ago, my committee, the Committee on the Environment, was really rather in two minds as to whether it wanted to see emissions trading measures put forward, but it is worth our while to explore that line.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to produce an action programme to enable the European Union to live up to what it signed up to in Kyoto. We would like to highlight – and we have highlighted in our resolution – the need for action, particularly in the air transport sector. That is not something which can be left to the transport Commissioner, it is an initiative that should come from Mrs Wallström.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lange (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to make two observations as well as two requests. The first is about emissions trading. Emissions trading has two sides, one is political and the other economic. In political terms, there are different ways of evaluating emissions trading. Many in our group take the view that emissions trading, i.e. the freedom to buy the obligation to reduce CO2, is not politically tenable. I do not want to evaluate that further now, but I think that the reduction of CO2 should not be seen merely as a burden but that it actually has an economic effect, and offers the opportunity, and the possibility, to bring the improvement of the quality of life into line with employment. That is why I feel that we should not participate in unlimited emissions trading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that Parliament’s position, which we drafted – to permit at the most 50% emissions trading, that is, 50% reduction of CO2 must be done in one’s own country – is in political and also economic terms, exactly the right way to generate employment here at home. There is a sufficient number of studies which show that, for example, a reduction by 34,000 carbon equivalent units creates around 100 jobs in Europe, and this is the route we should take in order to bring ecology and economics designed to increase employment more in line with one another. Hence my request: could you please confirm that you do not support any agreement which allows more than 50% emissions trading to take place outside one’s own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the European Parliament’s participation. I was very pleased Mrs Wallström, that you emphasised once again your desire to work closely with the European Parliament and I fully accept what you say. Past experience has shown, though, that this was sometimes not the case and that participation indeed worked on a very ad hoc basis. This occurred firstly in the delegations for example, where one sometimes had the impression that the European Commission did the actual negotiating there, and that the Members of Parliament who were also present, were just there to make up the numbers. It also occurred in the drafting of the mandate or, to give a particularly negative example, in the issue of individual obligations to reduce CO2 and their negotiation by the Commission with the relevant partners, especially recently with the Japanese and Korean car manufacturers. In this case, there was absolutely no contact with the European Parliament and the Parliament was not even officially informed. The Council on the other hand, was informed and will make its decision on this on 12 October, but we have been cut out of the loop. If we want to establish an instrument for individual obligation, then please ensure that all partners participate. This brings me on to my second request: could you please confirm that a modus vivendi for the participation of Parliament will be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is really good to hear that Mrs Wallström has ambitions for the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are today in a position where ever more people recognise that it is the interplay between environment and economies and between environment and markets in which a large part of the solution to our problems lies. We must therefore make more and more use of economic instruments of control. We take this up in our resolution. Commissioner Wallström has also touched upon the question. The fact is that each country is free to introduce this type of measure, as in fact a number of countries have done already. The best thing, however, would be for all countries to do this at the same time. The next best thing would be for all EU Member States to do it at the same time. A less good, but nonetheless necessary, alternative would perhaps be for some country to take the lead, that is to say for the flexibility clause to be used. In that case, the majority of countries could move to introduce the measures required, while the others remained shamefully behind. I had intended to ask Commissioner Wallström a question about this. I do not, however, need to do this now because she has backed this point of view right from the beginning. The question is merely one of how many countries we can get to join us in a first phase of this kind. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to raise is precisely the point that Mr Lange raised in the matter of trade in emission rights. I believe it is necessary to make for the greatest possible effectiveness at the lowest possible cost. It is good that we should now be getting a Green Paper on this subject. I am also pleased that Commissioner Wallström, with the background she has, has adopted the standpoint she has done. I think it would be unfortunate to land ourselves today with percentage figures concerning the extent to which a particular environmental measure is to be employed. I believe that we should be prepared to work as quickly and effectively as possible to influence the environment for the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament must give you both its fullest support in your aim to include the issue of climate change in all European Union policy. We know that very far-reaching decisions will be made at the Helsinki Summit on how to take account of environmental considerations generally, and climatic issues in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström spoke of a very positive matter with regard to Mr Monti. The Member of the Commission responsible for issues of competition is thus ready to look into how subsidies and taxes will impact on climatic issues. Parliament’s draft statement forcefully emphasises the importance of reducing those very large subsidies that are granted at present for fossil fuels. I believe that Mr Monti will tackle this problem in earnest. Perhaps we could then redirect the subsidies to areas that further the Union’s intentions, especially that of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the idea that we must try hard to ensure that market forces work to halt the development of climate change. In this, the importance of an energy tax cannot be underestimated. The Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market, Mr Bolkestein, told Parliament yesterday that he also intends to become involved in this issue, although, unfortunately, he said he still needed a year to convince Spain that an energy tax is really needed. I would have been interested to hear the opinions of the Member of the Commission and the President-in-Office on how a common energy tax would evolve, as, without one, the European Union will be unable to fulfil its objectives.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What makes it so difficult is that, if we are to take the matter seriously, huge changes must be made in both the energy and transport sectors. What is probably also required, in spite of new technology and alternative energy sources, is less use of transport and lower energy consumption overall. </p>
<p class="contents">A large part of the responsibility for this lies, of course, with the individual Member States, but the EU too can do a great deal. My Group naturally supports this resolution which we have also been involved in drafting. I shall emphasise three points which are especially important for the EU in this situation. </p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that we must come up with a carbon dioxide levy, that is to say, a tax on greenhouse gases. I should like to emphasise what is stated in paragraph 15 of the resolution to the effect that it is probably better to have a decision of substance, even if we do not have everyone on board, than to have a decision lacking in substance which entails an unacceptable delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the subsidy for fossil fuels which is, of course, directly counter-productive. I also think that the EU’s energy research grants must focus solely on renewable sources of energy, which is not the case at present. </p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns aviation fuel. It is a matter of urgency that agreement be reached on the international taxation of aviation fuel. Aviation is the area with the fastest increase in emissions of greenhouse gases. On this subject, I should like to hear a little more from Commissioner Wallström. What do you intend to do with regard to this particular area? What initiatives do you have under way? </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to point out that there is a lot of scepticism in my group about trade in emission rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A conference on climate change is just around the corner now. It is to take place in Bonn.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that there are so many different opinions about climate change, there are bound to be a great many more conferences in the future. The fact is that there has been no noticeable improvement whatsoever. According to a report by IPCC, there will need to be a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions between now and 2010 if temperatures and the rise in sea level are to be kept within the necessary limits. This does not sit well with the fact that in most EU countries CO2 concentrations have done nothing but rise since 1990. So we will need drastic supplementary measures if we are to comply with the Kyoto Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it has become apparent since this agreement was reached that countries are taking their time when it comes to compliance. It is downright scandalous that the Member States have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol. This severely restricts the foundation on which practical efforts to cut down greenhouse gases are to be based. It would in any case be best if Member State Governments were to press on with ratification. In view of the seriousness of the situation I support the proposal made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Lange to do this by means of an assent procedure. Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is not, in fact, something Parliament has to do, but neither can we allow a situation to develop in which laxness on the part of the Member States means there is no ratification whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is that there must soon be clarity and agreement in relation to the criteria for flexible mechanisms. However, we must also guard against wanting other countries to effect reductions when we do not take measures to limit CO2 emissions ourselves.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we add that up over the course of a year, we are actually moving backwards in one go, at a rate of one million years per year. In this sense, the plans of the Council and the Commission do not of course go far enough by any means and are actually merely cosmetic actions. What we need in the long term are not voluntary agreements, but thorough analyses of the real costs and to make the whole tax system environmentally friendly. If these things are not done, it simply will not work! </p>

There are ever more signs to indicate that imminent climate changes on our planet will become the really big environmental question and challenge for politicians the world over. </p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I should like to report on the positions we have adopted. We oppose paragraph 15 because we are doubtful as to the suitability and effectiveness of general energy taxes. We oppose paragraph 16. The question of energy efficiency is in fact also dealt with in paragraph 11 in the motion for a resolution. It is proposed in paragraph 11 that a directive be prepared for this area and, in so doing, consideration can be given to what might be a more realistic goal for increased energy efficiency than what is stated in paragraph 16. </p>
<p class="contents">Where the draft amendments are concerned, we support proposal 1 from Mr Bowis, who is a member of the Group of the European People’s Party, together with draft Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists. With regard to proposal 4 from the Socialists, we request split voting because we think that it would be unrealistic to try to achieve ratification of the protocol as early as the first few months of next year, even if it were a matter of urgency. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to paragraph 5 from the Greens, we request split voting there as well. We share the view that an EU Directive on renewable energy sources ought to be prepared, but we think that decisions about targets which are to be legally binding upon the Member States ought not to be formulated by the EU organisation. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally: I listened this morning to Environmental Commissioner Wallström who is in fact also with us here now. She emphasised that market forces, free trade and well-informed consumers can be our best friends in obtaining a sound environment.

They must both be seen as part of the greater whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The current trend in all the Western societies of the European Union and throughout humanity is in irreconcilable conflict with the economics of nature. We speak of sustainable development with reference to the economics of nature, but the main drift of the action goes in the opposite direction. Despite the population policy, population growth continues at a considerable rate. Everywhere, including the most prosperous countries in the world, people are trying to raise their material standard of living, which is to say, they consume more.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many who believe that the invisible hands at work in the markets and technological development will solve the problems of mankind. Market forces are a good servant, but a bad master. The new technology will help us to adapt our own economy to that of nature, but it also creates new problems and risks all the time. Both market forces and technological developments must be steered in a direction that will take sustainable development from the sphere of mere words to one of deeds. </p>
<p class="contents">In the end, however, it will be a question of the values of life and policy.

<p class="contents">Really, I would like to concentrate on the points which are of most concern to this Parliament. Firstly, the European Union must continue to lead the way at the meeting which will take place in Bonn from the 25th of the month and, if necessary, it would be very useful to suggest a unilateral reduction, which was initially envisaged as 15%. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also feel that it is essential that the Kyoto Protocol be ratified. I think that it is scandalous that 84 countries signed it and yet only 12, mostly small islands, have ratified it. Perhaps these small islands have done so because the danger is much closer to home for them. The European Union therefore, must make efforts to ensure that its Member Countries also sign this protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very keen on emphasising the issue raised by Commissioner Wallström, regarding a concrete plan of action. I think that the time has arrived, Commissioner and Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to abandon rhetoric and to take action. If you abandon rhetoric and take action, this Parliament will certainly support you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I ask her with my amendment to do one thing more. We all want to see greenhouse gas emissions reduced and my amendment is not a judgment on energy taxes, but it is seeking to help us make informed decisions on any proposals for such taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to know is the assessed impact on jobs in Europe and the extent to which pollution might simply be exported to low-income countries which can ill afford to cope with it. An example of this: for a leading tomato grower in Britain currently paying GBP 363 000 for its gas and GBP 60 000 for its electricity, the proposed climate change levy in Britain would increase its energy bill by GBP 149 000. That is a staggering 35% increase, an increase which would simply drive that company out of Britain and into some non-EU country, possibly in Eastern Europe, possibly in the developing world. What would then happen is that the European Union would claim to have reduced its pollution, reduced its emissions, but at a cost: firstly European jobs would be lost and secondly the world would not have reduced its pollution levels by one iota: the pollution would simply have been exported.</p>
<p class="contents">That in my view would be immoral to low-income countries and it would be insane economics for the working people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Trade Union Confederation has called on us to make sure that every step – and they do say every step – taken to implement the Kyoto targets is carefully evaluated. They are right. That is what I want. That is what I am asking the Commissioner to do. Please publish your impact assessments on jobs and on the extent to which emissions would be exported. Then we can all take an informed decision.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are also humanly created problems. The EU and the Member States should therefore stick to their goal of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 15% by the year 2010 and might well go further than that in the slightly longer term. On the other hand, the tools we use to reduce emissions will have to be effective and binding, as Mrs Hassi and Mrs Wallström emphasised. We know however that there are strong forces which are prepared to cheat the system by means of any old agreements. You can certainly do that as a way of wangling lower environmental requirements for yourself, but you cannot cheat with regard to the actual effects of climate changes. I would therefore urge the Council and the Commission to stand by the demand that at least half of the CO2 reductions are to be made on a national basis. If we lower that 50% level, then I think we should be considerably impairing the EU’s policy on climate change and also greatly reducing the EU’s credibility in continued negotiations on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The CDU Party in Germany believes, and we have recently discussed this again with our Chairman, Mr Schäuble, that we should stop continuing to work towards a European solution, just because at the national level, left-wing and Green governments are abusing the issue of environmental taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should not concentrate solely on the tax issue, as seems to have happened in the Committee to some extent, as well as in our Party. There are many aspects of reducing CO2 which we will not be able to resolve through a tax alone, perhaps not through taxation at all. I will give the example of the stand-by switch which is taken up in paragraph 9 of the motion for resolution which I proposed. Between five and ten per cent of the European Union’s energy consumption is wasted because we do not switch off our televisions and other electrical appliances, but leave them on stand-by. Five to ten per cent represents a huge contribution to energy savings, which can be achieved here if we either turn the appliances off or come up with new technical means in order to achieve a reduction in energy consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not be achieved though, by means of a tax. When someone buys a television, the question of how much energy it uses on stand-by is not generally of prime importance. They have other criteria in mind, and this is why we also need technical solutions to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to ask those of you who want to see solutions other than a tax not to raise objections again when we are holding a discussion on technical alternatives to stand-by on the grounds that this is a European regulation and you did not want that either. We must do something if we are to appear credible in the negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we discuss only CO2, because if my information is correct, 50% of the greenhouse effect is caused by other greenhouse gases. I think that we have not made this sufficiently clear in the discussion. We should give this point much greater consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finally we have professed our beliefs and that appears to be enough for most people. That would be extraordinarily dangerous! Therefore, I would like to suggest two things: firstly, we should endorse Mr Lange’s call to reach agreement on the emissions trade with the close involvement of Parliament, because such a powerful intervention in trade policy would be very difficult to carry out against Parliament’s wishes. Secondly, I suggest that we establish a binding timetable, one with real sanctions against any EU State that deviates from the targets for reduction. The model I recommend is the concerted reduction of debt, which has now made the Euro possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we feel that in order to succeed in this task, we must avoid various topics which crop up on a regular basis in discussions on the subject and we should avoid including them in the text of the resolution. </p>
<p class="contents">The first approach that we have to avoid is to think that economic development inevitably brings with it an increase in the deterioration of the environment. It is possible to neutralise to a large extent this undesirable effect of growth by making our resources more efficient. Introducing low cost efficiency measures would significantly reduce emissions. Nevertheless, attaining this objective may prove difficult for certain Member Countries, which is not what we want at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The second topic concerns the way global problems are dealt with as local issues. The European Union must show itself to be strong on this matter and encourage as many countries as possible to sign up to this commitment and fulfil it. This is the only way we will be able to accept adopting measures which will certainly be difficult and economically damaging for various European Union countries, as well as for some of those mentioned in the motion for resolution. </p>
<p class="contents">The last thing that we should avoid doing is to make the protocol’s so-called flexible mechanisms the fundamental basis for our actions. Although it is true that there are means which would potentially allow us to fulfil the commitment made in Kyoto through national strategies and measures, the economic cost of the different options varies enormously. Strategic action in the areas where the net economic costs are lower should be stepped up immediately. For this reason, and before the measures are adopted as standard for energy, we would have to ensure the adoption of this strategic action, as well as the reliability of the means of production of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, so that we can efficiently monitor the development of the problem in all countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is falling sharply behind in meeting its legally binding undertakings on reducing greenhouse gases. I would just like to mention my concerns about my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned that the Irish Government is complacent in its attitude towards its Kyoto Protocol commitments, which they entered into in December 1997. We are committed to limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases to 13% above our 1990 levels by the year 2010 or so. On current predictions Ireland’s emissions will be up to 40% above this target.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the energy tax issue, it is time we decided exactly what we mean by this. I am a great believer in more carrot and less stick, particularly when it comes to environmental protection. Just to wave taxes as a threat, without matching them with grants for retrofitting older plants so that they can comply with acceptable emission standards, and without generally increasing investment in monitoring emissions, will not work. Are we talking about climate change levies, emission taxes, energy taxes generally, carbon tax, carbon dioxide tax? I do not think we have ever put our heads together to decide exactly what we mean by it.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the point made by my EPP colleague, Mr Bowis, that under no circumstances can we export our problem from the developed world by slapping taxes on our older plants with problematic emission standards and just driving those jobs and those particular production units to the less developed regions where they are less able to cope with environmental degradation. It is a net reduction in emissions we want globally, not just exporting the problem from the West to the less developed regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very concerned about the projected increase in fluorocarbons, which are presently a minor contributor to the total greenhouse gases. We are told they will increase by 40% on current rates. That is a major cause for concern. We should turn our attention to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know how the debate is conducted in other Member States, but in my own country, it is certainly no secret that big changes are needed to reduce emissions. The question was asked here concerning the effects of reductions in emissions on jobs. Personally, I am certain that the reduction of emissions will create jobs in some areas, but it is equally true that it will mean reduced employment in others. Those who will obtain jobs are not certain of it yet, but those who are losing them know a lot more about it, and, for that reason, unfortunately, there is much stronger lobbying from their side.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members spoke of the need for financial controls and an energy tax. As you know, the Council cannot take a decision on this, so I cannot say anything at all on behalf of the Council. I can only state Finland’s position, which is that we believe it is very important for the Union to make headway in the creation of a common energy tax and we have also discussed the possibility of Member States, which are so inclined, moving forward faster in this area. One problem connected with this is whether such action would be of benefit in conflicts that could possibly arise with regard to EU competition legislation. For example, in my own country we experienced the situation where an energy tax that was brought in at national level in its first version was found to be in violation of the Union’s acts on competition. However, I think that energy taxes are one means of inducing market forces to reduce emissions and develop new, modern and clean technology, and I consider that to be very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, I would say that, as the rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and those to do with compliance with the commitments made have not yet been agreed, ratification at this stage would mean that we would not really know what we were ratifying. As these matters are being discussed internationally, I believe it is important that the EU holds the trump card, enabling it also to negotiate the terms on which it should be ratified. If the EU were to ratify it immediately, it would mean that, thereafter, it would no longer have any great significance when more precise rules were being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Linkohr that, as the Union is committed to targets for reduced emissions, we also have to decide on action in respect of those Member States that are unable to meet their commitments. The Kyoto Protocol and the climate agreement also states that if a combined body of economic cooperation such as the EU cannot achieve the targets as a whole, responsibility for the targets set for it falls to all its Member States, in other words, if some Member States cannot meet their commitments, the Union will suffer as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that the idea, which has been expressed in these deliberations, that, if nothing is done, the temperature of the Earth will have increased by two degrees in a 100 years’ time, is wrong. Restricting the rise in temperature to just two degrees over the next 100 years will take much effort. If the current trend is allowed to continue uncontrolled, with no determined climatic policy, the rise in temperature of the earth will be a lot greater than two degrees in one hundred years, and all the corresponding effects it will have will be all the more dramatic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are to assess the credibility of future scenarios which involve actually diverting the Gulf Stream and perhaps encountering a new ice age. On the other hand, we are today to try to make decisions about concrete measures which in certain cases may only take effect perhaps 50 or a 100 years in the future. We are being asked preferably to come up with specific proposals today and to speak about exactly what will happen. I believe that this is necessary because it is exactly what citizens in our respective countries are asking of us. We know that the problem exists. They too know that it exists, and they wonder: are you prepared to take decisions so that we can see a change?</p>
<p class="contents">What I have done today is to report on how the Commission and I want to tackle this problem, how we must analyse it, how we must work with a strategy and a programme in which we consider each greenhouse gas in turn and how exactly we are to manage the problems. There are already proposals on the table. The Kyoto Protocol contains a number of proposals concerning how we can proceed further and what measures need to be taken. </p>
<p class="contents">I am completely convinced that we need financial incentives. Money talks, as they say. That is when things become serious, and this is something which companies and industries understand too. On many occasions, expectations that jobs were to leave the country have proved unfounded because, instead, an environmentally friendly technique or a more efficient and environmentally-friendly use of energy has been promoted. Which is what we want to bring about.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment briefly on a number of questions which have been raised here. Where air traffic is concerned, the Commission is very conscious of the fact that this is a growing problem. We shall present a report before the end of the year. Those of us from the Environmental Directorate have of course been involved in this. In this connection, too, I am in favour of the use of financial instruments of control because we know that they are effective. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to trade in emission rights, I believe that we must first see a concrete proposal. I have said that I shall be presenting a Green Paper with just such a concrete proposal for a system. This will, of course, describe the national responsibilities which each country will have. It will not be possible for a country to buy itself free of obligations. There must be a system of rules through which, instead, countries honour their commitments in the most effective way. That is what is intended. I believe we should be on our guard against language. You see, words channel the way people think. If you use a concept such as “an exchange for trade in emission rights”, then I think that we are feeding the thought that this is to be a cynical system in which it will be possible for countries to buy themselves free of obligations. Now, this is definitely not my approach. Any system must be sensibly regulated, and we must make sure that a lot more interests are involved. If we do not have industry with us, if we do not have the citizens of the European Union with us and, above all, if we cannot take political decisions, then it is not going to work. In that case, we shall not succeed in this undertaking. We must mobilise on a much broader basis. In fact, I believe that, in general, our citizens are the ones who are more acutely conscious of these issues and that their willingness to act is greater than that of the politicians in our Member States just now. That is the big worry. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to an energy tax, I cannot judge exactly how long it is going to take to introduce this. It is something which we have to discuss in the Commission. If the fact of the matter is that it is going to take too long a time, then I am prepared to support a proposal to the effect that a number of countries go on ahead in order to show the way and demonstrate that it can be an effective way of achieving results where the issue of climate change is concerned. </p>

I would like to ask Mrs Wallström again, to go into some specific details. Firstly, there was the question on when we can expect industry-specific plans for reduction, and timetables for this from the Commission. Secondly, there was the question raised by two of us on the subject of CO2 emissions from aviation fuel. The question obviously still remains as to how you produce a Directive on phasing in renewable energies, and providing compensation which actually covers the costs. I would be most grateful to you if you could answer these three specific points. I do not know if you are in a position to as you have so recently taken up your post. I think that we are agreed that we should all do something to protect the environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before the end of the year, we are to present a Green Paper describing a system for trade in emission rights (one of the flexible mechanisms). We are to get an action programme under way, requiring us specifically to examine each area in turn and involve all interested parties. This is necessary because there is no such plan at the present time. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall also, of course, try to push forward the integration process as far as possible. Exact dates cannot be given. The question of energy taxes has been on the agenda for six years. I wish I could say that results will be seen no later than tomorrow, but it is going to take a little longer than that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
