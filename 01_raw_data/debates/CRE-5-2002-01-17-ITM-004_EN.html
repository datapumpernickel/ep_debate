We therefore welcome this Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion, we should see the communication as the starting point for an open dialogue with operators, research scientists, political institutions and consumers. The integration of environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy must happen in such a way that it has the sector’s support, without the costs being borne solely and exclusively by the fisheries sector, particularly since this means small fishing businesses, and in view, especially, of the fact that the sector is the victim of forms of pollution of the marine ecosystem caused by external factors such as marine transport<span class="bold"> </span>and coastal industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I feel that the integration of environmental requirements must have a scientific basis, and we hope to receive specific data which is the product of current research from the Commission soon. In the meantime, we must certainly apply the precautionary principle, but, in this case as well, we need to adopt measures which do not jeopardise the income of small fishing businesses and are different from those proposed by the Commission. Indeed, where the Commission speaks of the interaction between the fisheries sector and the environment, it does little more than list the harmful effects of fisheries on the environment, overlooking positive environmental measures which could benefit the fisheries sector such as improvement of coastal areas, creation of restocking and nursery zones, protected marine areas, increasing tourist fishing and investment in research.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, in the face of the very real problem of overfishing, in my humble opinion, the Executive is not drawing up alternative proposals to the drastic solution of terminating the fishing activity altogether, the result of which would be to drive the fishermen away from the sector without establishing adequate accompanying or support measures for them. Therefore, in the proposal contained in the report adopted by the Parliamentary Committee on Fisheries, we call upon the Executive to improve coordination of research into fisheries and research into marine biology, not to cut structural aid and to pay greater attention to the specific character of the Mediterranean, whose diversified, multi-species fishery warrants appropriate legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we are not asking for exceptions to be made for the Mediterranean to current bans such as those on the swordfish nets known as <span class="italic">spadare</span>; however, we are calling for agreements with third countries banning or limiting this method of fishing, for otherwise, we will merely be penalising our fishermen without resolving the problem of overfishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must call for greater attention to be paid to eco-labelling, as a response, not least, to the dioxins in fisheries products alarm which has knocked consumer confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present report discusses the integration of the environment into the common fisheries policy, and a part of the Green Paper also refers to the preservation of the environment in the marine sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the strategy of integrating the environmental policy into the rest of the Union’s policies is a strategy which has been mentioned in recent European Councils repeatedly – especially in the Gothenburg European Council – but which is applied little in practice, especially in relation to the industrial policy, the fisheries policy and other Union policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the fisheries sector – as the rapporteur says – it is unacceptable, for example, that a third of catches are destined for destruction for the production of meal and oils, especially if we also bear in mind that those meals and oils are not controlled and may later end up in the food chain, which could lead once again to a lack of food safety which is of so much concern in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must respect reproduction periods and use nets that do not desolate the marine environment. We are witnessing on our coasts the continuous use of nets which desolate and wipe out all life on the seabed. Biological diversity must be preserved, as laid down in the sixth environmental action programme – which we discussed this week and which we are going to vote on at noon – preventing pollution of coastal areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I live in a country in which we are surrounded by coastal areas that are extremely beautiful and rich, but which are constantly affected by the actions of industry and excessive pressure from tourism. This also endangers fishing. I believe that we must not only act on the capacity of the fleet so that the resources we have can be replenished, but that we have to act, above all, on the sources of pollution which impede our marine wealth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thoroughly agree with that, so long as it is washed down with copious quantities of Scotch whisky.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the terms of Mr Lavarra's report, but I would like to ask for support from this House for the two amendments by my Danish colleague, Mr Busk. Mr Busk is quite rightly concerned that the rapporteur has taken a rather negative attitude to industrial fishing, which, as we know, is a mainstay of the Danish fishing industry. The Committee on Fisheries recently visited Denmark and met key people involved in industrial fisheries. Again, yesterday, there was a seminar here in Strasbourg organised by the Intergroup on Sustainable Development, which heard all sides of the debate for and against industrial fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that there are many and widespread misconceptions regarding this sector and it is important that this House corrects these misconceptions. Firstly, it is worth pointing out that the sandeel fishery is a clean fishery: by-catch is relatively unusual and where, on occasion, there have been well-publicised cases of juvenile haddock or other by-catch being landed by Danish industrial trawlers, these cases have been brought to our attention because Denmark has an effective inspection and monitoring regime with very strict discipline and very stringent punishments for offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as indicated by Mr Busk in his amendments, the TAC for sandeel has actually been reduced by the Council this year to 850 000 tonnes, against scientific evidence which stated that we could take over a million tonnes. Only 25% of the sandeel biomass is being fished. Compare that to the 75% of the cod biomass that we exploit in the North Sea. So if anyone is guilty of overfishing, it is certainly not the sandeel fishery in Denmark. They have also invested a lot of money in getting dioxins out of oil, fish oils and fishmeal, which is a product of the sandeel fishery. We must support the Danish fishing sector in this case, and that is why I ask this House to support Mr Busk's two amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busk (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, first of all I want to say thank you to Mr Lavarra for an excellent piece of work in connection with the report. I am able to support the conclusions overall, and I would particularly call upon us to create new development opportunities in the European fisheries sector by integrating environmental considerations into the common fisheries policy. The forthcoming revision of the common fisheries policy will also ensure much more far-reaching implementation of the common decisions in all the Member States. We must dare to talk openly about what fish, as ‘raw materials’, mean for the fishing industry in those countries which have extensive fisheries, and we must also put the regional importance of fisheries into the balance alongside the risks involved and application of the precautionary principle. Moreover, we must also recognise the major contribution that fishermen make to daily life.</p>
<p class="contents">I will concentrate, then, on a few points I disagree about. I want to begin by saying thank you to Mr Stevenson who has talked in very clear terms about the experiences of the Committee on Fisheries’ delegation in Denmark and about how, in Denmark, it has been possible completely to remove the mystique from sand eel fishing, as well as to rebut the many assertions to the effect that it is industrial fishing that is destroying the food chain. We therefore need to state that there is now no scientific basis for saying that industrial fishing has a negative effect on the marine environment. Without a sound scientific basis, it is rash to want to cut back on industrial fishing, something which would have major consequences for jobs in the fisheries sector. What we must do, therefore, is to strive to obtain a broader and better scientific basis in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I support item 9, which is factually incorrect in as much as it would be particularly unreasonable not to use fishmeal and fish oil, which are products very rich in protein and which are of very great value. What is more, the European fishmeal industry has made very great strides towards developing a technique for eliminating dioxin. In other words, it would really be much healthier in the short term if we were to think in terms of using fishmeal to feed fish within aquacultures rather than, if I may say so, in terms of their receiving it through the normal food chain out in the oceans where, right now, the dioxin content is unfortunately higher than we would wish. In this context, it is important to note that dioxin does not come naturally from the sea and is not found naturally in fish, but is a form of pollution that comes from the land. There are unfortunately too many food scandals, and it is therefore also important for us to point out that the fisheries sector is as a rule the victim and that it has not been possible subsequently to prove that it is this sector that is liable for the scandals or occurrences in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is unable to support item 14, since we are opposed to financial aid for the construction of new vessels. As I was very pleased to hear Mr Stevenson also do, I must naturally call for us to support the two amendments I have tabled on behalf of the ELDR Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things, it seeks to relieve the fishing sector of responsibility for depleted fish stocks by saying that it is the fault of pollution, habitat destruction etc. While these factors play a role, there is no doubt whatsoever that the major cause of depleted fish stocks is the excessive amount of fishing carried out by the fishing fleets of the European Union. It is time we stopped this state of denial and faced reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We also object to the calls for alternatives to the decommissioning of fishing vessels, which is the single most important step towards allowing stocks to recover. We also need to look at the fact that vessels are being transported to other parts of the world, thereby simply passing the problem on. Considering the desperate need to incorporate the concept of environmental protection into fisheries, this report falls far short of what is required. The Verts/ALE Group cannot support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
