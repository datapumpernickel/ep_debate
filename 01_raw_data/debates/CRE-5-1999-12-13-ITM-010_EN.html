It is in fact a regulation which really needs to be adopted and implemented, for the situation we are facing is quite serious. </p>
<p class="contents">The depletion of the ozone layer is becoming more and more obvious. The Commission’s first document describes the depletion over Scandinavia, Greenland and Siberia as being a record. Unfortunately, we now probably have to say that this record has been beaten again. Last week, measurements were presented which showed that the situation has never been more serious than it is now. I would especially emphasise this for the benefit of those Members of the European Parliament who have had doubts about the value of hastening the phasing out of ozone-destroying substances. I would also emphasise this for the benefit of other people who say that it costs too much to achieve so little as a percentage or two reduction in the depletion of the ozone layer. That is not the case! The hole in the ozone layer is not an invention. Nor is the fact that it is getting larger!</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore now have a unique opportunity with the adoption of this regulation and of the amendments to which the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has said yes. These measures are not enough to “repair” the hole in the ozone layer, but they are a step in the right direction which it is necessary to take. We are aware of the causes of the problem, we are aware of the consequences and, in the vast majority of cases, we also have alternatives. In those cases where there are no alternatives, the regulation provides acceptable margins for industry to succeed in making the required transition. It is we who are to decide whether this is to become a reality. </p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that this proposal is not an attempt to prevent alterations to on-going climate change. Arguments of this kind have been put forward but, as far as I am concerned, these are just attempts to cloud the issue. We need to solve both problems. A number of the substances which are nowadays used as replacements for the HCFC substances that the debate has come to revolve around have an effect upon the environment. So too, however, have the substances we use today, a fact of which we are well aware. There is therefore no reason for reintroducing the HCFC substances into processes in which they have been prohibited for the last five years. This is taken up in Article 5(3) in the Council’s common position, of which I am strongly critical. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a ban in place, and relaxing this can hardly be in keeping with the objective of the regulation. I would therefore address the Commission and ask if they are really serious about this. Large parts of industry operating in this sphere have already adapted their production methods and found alternatives, and yet the European organisation for this branch of industry, EUROFEU, is quite unable to see the point of the change. I would ask the Commission why. What is behind this U-turn? I hope that, in its vote on Wednesday, the House will comply with the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection to remove this Article in its entirety. In this connection, I would also mention Amendment No 34 which has been introduced into the plenary sitting. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is just as unreasonable. </p>
<p class="contents">The other matter I consider to be crucial to this regulation, if it is to be forward-looking, is the continued use of methyl bromide. We know that methyl bromide is one of the biggest villains where the ozone layer is concerned. It is also a very poisonous substance which affects those who work with it and which does not only exterminate unwanted noxious insects but also all organisms in the earth. It affects water, air and people. The time is ripe for a ban. Moreover, we have for a long time now had alternatives available in this sphere which are in many cases much more profitable than what we make use of today. I would therefore emphasise the importance of Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4 and 10 which reduce the opportunity for continued use of methyl bromide, except in certain extreme circumstances. I would also mention Amendment No 12 concerning quarantine arrangements in connection with shipments. The regulation does not provide for any clear phasing out of these.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also direct the House’s and the Commission’s attention to Amendment No 9 which provides the opportunity to use chloroflourocarbons in certain extremely special cases, for example to offer pain relief to people who are seriously ill. I should also like the Commission to review the narrow time limits which are given in the regulation. The discussion of this matter has, however, been delayed. In this context, I would therefore put in a word for the small and medium-sized companies which have done their utmost to comply with the intentions of the regulation but which have nonetheless still not achieved their objective. A certain understanding of the situation in which they find themselves is to be desired. </p>
<p class="contents">At the plenary sitting, further amendments were also tabled which have not been adopted or discussed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection; one of these I have already mentioned. These are Amendments Nos 30, 31, 32 and 34, which are scarcely in keeping with the regulation. I would put a question mark over Amendment No 32, which has clearly been mistranslated both in the Swedish version and in other versions. I would therefore move the rejection of these amendments. Amendment No 35 is covered by Amendment No 39 and is therefore superfluous. Otherwise, applause for all the amendments which the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has adopted.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Flemming (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mrs Hulthén has already said a great deal. I do not wish to repeat it all. She did not emphasise the fact that the present common position probably represents the maximum which is possible at the present time. I know from the Austrian Presidency that people fought to the bitter end to ensure that the ozone layer was properly protected. Mrs Hulthén, you know how strongly I have urged you to withdraw amendments so as to allow the common position to take effect quickly. I also said to you that amendments would be tabled which did not seek – as your amendments do – to move forward even more rapidly and quickly, but even to find a way back. As an Austrian, I have no problem at all with moving forward more rapidly and quickly. But we have to learn that there are other countries which have not come as far as the Nordic countries, Austria and Germany and that we also have to give them an opportunity to move forward together with us on this. I am sorry that you did not do this because, of course, moves are now afoot which we perhaps do not like at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always taken the lead on phasing out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances, and in terms of environment policy Parliament has been the European Union's conscience. This is the only way in which we can exert pressure on other States in international conferences; to show them what works, what is possible and what demands can be placed on industry – and industry in Europe has in many cases switched to new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission I will examine a small example in more detail. It is Amendment No 34. Halons are very dangerous. HCFCs are not as dangerous by far in terms of ozone-layer depletion. Nevertheless, surely it would be ludicrous to replace a dangerous substance with a less dangerous one. We only need to produce this less dangerous substance in sufficient quantities and we have the same potential for causing damage. Do you not finally see that this is the wrong approach? You cannot replace halons in fire protection systems with HCFCs! There are several alternative substances available in the form of natural gases, such as nitrous argon and inergen. Austria has a very, very valuable library, the Austrian National Library. We have a fire protection system of this kind there which manages without any of these dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that none of the amendments put forward receives the 314 votes. Because if we are serious about this, if we want to take a quick step forward, then the common position needs to bear fruit very soon. You see, whether it is CFCs, HCFCs or halons, today's emissions will do their damage up there in twenty or thirty years' time. In thirty years all of us – or many or most of us – will already be dead. But the destruction, for which we share the responsibility here today and will do at the vote on Wednesday, will also be our fault. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been even more difficult at second reading as we have had a lot of competing views, conflicting scientific opinion and lobbying from various interested parties in the industry on specific substances. Nevertheless, the rapporteur has done a marvellous job and what we have in front of us now is a coherent set of amendments, a coherent position that goes further than the common position, further than Mrs Flemming thinks we can go. I am surprised at what she says as we went further than the common position a week ago in Beijing. We must give it our support.</p>
<p class="contents">There are very serious issues at stake here. If the ozone layer is not repaired as quickly as possible and damage halted, there will be widespread skin cancer, widespread eye damage among the human population around the world. This is already starting to happen in some places.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as Europeans, have to maintain our lead and set an example. There can be no going back on any particular substances, despite some pleading to do so. We can only allow the continued use of certain other substances where there is a genuine threat of smuggling into the Union of other supplies that might be used to continue supporting existing equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that the Montreal Protocol has progressed step by step. Last week we saw it take another step in Beijing. We have moved on to getting rid of CFCs, moving on to deal with the other substances – HCFCs and halons. We must continue to ensure that process carries on. In the European Union we must help in assisting Third World and developing countries to move quickly into new technologies that do not harm the ozone layer, that do not use ozone-destroying chemicals. In that sense, we must support the rapporteur's amendments and look very carefully at some of the amendments which I hope we will see in conciliation in order to achieve further progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has been very little opposition to the principle of phasing out HCFCs and methyl bromide. The question in committee has been about the timescales which should be involved. All Members have been presented with a great deal of conflicting factual information which has made reaching a judgement difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, the Liberal Democrats want to ensure that rapid progress is made, that we see the maximum benefits in the shortest possible period. But the choices are not simple. There is a real fear that some of the well-intentioned amendments which have been tabled by the rapporteur may actually make the situation worse; in particular, that it will make it difficult for us to phase out across the world, and especially in the developing nations, the harmful CFCs which are so much more detrimental to the ozone layer than the items mentioned in this report. The benefits to be gained from these proposals are too small for us to take that risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the rapporteur's aims and will be supporting most of her amendments but we are not convinced that she has addressed our concerns for the environment in their entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Action to tackle ozone layer degradation is considered to be one of the very few success stories of international environmental legislation, and since the mid-1990s ozone depletion does seem to have slowed down, mainly due to efforts to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is no room at all for complacency. We are a long way from achieving our goals. According to the European Environment Agency, in the summer of 1998 the ozone over Antarctica reached a record low level over an area the size of Europe, and the same thing is happening in the northern hemisphere. So ambitious targets must be set and they must be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's original proposal is along the right lines. However, we believe that the Council weakened the text and so I would like to call on colleagues to support the amendments which were adopted in committee to improve the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time, a study shows that the protective layer of ozone has reached worrying and record-low values over Scandinavia. We know what we need to do. Where this particular environmental issue is concerned, we know what is causing the problems. We know precisely which substances destroy ozone. We know what the effects will be upon people if levels of ultra-violet radiation increase, including effects in terms of significantly more cases of cancer. We also know how the natural environment is being damaged. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, there are nowadays perfectly acceptable alternatives to the vast majority of ozone-depleting substances, and these are used in a variety of spheres. Ozone-destroying substances have a deleterious effect over a very long period. In spite of the fact that international cooperation in this area through the Montreal Protocol has been successful and that emissions have declined considerably, it will not be possible for the ozone layer to be restored before some time round about the year 2040 at the earliest. Until this happens, it is estimated that there will also be an increase in the damage caused, for example in the form of new cases of cancer. There is, then, no good reason for postponing further measures which we can take right now. It is therefore important that Mrs Hulthén’s report be adopted in its entirety. By means of the proposals submitted in this report, more powerful measures can be taken against ozone-destroying substances such as methyl bromide and chloroflourocarbons. </p>
<p class="contents">Our group is therefore going to vote in favour of all the amendments from the rapporteur. On the other hand, we are not going to vote in favour of most of the amendments which have been put forward by others, because these amendments would weaken the report. </p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats voted against many of the rapporteur’s proposals. There has also been vigorous lobbying by industry on this issue. Hopefully, national declarations exist, or else there are individuals within the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats who put environmental considerations first and who will have the courage to vote in favour of the important proposals in the report. It will be interesting to see the results of the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will not take the desired effect i.e. filling the ozone hole until 100 years from now. We also hope that the number of cases of skin cancer will have dropped. </p>
<p class="contents">As was already the case at first reading, the phasing-out process can be accelerated. There are alternatives available and the benefits clearly outweigh the drawback of transitional costs. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the proposals submitted by Mrs Hulthén to improve the common position. CFCs and methyl bromide can be phased out more quickly. In the Netherlands, the use of methyl bromide has been banned for years. This does not pose any problems within the agricultural sector. Quite the opposite, in fact. There is no loss of harvest and it is better for the health of the workers within agriculture and horticulture. It must be possible to stop using methyl bromide as from 2001. Hence, exceptions for emergency situations seem completely redundant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My country, Spain, fully enters into the spirit of the Montreal Protocol and is committed to fulfilling its terms in a completely responsible and active way. It accepts, in general terms therefore, the common position and in this sense, I fully agree with the intervention by my colleague Mrs Flemming. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this is no obstacle to Spain, with its firm desire to carry out the eradication of the use of specific toxic substances that damage the ozone layer, which regards itself as being particularly affected by the banning of one of them, methyl bromide, which was referred to a while ago. This substance, which is used as an agricultural disinfectant mainly in clearly defined farming zones in the Mediterranean regions is already strictly limited in my country in terms of its marketing and use and has already been replaced in all cases for which suitable alternatives have been found. Work has been done for quite a while on investigating replacement substances in order to meet the deadline laid down in the Protocol. </p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because we want to comply with the standard, we have to be very careful when it comes to weighing up our ability to do so, if Parliament approves a regulation that makes the conditions and the time-scales tougher. It would be more honest and above all more practical to state clearly that we see that there is a possibility that we will not be able to comply where methyl bromide is concerned. At the very least this will cause us to suffer serious financial and social consequences and the competitiveness of some of our agricultural products will be damaged in relation to other countries that do not apply the same restrictions. We will not be able to ensure that the use of methyl bromide stops by shortening the time-scales. Instead, we run the risk of unwillingly failing to comply and the possibility of fraud which will produce the opposite result to the one we all want to see. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party feels that it is necessary to uphold in the plenary sitting the amendments relating to the first paragraph of Article 3(2) and the last paragraph of Article 21 in which the exceptions and conditions for the use of methyl bromide after 2006 are specified. We think that Parliament must set standards that all Member States should be able to fulfil without experiencing serious damage to their economic, social and environmental conditions. It is this spirit, not an emotionally praiseworthy but unrealistic environmental good will, which leads us to put forward these amendments today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this regulation, the European Union is establishing the means and time periods for the progressive elimination of the substances which deplete the ozone layer, and I can assure you that I do not underestimate the danger of the current situation at all. </p>
<p class="contents">The drive to further speed this up, set in motion by Parliament at first reading, has been broadly accepted by the Council. Despite this, Mrs Hulthén’s report again re-submits amendments which were not adopted, which indiscriminately anticipate the dates of bans on the production, marketing and use of the various substances. In general, it is a question of an approach, or rather, a commendable intention consistent with the Montreal Protocol which, however, at the same time, does not take some facts into account: firstly, the fact that the other countries that are signatories of the Protocol, including the United States, anticipate longer time periods for ending the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons; secondly, hydrochlorofluorocarbons are, given the current state of knowledge, the only real alternative in the field of fire-fighting, to halogens, the main destroyers of the ozone layer, which are still widely used in developing countries. </p>
<p class="contents">We are not convinced either, by the inflexibility that the report wants to maintain regarding methyl bromide. I am sorry that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection did not want to seek a reasonable compromise based on the principle of realism. At times, we have the impression that, according to one interpretation of protecting the environment, the asserting of principles, if not flying the environmental flag, is ultimately more important than the actual result. The European Union has to be at the cutting edge, it has even been said this evening, but, as regards restoring the ozone layers in the stratosphere, and similarly, controlling the greenhouse effect, the result cannot be measured on the basis of Europe’s speed, but only by taking an overall view. For these reasons, the common position of the Council, even if it is not completely satisfactory, certainly seems more balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An exemption of this kind is granted for CFC-11 to the firm Du Pont in Luxembourg for the manufacture of polyolefin fibres. Du Pont itself has developed an alternative to CFC-11. This alternative is currently being examined by the competent authorities in Luxembourg. There is therefore no reason at all to continue to maintain this exemption. I would therefore ask you, in particular Mrs Flemming and the other Members of the PPE-DE Group, to vote for Amendment No 28. We are not dealing with a developing country here; this is sophisticated technology in a highly developed country.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmentalists in Luxembourg have campaigned for this exemption to be abolished. The Environment Minister is behind them.

I agree with the rapporteur that the effects of this are now clearly visible. Preserving the ozone layer is one of the main aims of our environment policy. We are all responsible for preventing damage to mankind and animals as well as to the entire ecosystem. That is why substances which destroy the ozone layer need to be replaced with alternative substances as quickly as possible. However, realistic transitional periods need to be set for switching to alternative substances. I wish to stress the word "realistic".</p>
<p class="contents">Where it is clear that alternative substances are available which do the same job, the procedure needs to be carried out within the period prescribed. However, there are exceptions too and we also need to have a clear picture when we address these. In the chemical industry certain refrigeration equipment is indispensable for processes of chemical manufacturing. These refrigeration units are self-contained cooling systems and use a coolant for which no alternative is available at the present time. The size and complexity of self-contained cooling systems also make it necessary to grant an exemption. That is why I have tabled Amendment No 30 to the report, and I would ask for this to be taken into consideration. These cooling systems – I should like to point out once more – are self-contained systems and the coolant does not penetrate into the atmosphere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the second reading stage, the Members from the first legislative phase cannot make any contribution to improving the content of provisions which will then be adopted by Parliament, which clearly creates a deep sense of frustration. But this frustration becomes deeper still, more bitter when, in the light of new scientific evidence, such as in the case of ozone-depleting substances, bureaucracy and emotion take priority over politics and science, and do not render admissible amendments that are new and sound from a scientific point of view. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am asking all the Members to adopt Amendment No 34, already tabled in committee by Mr Bowis and Mr Sacconi and signed today by 32 Members. The amendment that we intend to have adopted regarding the inflexible and closed position of the rapporteur, Mrs Hulthén, and those who blindly support her, calls for a short postponement, until 1 January 2004, of the ban on HCFCs in fire protection systems. These substances exhibit a very low potential for depleting the ozone – 1200 times less than halons – and they are much better tolerated by the environment than substances such as HFCs and PFCs, which are unfortunately permitted by Parliament despite the fact that they are more detrimental to the environment because they have a high potential for global warming and linger in they atmosphere, for as long as six to seven thousand years. </p>
<p class="contents">These conclusions are shared by high-level scientific bodies at international level, such as the Cairo Conference of 1998, the contracting parties of the Montreal Protocol, the Panel on Ozone Depletion of 1999 and the Ministry for the Environment of Great Britain. The gradual banning of HCFCs called for in the amendment, along with the well-founded scientific reasons, also recognises social reasons, because a lot of people risk losing their job. This is why I am asking for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many of the amendments are designed to accelerate the phase-out schedules for HCFCs and methyl bromide, an objective which the Commission certainly shares in the light of their significant and increasing contribution to ozone depletion.</p>
<p class="contents">European SMEs which are leading in the development of the alternatives have proved that rapid phase-out of remaining ozone depleting substances promotes sustainable industries and additional ozone layer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Complex negotiations in the Council led to the adoption of an acceptable common position last February. Its quick adoption is the Commission's priority. The Commission cannot go as fast as it would like in some issues, as we are rapidly approaching some of the proposed phase-out dates. It is important to avoid the introduction of the new ozone depleting substances. Amendment No 27 would introduce an expedited procedure for adding new ozone depleting substances to the regulation, which would be useful in deferring unwise investments while benefiting the ozone layer. The Commission can therefore accept this amendment in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 is also acceptable since it allows time-limited extensions for the use of very small quantities of CFCs in a specialised type of medical devices for pain relief. Other amendments that the Commission accepts, either totally, in principle or in part, are Amendments Nos 1, 4, 11, 12, 15, 17, 24, 25, 26, 29, 31, 32 and 35. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 10 as they would bring forward the first cuts in production and use of methylbromide to unrealistically early dates – 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2001 respectively. This would cause procedural difficulties and problems for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3 which would remove any exemptions beyond 2006. This would penalise individual farmers or certain crops disproportionally.</p>
<p class="contents">Strict controls on HCFC production and trade with non-parties to the Montreal Protocol are part of the Community ozone policy. Two weeks ago, in the Beijing meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Community succeeded in introducing such measures into the Protocol. However, excessively harsh measures going beyond the common position could shift the market to overseas producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 8 and 23 advancing the phase-out schedule and imposing an immediate trade ban cannot therefore be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several amendments that bring forward the controls on HCFC uses. The current position represents a careful balance between what is environmentally desirable, technically feasible and economically achievable. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 16 which would tighten the deadlines further for the phasing out of HCFC use in solvents, air conditioning and polyurethane foams. This could bring increased problems and lead to cash flow problems for companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 18 and 34 on the possible use of HCFCs as a replacement to halons in fire fighting. Expanding it is unnecessary and limiting it is of little, if any, practical consequence. Such changes would affect a crucial part of the common position compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 28 relates to Article 5 and bans the use of CFCs and HCFCs as a processing agent immediately in a specific application. The Commission cannot accept this amendment because there is a need to provide for transitional time for phase-out. Nor can the Commission accept Amendment No 19 banning sales of used HCFC-containing equipment within five years after the respective use ban as it would increase the probability of illegal dumping and venting of HCFCs to the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission has sympathy for Amendment No 20 that would ban the production of HCFC-containing products for export over the three years after respective domestic use ban, we have to maintain the balance between environmental desirability and the risk that manufacturing would relocate elsewhere. The Commission cannot therefore accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, while we support the intention of Amendment No 21, it would be incompatible with the exemption in Article 5(6) for specific cases and therefore cannot be accepted. Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 22 as exemptions would in any case be granted in full consultation with Member States, and thus it cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 30 which seeks to expand the possibilities to grant exemptions for substances that have already been phased out. It is important to send the unambiguous message that when a substance is phased out no further exemptions should be allowed except those that qualify as essential uses.</p>
