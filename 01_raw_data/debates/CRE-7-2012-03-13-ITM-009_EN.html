<p class="contents">I am, however, unable fully to support it. I am particularly concerned with the issue of clawback, which raises uncertainty in a person’s estate, suggesting that their decisions pre-death may not be final. In England and Wales, we operate a system where the individual has the right to decide the apportionment of their estate. Importantly, this gives individuals the right to freely choose whether they would like to give a portion of this to a charity, for example, after their death. No EU legislation should interfere with this personal decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If our job is to create a little more legal certainty for the citizens of Europe and a little more trust in the European Union, then Mr Lechner has, in my opinion, submitted a very good report today. It deserves our admiration. We have introduced a proposal which, firstly, guarantees legal certainty in issues of international succession and, secondly, gives European citizens the option of choosing between the inheritance law of the country where they live or of their home country. In my view, this is a significant move towards self-determination for the citizens of the EU. We believe that this will simplify considerably the administration of estates in Europe. In addition, this is a successful step towards implementing a European internal market and a European legal culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would be concerned, were it introduced, that it would adversely affect charities in the UK as it would affect the certainty with which they can view donations. The clawback mechanism applies retrospectively. There is potential for gifts or donations given to charities during the lifetime of a benefactor then being annulled by their legal heirs upon the benefactor’s death. Given the Council’s refusal to allow an exception on this point for the UK, we felt in the ECR that we could not opt into this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More diversity on boards, when twinned with effective selection procedures that put the correct focus on expertise and experience, has been proven to be good for corporate governance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I cannot support the concept of mandatory quotas. Not only is it patronising to women, it is completely against the concept of shareholder engagement that we are all so keen to foster in European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to achieve meaningful, non-tokenistic representation of women on boards is by industry initiatives, such as the 30% club in the United Kingdom, which encourages business leaders to take affirmative action in moving voluntarily towards a better gender balance at all levels of their organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach has the added benefit of encouraging institutional shareholders to take a positive role in promoting women to positions of leadership, but the real problem of gender equality exists one step down, at the management level. Correcting this will involve long-term planning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was a time when we had something we called the principle of subsidiarity – that is to say, the condition that the EU would not interfere unless it was absolutely necessary. If the Member States could deal with a matter themselves, then they should do so. Reading through this report, I see no trace of this principle of subsidiarity: matrimonial law, day nurseries, registered partnerships, nursery school opening times, the definition of the concept of family, maternity leave and wage formation – all of this is included in this report as something that the EU should interfere in. If it was not actually laughable, it would be enough to make you cry.

I am pleased that the report addresses a number of these.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I agree it is frustrating that progress on gender equality is slowing, if not at a standstill. We must address – especially in times of economic crisis where belts are tightening – the problem that women earn, on average, 17.5% less than men across the EU. Gender stereotypes, often leading to discrimination in the workplace, must also be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for the European observatory on gender-based violence to be made operational as soon as possible is fully supported, while I agree that the EU Victims’ Package must include provisions to support women who have been forced to marry or who have been the victims of genital mutilation as a result of religious practices.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report goes on to call for EU influence over maternity leave, quotas for female representation in elected positions, the combating of gender-based violence through EU-wide legal instruments and pension rights, all of which I believe are better addressed at a national level rather than at a European level. On issues such as quotas, I firmly believe it is up to the nation state and national parties to decide how they will address the gender imbalance. There are many points of agreement within this report, but often it goes too far and I cannot support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This same friend of mine is making a very important statement: ‘The strength of women lies in their weakness’. I firmly believe in the truth of what my friend is saying. I also strongly believe that the suffragette movement nearly two centuries ago achieved much less than the wives of the lords achieved, who remained at home with their meek attitude to their lords.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I cannot accept the aggressive approach and tone of the report from Ms in’ t Veld which, in my view, does a disservice to women. Even Ms in ’t Veld’s own group had tabled amendments to this report to tone it down.</p>
<p class="contents">As a further point, I would like to add that we have witnessed exceptional hypocrisy on this matter because, by waiving Ms Morvai’s immunity, this Parliament has punished her for defending women against domestic violence. The next moment, we will be adopting a resolution against domestic violence. I find this hypocrisy outrageous and oppose it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The other major lie here is that in using disenfranchised women as an alibi, the report attempts to bring across its own agenda to legalise prostitution, extend abortion and force same-sex marriage on Member States.

Motherhood, raising children, as well as caring for family and close relatives contribute to the overall well-being of society at least as much as values created through working in a job or engaging in business. Equality does not mean a denial of the exceptionality of women, mothers, but the valuing of motherhood and allowing women freedom in their self-realisation. In this, however, the report failed.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of supporting motherhood, the report underlines the value of abortion. Instead of supporting the family as the natural environment for birth and raising children, the report underlines bonds with persons other than heterosexuals.

I refuse to accept that there are no competent women out there able to take part in economic decisions that affect the lives of over 500 million EU citizens, or that the Bank’s dealings with Greece and other troubled economies over the coming years would not benefit from a female perspective.

<p class="contents">It is regrettable that women are so badly under-represented in politics. We must encourage improvement on the 24% EU national average of women in political decision-making roles. The situation is even worse in Westminster in the UK where 22% of Members of Parliament are women. Considering that 51% of the UK population is female, this imbalance becomes stark. I therefore support ideas such as mentoring programmes, whereby training and exchange programmes could be used to better promote young women’s political participation and I commend the work of the Conservative Women’s Organisation in the UK in encouraging young women. I even recognise that my own Conservative Party has tried to promote women by supporting all-women shortlists, as David Cameron did in 2009, and so it should be that nation states and parties within nation states should have the freedom to address the gender imbalance as they see fit.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I do oppose is the EU creating a top-down approach, whereby they impose quotas and other measures to address the gender imbalance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, for nearly 20 years, my party has had remarkable success with a female chair.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the big question is this: is this really the only human characteristic that is important? If we have quotas for women because they are women, then why not have quotas for many other things? What about geographical quotas? I am sure that no one would claim that a candidate from the regions would be less qualified than a candidate from a city. Or what about age quotas? I am certain that on very many of the lists and the boards of directors around Europe, there is a clear excess of older people. Is that not an unreasonable case of discrimination? Or what about sexual quotas? A homosexual is obviously just as good a person as a heterosexual. Around one in twenty of Europe’s citizens are homosexual, so how about creating homosexual quotas? This would result in us operating in a state of chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to make it clear that the reason I have voted against this report today is not that I am against women, elderly people or homosexuals; it is because I am against quotas and the idea that people can be tallied up in quotas.

I strongly believe – as do some of my female colleagues who have already spoken – and I am glad that it is women who are talking about this, that they are offended that we are supposed to lay down, in some artificial way, whether they are to be allowed to speak, or whether they are to occupy some very important position.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the joint declaration adopted at the 66th UN General Assembly in New York recommends ever greater political participation by women, because this has a positive meaning for democracy, etc. Of course, there are many documents that encourage Member States to work towards eliminating discrimination. I can agree with that. However, I strongly believe that the introduction of quotas for women is not the right approach, and rather demeans women. Reserving places through quotas so that women can have more of a say, when, in the normal competition of people and ideas, they can honestly argue their position, is misguided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report which sets out some very practical and realistic measures, unlike the last report which we debated here.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender quotas, in my opinion, are the only real means of change. I look at the Irish Parliament. It has a record high of 26 females since we got our independence in 1922 – that is what we have now. In percentage terms, it only represents 16% of the composition of Parliament, a far cry from the 30% target set by the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to reinvent our political system so that it is gender-balanced. I look at Spain, for example, and Belgium, where they introduced gender quotas. The proportions of women in Parliament have rocketed since the introduction of legally-binding quotas. Belgium, for example: 12.7% in 2007, 35% now; Spain: 26% in 2008, 36.3% now; but I want to emphasise that it is only a very temporary measure until we get gender balance – because that is what it is all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They want to decide for them. According to them, the ambitions of women are the same as the ambitions of men. To manage a company, political party or government. Children and family are an obstacle. To overcome it, the right to abortion and employment quotas must be introduced. However, quotas do not solve discrimination, they deepen it. The majority of women also have the ambition of becoming mothers. They are discriminated against because they do a lot of work that nobody wants to see. From the employers’ perspective, the readiness of women to care for their nearest and dearest is a risk that they deal with through not hiring women, lower pay or career stagnation. Lower pay is then reflected negatively in the retirement pensions of each and every mother. From the viewpoint of women, then, this is a threefold injustice. This is the real problem facing women of today. I was unable to vote for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted in favour of it, and if we compare this to the report by Ms in ’t Veld, which we were just dealing with, there is a huge difference. These issues have been put in the right context and are based on the very notion that competence is the decisive factor. In Europe, however, we still have some way to go until such decisions would be based on competence alone.</p>

<p class="contents">We need action, because talking is not enough. There are good examples of this: in the European Central Bank, for example, where there is not a single woman, as has been made apparent here too. I do, of course, know that in some countries, there are offices of the ombudsman for equality where there is not a single man, and so on. The basic assumption must be that men and women should be involved in decision making, and I believe that this is a way to strengthen this trend in different countries, so that equality can become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also recall that we share with him and with others an active presence in Parliament’s Social Economy Intergroup.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group, as you know, believes that the social model is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European integration project. Therefore, this is not just a simple policy, or one of many; it is a policy that characterises our entire project. In this day and age, with the attacks relating to the need for public spending cuts as well, we still firmly support this priority. We know that it may be as a revised or modified social model, but we believe that it should be retained, defended and reaffirmed as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that, in this same vision, we must also promote business entities, such as cooperatives, which produce goods and services and have a very special role in the so-called European social economy. These businesses reassert the fact that it is possible to be productive, to do good things, to be efficient even if the goal is not profit but rather, for example, employment, welfare, labour development and contributing to the life of the local community.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is important – I am finishing here, Madam President – for Europe to make the appropriate instruments available for an active policy and make a good statute – not the one that exists now, which is unusable, but a good statute for cooperatives which can be a way to help this very important sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently, while we are going through one of the most serious economic and social crises since the war, the function of cooperative societies has become crucial. It is quite clear that where there has been substantial development of the cooperative dimension in the economy, the result has been an increase in employment, more skilled labour and more equitable redistribution of the wealth generated.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is good that the European Union has adopted a statute for cooperative societies, but now more than ever, there needs to be a real simplification of the rules. We need to give new incentives for the creation of a common European framework on cooperatives and this must occur by giving assistance and not creating bureaucratic obstacles.

I would like to emphasise the important role of the cooperative experience in Italy and Europe and of its impact on the territory, in particular, during the period of crisis we are currently going through.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must regretfully note that the European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success, given its scarce use: in 2010, only 17 SCEs were registered. This should make us question the applicability of the legal framework. I believe that today, more than ever, simplification is needed to enable small organisations to access information on national provisions for implementing regulations and directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think we need to remember the commitments undertaken by the Commission, in particular, to include cooperatives among the financial instruments of the European Investment Fund and to make explicit reference to more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as easier access to loans and tax concessions. The Italian experience has shown that if cooperatives are supported by adequate instruments and concessions, they produce excellent results in terms of employment and society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know perfectly well that some cooperatives practise truly predatory behaviour, like the Finnish cooperative which just wiped M-real Alizay off the map, leaving more than 400 employees by the wayside.

However, despite the progress made with the Bologna Declaration – which, as noted, dates back to 1999 – we have got to recognise the fact that in terms of student mobility and the harmonisation of degrees across the various countries, the results have been far from satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I voted in favour of this report. We need to move forward with greater speed on this issue and reverse the trend – especially in some countries – of cutting investment in education.

The objective therein proposed by Mr Berlinguer himself – and, of course, he was one of the ministers who set this process in motion at the Sorbonne back in 1998-1999 – that all EU nationals could be on the same starting line in terms of qualifications and thus be placed in employment in different areas of the internal market and beyond, and that there should be equivalence between qualifications, is an excellent one, and we should work towards it.</p>

The British have been very keen on this, and so it now seems a bit odd that the British Tories are opposed to it.

Therefore, it is good that the Commission is preparing a ranking system that will give us detailed information about the levels of universities and their departments. In Slovakia, we have good experiences from comparisons of the quality of education and research in universities. The creation of an academic ranking agency has given not only the government, but most importantly students, a reliable tool when deciding on their future studies.

Crime has become increasingly cross-border in nature, as well as more sophisticated and interlinked. This necessitates understanding from governments and a reaction that cannot fail to include working with other subjects of international law or the articulation of joint responses. It is therefore natural that the European Union should seek to reach this type of understanding with neighbouring countries with similar histories, cultures and standards of democracy, with the rule of law, and with respect for human rights, such as Iceland and Norway. I welcome this agreement and hope that European integration in relation to these areas, which are so important for public safety and well-being, will not fail to involve Iceland and Norway increasingly, and that this involvement will produce good results in terms of both preventing and curbing crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These acts are therefore an important element in shaping the area of freedom, security and justice. The Convention and the Protocol set out the legal framework within which the relevant authorities of Member States conducting proceedings may operate, and stipulate procedural conditions and prerequisites for their adoption. These tools increase the effectiveness of procedures for holding people responsible for breaking the law and, as a consequence, provide a better guarantee of the rule of law and protect the interests of people in the area covered by the regulations. At the same time, they facilitate the realisation of the right to a trial. Extending their effectiveness to all Member States and to countries which have close ties with the EU, as well as to candidate countries, is a natural consequence of accepting the common ideas of freedom, security and justice. The agreement is another formal step toward the realisation of such ideas. Its validity is not in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Judicial cooperation on criminal matters is based on the principle of mutual recognition of sentences and court judgments by the Member States, and involves national legislation on the application of common minimum rules. As such, since they apply almost all the provisions of the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union and the 2001 Protocol thereto, legal cooperation between the Member States of the EU and Norway and Iceland is becoming a reality. The agreement in question includes provisions of great importance, such as those on hearing of witnesses, experts and accused persons by telephone or video conference, controlled deliveries, covert investigations and joint investigation teams, and requests for information on banking transactions and bank accounts and for their monitoring to combat crime in general and organised crime in particular. The adoption of this agreement represents a considerable step towards creating a genuine area of cooperation with countries outside the EU, which will have a positive impact on the Union itself, by enabling the creation of an increasingly large area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also consider positive the laying down of rules concerning the hearing of accused persons, witnesses and experts by video conference or telephone, the promotion of facilitated access to banking transactions and the creation of joint investigation teams, which will facilitate the rapid resolution of cases before the courts.

In accordance with Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the request has been analysed by the Committee on Legal Affairs. Ms Morvai was heard by the committee, which requested further information and explanations from the Pest Central District Court before issuing its opinion. Ms Morvai is accused of public defamation because she made televised statements considered offensive to the good name of a member of the public, János Zombori. The Member acknowledges having made the statements ‘in her capacity as a women’s right activist’. Since the statements were made in 2005, long before she was elected to Parliament, which only happened in 2009, they cannot have taken place ‘in the performance of her duties as Member of the European Parliament’, so they are not covered by the Statute for Members.

The mobility of citizens in the EU is increasing and, in civil and commercial legal relations involving interests in several Member States, this often leads to various questions, such as establishing which Member State court is competent to address an issue that has arisen, which legal system will be applied, and the procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, etc. The Treaty establishing the European Community sets out the objective of progressively establishing a common area of freedom, security and justice, in particular, by adopting measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters. This proposed regulation is aimed at addressing legal issues regarding cross-border succession in order to ensure greater legal clarity for EU citizens and simplicity when exercising their rights in cross-border succession cases. This regulation also introduces an important innovation – the European Certificate of Succession, which will enable heirs, administrators of the estate or executors of the will to demonstrate their status without any other formalities.

At the moment, if someone is living in a Member State other than their country of origin and owns a property in that Member State which they want to leave as an inheritance, there is the danger of a conflict arising between the courts in the relevant Member States demanding jurisdiction.

This report, drafted by Mr Lechner, concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and authentic instruments in matters of succession and the creation of a European Certificate of Succession. This is a cross-border system that constitutes an important step forward in this regard and that will enable the more effective application of the law, in line with the concerns of families. Indeed, once a decision has been made, there are no limits to the application of a judgment due to the European Certificate of Succession. I welcome the adoption of this report, which constitutes good news for thousands of European citizens: they will benefit from this initiative, which will put a stop to many conflicts.

With the aim of progressively establishing this area, it must adopt measures in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters having a cross-border reach, to the extent necessary for the market to be able to function properly. In the European area of justice, citizens must be able to organise their succession in advance. The rights of heirs and legatees, other persons having a relationship with the deceased, and the creditors of the estate must be effectively guaranteed. The accelerated, accessible and effective organisation of successions with an international element in the European Union means that heirs, legatees, executor or administrator must be able to easily, out of court, prove their status in the Member States in which the inherited property is located. In order to facilitate the free movement of such proof in the EU, an appropriate regulation should introduce a single European certificate of inheritance and specify the issuing authority.

The inheritance law of Members States is very diverse and related to local tradition, which means that cross-border proceedings are extremely complicated and confusing for the participants. The EU has 27 different legal succession systems and every year, around 450 000 international succession proceedings are opened. It is important to create a single transparent procedural system that helps Europeans to pursue their succession rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on a regulation creating common rules regarding matters of succession in the EU and the creation of a European Certificate of Succession is a very complex and ambitious project. This will not affect national rules, but will make it easier for people who own property in more than one Member State. Statistics show that around 1.5% of residents in EU Member States are citizens of other countries in the Community; they will be able to decide, based on the new provisions, in which country the future administration of their estate should take place. Furthermore, the introduction of a European Certificate of Succession, which will constitute evidence of the status of heir, recognised in the territory of all the Member States, will make it easier for holders of such a certificate to exercise their rights, resulting in shorter and less costly proceedings.</p>

The proposed regulations aim to increase legal certainty for both testators and beneficiaries. The essence of the regulation is to implement the model of a uniform status for an estate where, in relation to one estate, regardless of the nature of its contents or the location thereof, the provisions of one legal regime apply, this having been selected by the testator as the applicable law. This avoids fragmentation of the estate and reduces problems in exercising successor rights under different legal regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must consider whether the proposal fully realises the intended possibility of protecting the estate upon death. There is no doubt that the possibility of selecting the applicable law to resolve matters of succession in conjunction with the European Certificate of Succession allows for such protection. However, this is a formal aspect of this regulation, consisting of its introduction into the legal system. It has great potential. However, it depends on the material aspect of the actual opportunity for entitled persons to benefit from these institutions. We need to consider how to encourage the behaviour described by us in these provisions. This is the whole problem with the draft regulation. In addition to creating legal tools, we need to persuade entitled persons to use them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the gradual establishment of such an area, the Union is to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. The proper functioning of the internal market should be facilitated by removing the obstacles to the free movement of persons who currently face difficulties asserting their rights in the context of a succession having cross-border implications. In the European area of justice, citizens must be able to organise their succession in advance. The rights of heirs and legatees, of other persons close to the deceased, and of creditors of the succession, must be effectively guaranteed. In order to achieve those objectives, this regulation should bring together provisions on jurisdiction, on applicable law, on recognition or, as the case may be, acceptance, enforceability and enforcement of decisions, authentic instruments and court settlements and on the European Certificate of Succession.

Uniform connecting factors for determining court competence and applicable law are the nub of a European solution. Deceased persons who had been habitually resident outside their home country and who had not made a choice of law would be subject to the law on succession of the country of residence.

The new regulation aims to facilitate the execution of wills and avoid long and costly procedures if a European citizen dies in a Member State other than his home country and his will involves more than one national legal system. According to Mr Lechner, cross-border successions account for 10% of successions in the EU, at almost 450 000 per year with a value in the region of EUR 123 billion. The new European rules would also introduce a European Certificate of Succession. This could ease legal procedures and ensure that the rights of heirs are respected alongside those of the other parties involved, such as creditors. Overall, this would making the procedure quicker and clearer, while use of the certificate would be voluntary. The new regulation will not apply in cases of succession for people who stay in their home country and does not alter national legislation on succession, property or tax, nor would it entail any harmonisation of national procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be remembered that cross-border successions account for 10% of all successions in the EU. The new arrangements, which will enter into force in 2015, will expedite procedures and reduce administrative formalities for heirs by introducing harmonised criteria concerning the national law applicable to the will where the estate concerns more than one Member State (the default rule will be that of the last place of residence of the testator). It will also make it possible for people living abroad to choose their country of origin as the reference for the applicable law when drafting their will. Finally, it is worth highlighting the creation of a European Certificate of Succession, devised in order to clarify the legal situation of persons making a will and to assist heirs and creditors in proving their status and safeguarding their rights throughout the Union. I only regret that the UK and Ireland have opted out, and that it will not apply in Denmark, which will reduce the impact of the text on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that we had the opportunity today to vote on a topic that had been anticipated by citizens for a very long time. Living in the border town of Sopron, I am acutely aware of the administrative difficulties and barriers to the assertion of rights that citizens have to face more often than not in cross-border affairs. This, unfortunately, leads to diminished legal certainty, which is, however, an exceptionally important factor in respect of succession. I supported this report because with its adoption, the administration of cross-border succession cases will be significantly simplified, giving citizens a secure, predictable basis for disposing of their inheritance, thereby allowing them to save considerable amounts of time, energy and money. Although the report has not been in the spotlight of the international media, I do believe that it is votes such as this that truly show the worth of our work. The very reason for our being here as Members of the European Parliament is to discuss matters such as this and to represent the true interests of European citizens. Let us represent them instead of debating baseless, fervent accusations instigated by certain political interest groups against specific Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve a cross-cutting solution for all the Member States, it is crucial to lay down a single set of reference criteria for succession rights, specifically regarding the handover, administration and liquidation of the legitimate owner’s goods. I am voting for the submitted proposal, which guarantees increased legal certainty for citizens resident in the European Union, since the criterion of habitual residence will now be in force for the competent court to apply its own legal system. Finally, it is important to stress that no changes will be made to the normal succession process for citizens habitually resident in their country of origin who own property in that country. Property that citizens own outside their country of origin will also be covered by the legal system of their country of residence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An ever-increasing number of European citizens are moving during their life from one country to another within the EU to live, study, work or retire. The number of EU-27 citizens who are resident in a different Member State to their Member State of origin reached approximately 12.3 million in 2010, marking a rise of 3 million compared with 2005. In order to settle successions in the EU involving any cross-border aspect in a quick, easy and effective manner, heirs, legatees, executors of a will or administrators of an estate should be able to demonstrate easily their status and/or rights and powers in another Member State, for instance, in a Member State where the succession property is located. Therefore, the regulation envisages the creation of a standard certificate, the European Certificate of Succession, which will be issued for use in another Member State.

In these circumstances, it is important for Member States to adopt legislative measures aimed at providing equal, effective economic independence for men and women in Europe’s societies. One issue directly linked to this objective is that of equal pay for men and women. In the absence of sustained efforts, the 17.5% gap between the incomes earned by men and women cannot be reduced.</p>

This situation, in 2012, is unacceptable. Women across the EU earn 17.5% less on average than men. I would like to underline that women represent 60% of new university graduates but continue to be under-represented in economic decision-making posts. Indeed, within the EU, on average, only 12% of the executives of the major listed companies are women, with only 3% female chairs. In times of economic crisis, strengthening women’s position in the job market is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. For this reason, Member States must invest in affordable, high-quality facilities for the care of children, the elderly and other dependent persons, making sure that as many people as possible can combine professional and private life. I also would like to express my great concern about the legislation in some Member States which does not expressly forbid the handing of pre-signed resignation letters to employers when women are recruited, which has the effect of enabling maternity laws to be circumvented. Any further delay in that prohibition is intolerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discrimination against women persists, whether in terms of pay, the participation of women in decision making or their representation in politics. While supporting the action by Commissioner Reding, who has recently launched a consultation regarding the measures to be adopted in order to reinforce gender equality, the in ’t Veld report, which I fully endorse, seeks to go further and calls on the European Commission to propose legislation on the introduction of quotas for the executive bodies of companies in order to improve women’s representation. Quotas are never a panacea. Nevertheless, if used on a provisional basis, they can be precious tools for doing away with relics from a bygone era. Today, only 13.7% of women sit on the executive boards of listed companies in the EU. That is clearly not enough. Despite European conservative opposition, Parliament has demonstrated that it is, and will remain, fundamentally progressive on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the gradual progress in the area of gender equality, many inequalities between women and men still remain. Despite countless campaigns, targets and measures in recent years for equal pay, for equal work and work of equal value, the gender pay gap remains stubbornly wide. On average, women across the EU earn 17.5% less than men and there has only been a marginal reduction of the gender pay gap in the last few years. The Member States must therefore redouble their efforts to implement existing EU provisions with the aim of closing this gap. Violence against women still remains one of society’s most sensitive and severe problems. Therefore, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to present as a matter of urgency an EU-wide strategy to end violence against women, including a legislative criminal law instrument to combat gender-based violence as requested by Parliament in several resolutions. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to establish 2015 as the EU Year to End Violence against Women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discrimination against women in terms of payment for the same work is particularly striking, and it should be noted that it is harder for women to achieve a balance between work and family life. A fair policy of equality between women and men should be of fundamental importance not only socially, but also in terms of the economy, since it leads to the expanded production capacity of the relevant sector of the economy, and thus to an increase in the level of employment and greater competition in the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Specific binding measures are proposed in order to protect and promote women’s rights, such as pension rights, maternity and paternity leave, access to health based on the gender aspect, protection from all forms of violence and equality in pay, political representation and promotion to positions of political and economic responsibility. One basic point in the report is the reference to women’s rights regardless of their social status, age, sexual orientation or ethnicity. The Commission is also called on to implement its commitment to mainstream gender equality into the Common European Asylum System. Finally, it quite rightly notes that families are diverse and comprise married, unmarried and partnered parents, different-sex and same-sex parents, single parents and foster parents, who deserve protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has made countless proposals for combating this inequality – in particular, the Europe 2020 strategy – but progress has been too slow, unfortunately. It is even clearer at a time of economic crisis that improving the position of women in the labour market and making them more economically independent is an economic necessity, apart from being a moral imperative. Currently, 60% of new graduates are women. However, it is very difficult for them to enter professional life at their level of training and there is a wage gap that must be reduced: on average, women earn 17.5% less than men. It is also crucial to step up measures enabling the reconciliation of professional and family lives. Particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of women, who are at greater risk of social exclusion, poverty and extreme human rights violations. I call on the Member States and all stakeholders not to limit themselves to advocating the use of words to achieve gender equality, but to make all necessary efforts and take all necessary action to prioritise it in both their social and their economic strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must show respect for different cultures, traditions and religions. Issues such as parental leave, budgetary measures and political priorities in respect of equality issues should be left to the Member States to decide at national level. What we can and should do instead is increase our commitment to enabling the increased participation of women, but creating legislation on quotas at EU level is not the way forward. We want to encourage women into leadership positions in all areas, but the way to get there is via jobs and by eliminating the exclusion of many immigrant women by increasing access to jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The impact of the necessary fiscal consolidation must not fall disproportionately on the shoulders of women. There have to be clear gender dimensions to our growth and jobs strategies. I endorse the call for a European equal pay target of reducing the gender pay gap by 10% in each Member State. Gender pay differentials for work of equal value are transmitted into later generations in the form of lower pensions for women and higher poverty rates amongst older women. They need to be tackled now. I welcome the call for EU legislation, including quotas, to increase female representation on company boards to 30% by 2015 and 40% by 2020 and for legislative measures at national level to ensure balanced representation of women and men in politics. In this context, I believe we can learn from the very active participation of women at Community level, work which should be more highly valued at both national level and EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the current financial and economic climate, strengthening the position of women in the labour market is not only an ongoing moral argument but also an economic necessity. There is the ever-growing risk of poverty and social exclusion, while the austerity measures adopted by some Member States in recent years have been imposed on top of the harsh reality of a lack of support mechanisms for women, in a climate of discrimination on the labour market and in society. Measures for supporting families and children have been abolished or reduced at a time when the health care and pre-school education systems are experiencing difficulties and there is a lack of utilities and medical care in rural areas, which has resulted in a sharp decline in the living standards of families with children.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, salaries have been cut in budget sectors in which women predominantly work, such as education and health, which has led to a substantial drop in incomes.

However, this should be achieved by removing the barriers that still remain for women – such as, for example, the negative impact of motherhood on career progression – and not imposed through regulation and quotas. As I have had occasion to say numerous times, unless they are temporary, quotas only diminish women rather than guaranteeing them equal access to a profession, to public office, or to management and leadership roles in business. Moreover, in the field of private enterprise, the imposition of quotas could constitute an intervention limiting shareholder freedom and could, as such, be in breach of Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which sets out the principle of freedom to conduct a business.

The report proposes positive measures that promote economic equality and equality in working conditions between men and women. However, the European Union’s present political and social situation is an unavoidable aspect of this debate. If the so-called austerity measures advocated by the European institutions – the majority in this Parliament, in particular – are continued and enshrined in the treaties, as intended, they will lead to enormous steps backwards in terms of equality between men and women: the even further weakening of labour relations, with the watering down of the principle of collective bargaining; higher rates of unemployment; increasingly precarious jobs, which particularly affects women already; and a reduction in the public child care network, which is essential to alleviating the excessive burden that falls on women. Firmly rejecting this route, and defending and improving the rights of women workers, constitute a precondition for defending equality between men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite making every effort, gender equality has not yet been achieved in the EU. Legislation may have changed, but the traditional gender roles and gender stereotypes remain a significant obstacle to fundamental change. Economic independence for women and men is key to achieving gender equality. There is a risk that the current economic crisis will set us back a few years, since it ultimately affects women more than men.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider that efforts to improve labour market participation and access to leading positions in, say, company boardrooms must remain a high priority on the political agenda. The difference in the status of men and women in some countries outside Europe is often dramatic. Women have fewer rights, or even no rights whatsoever. The EU and Member States must do much more to bring about an improvement and to rectify this situation. What is needed is not only sufficient financial resources, but also, I firmly believe, a radical change in mentality and traditions in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the European Union leads the world in the area of gender equality, we have to bear in mind that there is still room for improvement. It is indisputable that women are under-represented in leading positions throughout Europe. It is essential to put this right.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the options available to us, we must be able to practise open assessment. There are huge differences between the Member States with regard to the position of women, so we firstly need to ensure that measures found to be positive and workable in the more advanced Member States are implemented across the Union. The impact of gender-linked factors in particular on a person’s career opportunities, such as starting a family or doing military service, must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless worrying that, even in countries which are very equal statistically or with respect to their legislation, there are obvious gender disparities in the number of those selected for positions, and particularly for managerial posts. The reasons for this need to be assessed. Without underrating the effect of the distortion caused by the ‘old boy’ networks, it is clear that an examination of the figures shows that we cannot just take into account those selected as managers compared to the entire population base: we also have to be able to see any gender disparities that might exist between those selected and numbers of applicants, and between numbers of applicants and the population base, and then arrive at the relevant conclusions. No quotas can provide any real solution, which is to say that selection of the most suitable candidates regardless of gender is the correct approach, as long as there continues to be a considerable difference between the sexes in their appetite for risk. That is why it is essential that both sexes, while still young, are also shown the importance of taking the initiative if they are to succeed in modern society.

In areas such as the economy and politics, men still hold the highest positions. It should therefore be stressed that equality between women and men is very important in order to achieve sustainable economic growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion. I would like to express my support for the reduction of gender-based wage differences, for an increase in the role of women in decision-making processes at all levels, and for the fight against gender-based discrimination and violence. I also believe that we should pay more attention to countries outside the European Union, where women have fewer or no rights. In connection with the above, I support the European Parliament’s resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union and voted for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not suggesting a ban on two people of the same sex living freely together, but the family is something else altogether and it must therefore have different guarantees and protective measures. The meaning of the terms ‘family’ and ‘parenthood’ derive from the very concept of humanity: indeed, only a union between a man and a women can lead to the conception of a new life and the continuance of the human race. We do not want to give in to these new ideas, which have sprung from nothing in recent years: human history and human nature cannot and must not be altered. Lastly, I would like to emphasise that the title of the report talked about equality between men and women, while all these references added to the text seem to be entirely different in content and significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, an opportunity has once again been missed. The true meaning of this resolution has instead been twisted into a demagogic wasteland in an attempt to make everyone happy, while actually not pleasing anyone, and going so far as to even deal with the adoption of children by same-sex couples, while lamenting the definition of the family and parenthood as ‘too restrictive’ in some Member States.

Today, it is clear that while the work that has been done to ensure gender equality is yielding results, it is doing so slowly. In order to ensure women’s active participation and full involvement in social life, politics and the labour market, bolder and more binding methods must be implemented than those that have been implemented hitherto. Before the implementation of such methods (for instance, election quotas, quotas regarding the representation of women on the boards of large publicly traded companies, etc.), however, a better overview must be obtained of the degree to which women are represented in different types of companies and of the voluntary or compulsory measures that have already been implemented. In addition to the gathering and presentation of such data, I consider that we should demand an analysis in all Member States of wages earned for equal or equivalent work (in addition to a comparison of average wages), for which purpose guidelines for the evaluation of equal or equivalent work must also be prepared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States should, as a matter of urgency, draw up legislative plans for the regulation of maternity and paternity leave in order to respond to the needs of European families and the European economy.

As the rapporteur pointed out, in the EU Member States, on average, only 12% of the executives of major listed companies are women, with only 3% female chairs. Furthermore, women earn 17%, and in Lithuania 19%, less than men for the same work. As mentioned in the debates, more progress has been made where the Member States have set quotas and other legally binding measures, and there is a much greater guarantee of gender equality. It is therefore essential to take action at both national and European level so that women have greater opportunities to participate in decision making in the public and private sectors and we need to improve the position of women in the labour market and increase their economic independence to reach a 75% employment rate for men and women in the EU by 2020.

It is vital to collect comprehensive data on female representation in the Union in order to be able to assess the measures taken by the business sector of the Member States with the aim of increasing this representation. The use of quotas is an effective tool and is still a necessity to increase female representation, given that it leads to advancements towards gender equality and somewhat alleviates the consequences of the economic crisis for women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, this afternoon’s vote on the report by Sophia in ’t Veld on equality between men and women in the European Union in 2011 is important. Whilst there is no shortage of goodwill, mentalities have changed little and the ‘glass ceiling’ is as tough as ever.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support two of the published priorities. The first aims at ending violence against women. Its everyday occurrence in all forms (physical, sexual, mental or economic) is worrying. In Belgium, domestic violence is the number one cause of death amongst women aged 15 to 44. The other priority concerns the objective of equal pay for women and men for the same work and the same qualifications. There is no justification for women earning 17.5% less, on average, than their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the policy on quotas advanced in the report. Even applied in small doses to corporate management bodies, I do not think that offsetting <span class="italic">de facto</span> inequality with legal inequality would be the right solution and one that would lead to a real change in mentalities.

The economic independence of men and women is key to gender equality. The current economic crisis risks putting us back years, as it may ultimately hit women harder than men. So, efforts to improve labour market participation, and access to positions of power such as company boards, need to stay high on the agenda. The gap between the position and status of women and men in some countries outside Europe is often dramatic. Women have fewer rights or no rights at all.

<p class="contents">Another thing that confirms still further my choice to vote against the report is that it aims to guarantee the reproductive rights of women, regardless of their sexual orientation. This would mean that men who feel like women would be given the chance to have children or even adopt them. The report also contemplates the idea that families do not only include married parents, but also same-sex parents, thereby allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. A report that could have garnered comprehensive support for the rightful recognition of women’s rights has been transformed into a nonsensical series of statements about the presumed rights of so-called same-sex families who want the option to adopt children. I think that the family – in the strict sense of the word – can only be considered as such when it comprises a man and a women and any children they may have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the gender pay gap may reach 25% in a few years, unless appropriate measures are taken. The gender pay gap is more visible in the private sector where women are paid less than men for doing the same job. A report published by the Institute for the Study of Labour states that in the EU, the gender pay gap problem is not just a glass ceiling issue but also a sticky floor problem. For example, the gender pay gap is greater both among the highest earners and the lowest paid in Lithuania. In order to improve the situation, there should be more transparent pay scales in companies and more severe measures against companies that fail to comply with the principle of gender equality. Faced with the crisis, there should be an even greater focus on economic equality. Lower wages for women inevitably mean not just lower incomes, but lower pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time for the political parties to accept their responsibilities and to recognise the extent of their role as key actors in the promotion of parity. Nevertheless, regardless of what national situations may be, the Member States should consider introducing legislative measures, such as positive action measures, as well as also implementing effective sanctions.

I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission to look into the fact that these percentages appear to be static and that no improvements are being seen. This phenomenon could be explained by the traditional barriers that women face, such as the lack of financial resources, stereotypes, and difficulties in managing family and political life. I therefore support one of the measures put forward by the rapporteur, which involves designing and implementing effective strategies at EU and national level for increasing women’s engagement and participation in decision making and leadership, through quantified targets, regular monitoring mechanisms and clear action plans. I also think that active and tangible measures should be promoted in order to ensure gender balance in all governing bodies and public appointments.

Moreover, the Council, the Commission and the Member States should enforce parity at all levels by sending clear anti-discrimination messages, by providing appropriate resources, by using specific tools, and by promoting necessary training for civil servants responsible for preparing budgets in gender budgeting. In its report, the European Parliament also calls on the Council, Commission and Member States to enable women and men to take an active part in political decision making by promoting reconciliation and a balance between family life and working life by means of measures such as sharing the costs of parenthood equally between both parents’ employers and ensuring accessible and adequate care services for children and the elderly, for instance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate that this report calls on political parties in the Member States to adopt measures for the greater participation of women in politics, but I do not agree with the call to establish quotas. On the contrary, I am a supporter of looser forms of regulation in the form of targets and more general rules for determining the ordering of candidate lists for national elections and elections at EU level. One possible incentive might be an obligation for parties to fulfil certain targets in the area of equal representation as a precondition for the granting of funds to the party.

Gender balance is a question of equality, but also a guarantee of a better quality of democracy, since it contributes to decisions in which there is greater diversity and participation. The European Union’s commitment to this cause has been well known, particularly through measures like the ‘Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015’. This report emphasises traditional obstacles to women accessing public posts, such as financial difficulties, a predominantly male culture, reconciling family and political life, and the stereotypes that still predominate in the media. As such, there is a need for concrete and structural measures to make the political participation of women a clear reality, particularly through a commitment to training, guaranteed equality of opportunity in accessing campaigns and presenting a positive image of women as leaders. The political parties also have a crucial role to play in combating the under-representation of women in political decision-making assemblies across the EU Member States. I am therefore voting for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more significant when we consider that women account for almost 50% of the workforce and that more than 50% of recent graduates are women. This inequality casts a shadow over the majority of Member States, as well as at European level. In this Parliament, 35% of Members are women, whilst one third of the Commissioners are female. These are positive signs that need urgent encouragement to become more widespread. The persistent under-representation of women constitutes a democratic deficit, with the end result being that the legitimacy of decision making at national and EU level is weakened.

It is by educating our children and young people that we can change the view of the role of women in the long term and overcome stereotypes. Men and women must have the same opportunities when it comes to political decision making, and appointments must be made on the basis of merit, not gender. Quota systems and dictating from above will not resolve the imbalance. The way to make progress must instead be based on freedom of choice. Financial independence is the way to equality.

While use of a quota system could jeopardise selection based on the principle of merit, it has nevertheless contributed to this increase.

It is these structural problems, which are expressions of class inequalities, that need to be combated.

Simply by way of example, women are still under-represented in political decision-making assemblies across the European Member States, accounting for just 24% of members in national parliaments with varying – but all equally disheartening – percentages in the Member States. Even though theoretical equality has already been achieved in our legal systems, there are still many insidious cultural and practical barriers that too often prevent women from realistically aspiring to the positions of responsibility held by men. What goes in politics applies equally to the public administration, private business, teaching and the armed forces, and in all walks of society that involve a measure of responsibility and prestige.

In this respect, measures have already been adopted in some Member States, but there is a considerable imbalance on the whole. I feel that electoral systems which take into account gender equality are a positive development, and I think that the actions in favour of this should be continued. I support the stance that specific measures need to be implemented to achieve equality when it comes to elected offices in national parliaments and the European Parliament because the level of representation of women in these bodies is currently less than a quarter for the EU. The same problem also applies with regard to gender equality in the executive of Member States and the European Commission.

Gender equality in decision making is a question of quality and equality. There is no doubt that more balanced gender participation contributes to more diversified and better decisions. Women are still under-represented in all European Member States. This is down to a number of factors, including: a lack of financial resources, a predominantly male culture, stereotypes, and difficulties in managing family and political life. Through this report, we are aiming to encourage national parties to put measures in place to increase women’s participation.</p>

National parties should implement quota systems in those electoral systems where applicable and apply rank ordering rules to electoral candidate lists for regional, national and EU elections.

Instead of carrying out an objective analysis of the situation and proposing sensible, practical measures, it has deteriorated into a left-wing feminist tract. In addition to completely disregarding the subsidiarity of the Member States’ authority, it calls for mandatory quotas for women in management positions (boards of directors, supervisory boards, etc.). This type of measure is otherwise only familiar to us in the context of communist dictatorships and it contradicts the principle of private autonomy. Companies and other organisations, including public bodies and political parties, must be free to choose the person they appoint to a particular position. The decision should be made primarily on the basis of qualifications and not gender. Quotas for lists of candidates for European, national and regional elections are not practical because some Member States do not use the system of proportional representation, and they also make no sense. We must not restrict the freedom of voters to make their own decisions. They can use a preferential vote, for example, to choose the candidate they want. In addition, the various parties have different structures. A party with a majority of female members will nominate more women and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.

However, it also marks the start of a journey towards modernity. Allow me to explain: for us, modernity does not mean women’s quotas being enforced on Member States, regional authorities and so on down to company boards of directors. The women we support in politics are not simply puppets put up for election just to comply with regulations, but people who have made a conscious and deliberate decision to play an active part in politics. To these motivated, passionate women who manage their family lives, social lives and professional lives so that they might help to build a better society, whether public or private, we give our backing and the means to follow their inspiration. In some Italian regions, if two candidates are being voted for, then one of them must be a woman.

This under-representation is a reflection of the structural discrimination against women in capitalist society. Women are mainly responsible for child-rearing and caring duties and are more likely to take time out of work to fulfil these roles. This leads to discrimination against working women who are less likely to gain promotions, leading to women being concentrated in lower-paid and precarious jobs. Sexism and stereotyping is also a real and serious barrier to women in capitalist society and impacts on women taking leading positions in organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I abstained on the separate votes in this report on gender quotas. I do not believe that gender quotas will fundamentally alter discrimination against women in capitalist society. To tackle this discrimination there need to be measures such as state-run, quality, free child care, together with state investment in public services, a significant increase in the minimum wage, the right to a living wage, paid maternity and paternity leave. Quotas will, at best, just give an image of equality without altering the reality for millions of working-class and poor women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that political parties, which have the authority to compile lists of election candidates, have the biggest role to play in solving this problem. The compilation of gender-balanced lists of election candidates is of decisive importance in ensuring that women have equal access to leading positions in society. In addition to its effectiveness, the implementation of voluntary, agreed or compulsory quotas in the compilation of lists of election candidates is also the least painful way to raise women to a position where they can compete equally with men – no men are deprived of their positions by the introduction of quotas, but women are instead given a fairer starting position in relation to men. In addition to quotas, awareness campaigns regarding the inequality between women and men and its manifestations can help overturn deep-rooted and outdated gender stereotypes. It is still a common view (among men and even among women themselves) that equality between the genders is a pseudo-problem. This societal attitude is, for instance, intensified by the misinterpretation of the topics of the wage gap or gender quotas in the media. As a result, we should allocate additional funds for education and awareness on the issue of gender inequality, for instance, through campaigns. As a result of improved awareness and women’s equal competitive opportunities, we can achieve fairer participation for women in political decision making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Establishing a work-life balance is recognised at EU level as an important priority for achieving gender equality and facilitating the opportunities for women to take part in political life. The Commission and Member States must design and implement effective gender equality policies and strategies aimed at achieving parity in terms of participation in political decision making and leadership at all levels, especially in the areas of macro-economic policy, trade, labour, budgets, defence and foreign affairs.

As such, there is a need to pursue affirmative action in this area, specifically by adopting special temporary measures intended to speed up the establishment of genuine equality between men and women, in order that the proportion of political posts occupied by women might be similar to that in Scandinavian countries.

We need actively to influence attitudes to women and gender roles, and the stereotypes associated with them. This process must begin at school. It is especially important to provide children with diverse role models to support their development. Women should be encouraged to get involved in politics from an early age. It is also important to monitor the media closely, to be able to identify cases of gender discrimination, and to be able to do something more positive about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have voted in favour of the report as it proposes a change to the current situation and promotes gender parity in decision-making processes. For this objective to be achieved, there should be direct involvement of the political parties in Europe through the introduction of quota systems for candidate lists and elections, for example, or through a system that alternates the first position on the list between female and male candidates. The report also stresses the need for national parliaments and the European Parliament to adopt specific measures to promote gender parity. I believe that the Commission’s actions to this effect represent great progress. To ensure that these actions are implemented satisfactorily, however, resources have to be provided to the political parties that wish to undertake campaigns to promote greater female participation in decision making. Given that next year will be devoted to European citizens, it is a tremendous opportunity to promote and fund actions that defend women’s rights in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quota regulations are never satisfactory. Voluntary changes would be a better solution in every case. However, during many years of political activity in this area, I have realised that the so-called ‘old boy’ networks can only be broken down by introducing quotas. It is true that these networks are not established in order to keep women out of management positions. Instead, they develop automatically in the course of people’s careers. However, their effect is precisely that. Women find it difficult to penetrate these circles. I am also in favour of legal authorisation for abortion. In this case, too, it would be better if abortions did not take place. However, the reality is somewhat different. Therefore, women must be guaranteed a certain level of legal certainty. If we were not to do this, the consequence would not necessarily be fewer abortions. Instead, women would go to third countries for abortions where there are no controls and, in some cases, not even proper medical standards.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of women who are politically active is growing, and women’s issues occupy an increasingly important place in the programmes of political parties. Nevertheless, women do not enjoy parity in political decision making. In EU countries, on average, there is one woman for every four members of the national parliament and government; in the business world, the proportion of women to men is lower at each decision-making level, and the situation is similar in the science and research sector. Gender disparities in this sector are considered to be the main obstacle to achieving greater competitiveness and to maximising potential in the science sector globally. The need for balanced representation of women and men is not just a feminist political slogan, but a necessity. Without parity, policies cannot be efficient and effective. Equal participation of women and men leads to better results in the public sphere, and creates better, more balanced decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Only greater involvement of women in politics can ensure that expenditure under state and local budgets is structured properly, because – contrary to appearances – budgets are gender sensitive. Diversity contributes to improved quality in decision-making processes, in terms of diversity of opinions, style of politics and ideas. This cannot be achieved without sufficient participation in politics by different groups, including, in particular, parity of women’s participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are still too many reasons behind this disturbing phenomenon. Discriminatory party nomination procedures are often an obstacle to women’s involvement in politics, closing the door to politics for women at the very outset. It is extremely difficult to balance public life with family life, responsibility for which still lies mostly with women. This needs to change; we need to take action to promote women’s participation in politics, for the benefit of us all. Statutory quotas are undoubtedly a catalyst for change in our society, in particular, those connected with the perception of women’s role in society. We must strive to achieve a breakthrough level of 30%. When the participation of women in a parliament, board or any other kind of organisational unit exceeds 30%, women begin to be treated equally, because 30% female participation in a group means that the visible gender division disappears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Gender balance is guaranteed in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The purpose of gender equality is to provide better political representation for women. Women’s representation in political decision making has stagnated in recent years, with the gender imbalance in national parliaments across the EU remaining unchanged (24% women and 76% men), with women accounting for only 23% of ministers. The Nordic countries have the highest level of female representation in national parliaments, with 42.3%. In the European Parliament, 35% of members are women and 65% men. I call on the Commission to submit a yearly report to the European Parliament on the progress of gender equality in political decision making in the European Union.

In order to solve this problem, it advocates the introduction of quota systems promoting parity in these areas. We believe women’s political participation is about the various areas of women’s lives: their participation in organisations, trades unions and culture, and in their daily lives. Women have greater difficulties participating in these areas owing to problems accessing education and culture, but also due to the economic difficulties that are the immediate result of the wage inequalities of which they are victims. Moreover, the result of precarious jobs is that they have little time for social and political participation. The lack of public child care services is another factor contributing to the overburdening of women. It is these structural inequalities that should be combated rather than establishing artificial equality, whilst keeping the real problems of the majority of women off limits. Furthermore, we do not accept any intervention in parties’ internal affairs, as advocated in items 5, 6 and 7; this is a matter that concerns only their members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The context of this own-initiative report is the release of the latest Commission communication on this issue, published in February 2011. Equality between men and women constitutes one of the fundamental principles of EU law and that is the commitment that needs to be renewed, thereby consolidating gender equality in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, this report tackles very sensitive issues, such as mutual recognition of civil unions and families comprising same-sex couples, abortion, the role of women in political decision making and the use of quotas, and even the Maternity Leave Directive. I therefore believe there is a long way to go in this regard, given that the strategy for achieving the proposed objectives also involves there genuinely being greater concentration and focus on the issue of equality between men and women in the European Union, distracting us from other issues that, while related, could nevertheless obscure the true scale of this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperative societies play an important role in boosting development of rural areas as well as social, economic and territorial cohesion. There are 160 000 cooperatives in the EU with around 5.4 million employees. However, only a small proportion of these cooperatives have chosen the Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE). By 2010, only 17 SCEs had been established in the whole of the EU, with 32 employees. Such a situation is unsatisfactory because cooperatives and other social economy enterprises are an important part of the European social model and they must be recognised and supported at Member State and EU level. The adoption of the SCE in 2003 is a major step facilitating the development of such companies in the EU, but its revision has revealed that it is not entirely suited to the specific circumstances of cooperative societies. I welcome the report’s calls for the existing Statute to be reviewed and amended so that it meets the needs of the market and for an autonomous and clear legal framework for SCEs to be established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Statute was not adapted to the special characteristics of the SCE, it is essential to revise the corresponding regulation in order to guarantee fair competition between cooperative societies and investor-driven companies, and to contribute to the development of the transnational activities of cooperative societies. Through this report, I support the call for EU policies in all areas to recognise the specificities and added value of social economy enterprises, especially SCEs, by adapting the legislation on public procurement, State aid and the Financial Regulation accordingly.

Cooperatives are an important pillar of the European economy and a key driver for social innovation because they help to preserve infrastructure and local services, above all, in rural areas and conurbations. At present, legislation regarding cooperatives and employee participation varies substantially across the European Union and the Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE) is, thus far, the social economy’s only legal instrument at EU level. The European Parliament highlights the potential of the SCE for promoting gender equality through the implementation of policies and programmes at various levels, paying particular attention to education, vocational training, action to promote entrepreneurship and ongoing training programmes. Furthermore, gender equality in decision making at various levels is economically beneficial and also creates favourable conditions enabling skilled and talented people to carry out management and supervisory duties. Some aspects of cooperative work provide flexibility that makes it easier to reconcile family and professional life; therefore, the Commission should design a mechanism for the exchange of the best gender equality practices between the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In almost every Member State, the transposition process has been carried out by adopting legislative provisions preceded by a consultation with the social partners, using procedures that have reflected the specific conventions in each country. The cooperative movement has been involved in this procedure in most Member States. The main way to achieve this objective is by means of an agreement negotiated between the management of the companies involved and the workers’ representatives. If they fail to reach an agreement after six months (which may be extended by common consent to 12 months), the directive stipulates a number of reference provisions.

Cooperatives have the potential to help towards completion of the EU single market, and we should therefore eliminate existing cross-border obstacles in order to boost their competitiveness. Unfortunately, the European cooperative society (SCE) project, created in 2003, is not yet a success, given its limited use – by 2010, only 17 SCEs had been set up, with a total of 32 employees. This modest figures show the Statute to be poorly suited to the specific circumstances of cooperative societies in Europe, even though entrepreneurs have expressed an interest in setting up SCEs. I welcome the fact that an in-depth assessment of the Statute has been conducted in order to ascertain why it has proven unattractive, why it has had such little impact and what can be done to overcome the lack of experience in implementation and other obstacles. Unfortunately, use of the SCE is often restricted to second-degree cooperatives consisting of legal persons only, by mutual societies which lack a European statute but wish to use a legal status associated with the social economy, and by large companies. For the small cooperative societies which constitute the major part of the cooperative movement in Europe, access to the SCE remains difficult, and the EU should therefore take steps to improve the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document urgently calls the Commission for greater concern as regards to the SCEs by asking measures to have the implementation of Directive 2003/72/EC supplementing the Statute for a cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees respected by the Member States, and by stressing the disappointing scarcity of funds that are minimising the impact of SCEs.

There are currently over 160 000 cooperatives in Europe, employing around 5.4 million people and guaranteeing local supply, particularly in rural areas. During the present economic and financial crisis, in which we have witnessed an unprecedented decline in public spending and significantly increased rates of unemployment, a social model for the economy founded on cooperatives is of benefit to society. In reality, cooperatives, which are not-for-profit, do not just supply goods and services at more competitive prices, but they also promote programmes of education, vocational training and lifelong learning, as well as fostering entrepreneurship. I therefore support the proposal that the Commission launch the ‘European Year of Social Economy’ and welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted, which not only acknowledges the role of cooperatives in economic growth and job creation, but also encourages the expansion of their scope and number, with a view to achieving the targets set in the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since we are talking about some kind of attractiveness of a legal form, the financial and economic crisis has shown that it cannot be addressed from the sole point of view of shareholders, but that the responsibilities of an enterprise as a social organisation should be taken into account. Legal regulations on cooperatives and employee participation across the EU are fundamentally different. The Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE) is, thus far, the only social economy legal form available at EU level. As a result, the SCE is closely interlinked with the directive supplementing the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to employee involvement. Some Member States have transposed articles of the directive relatively successfully, others less so.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be appropriate for the Commission to develop instruments to facilitate the ownership of cooperatives by employees and users. The participation of employees in enterprises should be taken for granted in all EU Member States and there should be greater employee participation in cross-border forms of enterprise rather than remaining at the lowest level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, quite obviously, there is the meagre number of societies created since the entry into force of the directive. Given the insufficient number of workers involved in them and in light of the results of the Commission’s research, you can see that there is a basic lack of interest in this area. Secondly, the feasibility of these societies is seriously hindered by the diversity of the economies and legal frameworks of the Member States, which prevents the necessary harmonisation for creating trans-European societies. Lastly, the report holds that these societies are a paragon of social economy and stand in contrast to the capitalist system, which could help Europe get out of this crisis. I disagree on this argument and it has been proved wrong by research undertaken in Italy, where such societies were created for the sole purpose of simplifying the administrative requirements of company management.

We therefore need to simplify this instrument, which is the only social economy legal form available at EU level. We also need to make it more user-friendly and better applicable in order to guarantee the rights of information, consultation and participation to all employees.

For those few SCE cooperatives that already exist, however, it is important that the rights of the workers are strengthened.

A revision of the directive should address the specific needs of employees in cooperatives, including the option to be both owner and employee of the same enterprise. I believe that owing to its complexity, the Statute only partially meets the needs of cooperatives and that it should be simplified, made intelligible to all and easier to apply, thus ensuring the rights of information, consultation and participation of all employees without affecting the quality of the Statute. The Statute should provide for an autonomous legal framework for SCEs alongside existing national law on cooperatives and direct harmonisation would therefore not take place.

I am even more surprised as the European cooperative offers significant potential for economic growth, combining as it does the traditional values of cooperative participation and employee involvement.

It is good that we are focusing specifically on the subject of cooperatives in the European Parliament, as this is the International Year of Cooperatives. In the European Union, there are around 160 000 cooperatives, which are owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans and employ about 5.4 million people. In my home region of Bavaria alone, there are over 1 200 cooperatives and cooperative enterprises with more than 2.7 million members. Cooperatives are one of the cornerstones of our economy. Their achievements are even more obvious in times of crisis, because cooperatives involve taking joint responsibility. For example, during the financial crisis, cooperative banks demonstrated how sustainable and resilient they are as a result of their cooperative business model. They have not lost billions in the crisis like other banks. On the contrary, their balance sheets show an increase in revenue and growth. They provide 5.4 million high-quality, crisis-proof jobs throughout Europe. Cooperatives have their roots in the regions where they are located. They represent a model for the future, for our regions and for Europe. If we promote the cooperative model as part of EU development policy, we can make a contribution which will really help people, actively involve them and encourage them to be independent.

However, by 8 May 2010, there were only 17 SCEs registered in nine Member States, none of which had a significantly large number of workers. Although the 21 million SMEs in the EU are a major asset to sustainable growth and creating jobs, the difficulty SMEs have in accessing funding is a considerable obstacle preventing them from launching new products, strengthening their infrastructures and taking on more employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, Member States need to foster conditions which are more conducive to providing access to loans and tax incentives. In actual fact, providing SMEs with access to funding is a principal objective proposed by the Commission as part of the 12 levers to boost growth and strengthen the confidence of citizens by ‘working together to create new growth’, included in the Single Market Act. The key action proposed by the Commission involves implementing legislation intended to facilitate the possibility of venture capital funds set up in one Member State investing in any other Member State without any barriers or supplementary conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperatives are an important pillar of the European economy and a key driver for social innovation and thus, in particular, preserve infrastructure and local services specifically in rural areas and conurbations. Europe has 160 000 cooperatives, owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans, which provide work for around 5.4 million employees. Cooperative banks have shown high levels of sustainability and resilience during the financial crisis, thanks to their cooperative business model. Thanks to their cooperative business model, they increased turnover and growth during the crisis with less bankruptcies and redundancies. Cooperative enterprises also provide high-quality, inclusive and crisis-resilient employment, often with high ratios of female and migrant employment and contribute towards the sustainable economic and social development of an area by providing local, non-relocatable jobs. Cooperatives can be seen as a successful and contemporary approach to the social economy and can contribute to providing secure employment prospects and allow employees to plan their life flexibly at their place of origin, especially in rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Conservatives, we have a strong belief, for example, in the huge benefits of communities working together and indeed the invaluable work of the voluntary sector and the social economy. While we strongly believe in the completion of the single market and any effort to improve cross-border business activity, we have a number of concerns with the Statute for a European cooperative society. First, in addition to its complex and bureaucratic nature, most firms who choose to operate as a cooperative tend to be anchored within their own local community and not on a pan-European level. The purpose of a cooperative is, after all, to serve the members who participate directly in the democratic management of the firm. Secondly, an overwhelming majority of cooperatives are small businesses operating within national borders and therefore, there is very little advantage to or added value from a European Statute. Taking these concerns into account, along with a number of recommendations within this report for new measures at European level, including calls for a European Year of Social Economy, we have decided to abstain from this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Statute is entirely necessary to facilitate the development of the transnational activities of cooperatives, ensuring that they are not faced with administrative burdens.

This report thus proposes simplifying it and making it more user-friendly so that it becomes more attractive, but without undermining the rights of employees.

Our key points were maintained. These included: the importance of cooperatives and other social economy enterprises as part of the European social model with 160 000 cooperatives for around 5.4 million employees; strong criticism of the Commission for lack of resources (staff, coordination, activities) and action in the field, with a call for urgent improvement; the need for EU policies in all areas to recognise/respect the specificities and added value of social economy enterprises; criticism of the shortcomings of the Statute (SCE) and its lack of use with a call for more action/improvements; and an insistence that all stakeholders be involved in the revision process on the future of the Statute. The social economy stakeholders have followed the report attentively and fed into this. Sven Giegold has been seen as one of the key actors in this field. He called for an open method of coordination for the social economy, for a European Year of Social Economy and for better business support measures (consulting, training, funding access), especially for employee buy-outs. He stressed how Parliament’s recommendations on cooperatives were being largely ignored by the Commission and recalled that Parliament had previously called for the specificities to be recognised, the SME Observatory to include social economy enterprises in its surveys, for better dialogue and for a better legal framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the majority of the submitted report, since I consider it crucial to acknowledge the role played by cooperatives and other companies of the social economy in building the European social model and the single market. I also agree that there should be more encouragement for workers to participate in the active life of companies. However, I would express my opposition to the adoption of quotas of 30% women at senior management levels and on the boards of public and listed companies by 2015 and 40% by 2020, since I do not consider this the proper way to promote the merit, ability and knowledge acquired by women over the years.

It is also true that the ways in which cooperatives are managed should create fairer and more equitable means of redistributing these organisations’ products across their members and workers. As such, we consider it positive that the report demonstrates the importance of the transposition by the Member States of the directive’s articles concerning workers’ rights, and that measures are being taken to encourage the development potential of cooperatives, particularly today, in times of economic crisis.

I do not deny the success that has been achieved, but I also completely agree with Mr Berlinguer when he talks about ‘unfinished governance’. Essentially, we cannot fail to notice the many barriers to mobility faced by students, not only in territorial terms, but also horizontally (between degree cycles) and vertically (within degree cycles), and especially in the recognition of diplomas and qualifications.

I am of the opinion that the objective of the report to ensure compatible higher education that is also attractive to third-country students is an important step towards the mobility of employees with appropriate language competences. This type of mobility can substantially reduce unemployment, including, in particular, frictional unemployment. Furthermore, it should be noted that the forms of cooperation resulting from this process make a major contribution to the exchange and practical use of experience, and to research and development. It is therefore especially important for the higher education institutions of Member States to be able to engage in suitable cooperation with their third-country counterparts as well, an additional reason for this being that such relations promote the preservation and proliferation of culture. It is very important to make quality education and the opportunities provided by the Bologna process accessible to citizens in all Member States.

Education plays a key role in providing European citizens with access to an internal market without barriers. The Bologna process provides some generally recognised benefits, such as the introduction of transferable ECTS credits and facilitating the recognition of diplomas in every EU country, a step which will therefore also allow professional qualifications to be recognised within the EU. I am pleased to note the achievements of this process which has provided many young people with the opportunity to study in different EU countries. I think that the reforms aimed at implementing it need to be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with the ideas expressed by the rapporteur, and I support increasing the number of beneficiaries receiving grants to study abroad, making it easier for the qualifications obtained to be recognised and extending these programmes within the post-university system as well. I am aware of the importance of education and the effects that gaps in the system could cause. The youth unemployment rate is the clearest indicator of this. This is why I support the EU contributing and getting involved as much as it can, so as to ensure that our children have the best possible academic future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Drawing up a common European framework that will enable international and Europe-wide recognition of university degrees awarded in the countries taking part in the process, on the basis of an efficient system for certifying the quality of higher education on offer, is a necessary reform in the process of EU harmonisation. Indeed, increased standardisation of <span class="italic">curricula vitae</span> would contribute to mutual recognition in the labour market and thereby facilitate graduate mobility. Above all, this is a key way to encourage enterprises to get involved in university science programmes and also to convince the Member States to dedicate at least 3% of their gross domestic product to education and science during this time of crisis. I think it is also worth noting the fact that the final agreement emphasises the need to boost funding for public and private universities alike, with the ultimate goal of increasing access to higher education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Bologna process has made it possible for Europe’s higher education systems to be compatible, and has enabled the removal of still existing barriers to cross-border mobility. However, its application has not been successful in all the Member States, both because of the current situation of economic crisis and because of the lack of mechanisms for keeping all those involved in higher education informed, and for monitoring and supporting them. Reinforcing this process is essential to realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. There is an urgent need for all the Member States to be involved, whether by increasing the budget or by fully implementing already existing European programmes, such as the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System. I am voting for this report because I believe the measures provided for therein will contribute to the successful implementation of the Bologna process, with undeniable benefits for the European higher education system, and all its students, academics and officials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘competitiveness / mobility / employability’ triptych is designed to create a flexible scientific workforce without protected labour and professional rights; at the same time, it reinforces class barriers in higher education by opposing the free State education that they should provide. The Bologna process turns education from a public good into a commodity and homogenises diplomas and courses, on the basis of market needs, rather than social needs. At the same time, the ECTS system for first degrees (bachelor’s), the procedure proposed for post-graduate studies (master’s degree), and lifelong learning programmes such as those proposed, is an attempt to alter the global, scientific knowledge provided to young scientists by providing them simply with fragmented and specialist knowledge based solely on the interests of their employers. Finally, the text conceals the fact that all the reforms being applied within the framework of the neoliberally-oriented Bologna process are resulting in under-funding of scientific research in the EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret that some European universities seem reluctant to contribute to strengthening the EHEA, which is crucial to increasing the competitiveness and quality of the knowledge they produce. I agree that the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System should be more transparent and provide the possibility of establishing more precise comparisons between qualifications and degrees.

Unfortunately, this reform is unfinished, which is very much because of a lack of genuine involvement from all the stakeholders – the education sector/legislators – in implementing the Bologna process. The rapporteur identifies a number of problems. First off, the top-down approach; that is, the imposition on universities by the Member States/the EU of models developed in advance without the full involvement of the main players in the education process. Other problems identified are the lack of links between higher education establishments and the labour market, higher education students’ lack of mobility within the EU, and the problems with mutual recognition of university degrees within Europe. Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis can currently be added to the aforementioned problems, which has led many Member States to cut their education budgets. Nevertheless, I consider reinforcing the Bologna process absolutely crucial to achieving the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy.

In 1998, on the occasion of the 800th anniversary of the University of Paris, a group of European ministers signed the Sorbonne Declaration, with the intention of harmonising the European higher education system. On 19 June 1999, 30 European countries signed the Bologna Declaration, the objective of which was to establish, by 2010, a European Higher Education Area that is coherent, compatible, competitive and attractive to students from Europe and third countries; an area that promotes European cohesion through the knowledge, mobility and employability of its graduates, so as to ensure that Europe will perform better in the world. Through the mutual recognition of academic qualifications by the various universities of the signatory countries, the Bologna process enables the greater mobility of persons, in general, and students, in particular. I welcome the adoption of this report and I am sure it will be a major incentive to continuing this process and that it will contribute to achieving the objectives of Education and Training 2020 and the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Education as a right that should be guaranteed to all, irrespective of individual financial circumstances, has been called into question. The role of the education system in overcoming social inequalities has been called into question, replaced by a knowledge ‘market’ and a new business opportunity that ensure the reproduction of social inequalities. Those are some of the consequences of the Bologna process. The proclaimed objective of student mobility has fallen by the wayside, since mobility rates are low, as the report itself acknowledges. The harmonisation of curricula ignores the specific characteristics of each country’s education system, in a trend towards training for the workplace rather than integrated education. Quality is declining and many students are obliged to indebt themselves in order to access a fundamental right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Intergovernmental cooperation and the strategies set out by the European institutions have been the stimulus for a far-reaching structural reform of the European higher education system. European universities have deeply revised and reorganised their teaching activities, while also strengthening their social role.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be noted, however, that the connection between this system and the labour market has not always been successful. For this reason, the strengthening of the whole Bologna process is of fundamental significance. The first goal of the Bologna process remains the basic requirement that every student enrolled in a European university has the right to complete his studies and to see his qualification recognised across the EU. The European institutions and the Member States play a crucial role here, especially in the recognition of qualifications and mobility policy. At this stage, however, the EHEA is not fully developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that it is important to enhance its potential to the maximum and to address the many open questions such as the role of government regulation, budgetary constraints, quality control, and national accreditation. Consequently, those participating in the Bologna process – universities, students, teachers, trade unions, the business sector – have a crucial responsibility to ensure that the process is actually rooted in the academic body concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These obstacles make it harder to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy concerning the creation of a knowledge-driven, innovative economy. Thanks to the Bologna system, we can speak of a European higher education system, and I consider this to be a huge achievement in our progress towards the compatibility of education systems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bologna process is a challenge because it initiated enormous changes. Education reform has not only enabled students to make use of educational programmes at foreign universities, but also increases the role played by universities in society. It is now important to strengthen the Bologna system in order to make it possible to realise in full the proposal that a student who studies at a given university is entitled to receive a degree, and that his qualification should be recognised throughout the EU. In other words, we have to create a learning-friendly environment and increase student mobility. Strengthening and developing the Bologna process, in particular through the recognition of qualifications, the harmonisation of academic standards and the promotion of mobility are the right way to achieve this objective. Therefore, I am pleased that, in the report adopted today, MEPs have called for more involvement at Union and national level and by all key entities participating in the Bologna process. Subsequent obligations taken on by Member States relating to the Bologna process should be specific and should aim to promote the full realisation of the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea of introducing quotas to prevent an overflow of students from EU Member States was rejected by the Court of Justice of the European Union as being illegal.

It was important to recapitulate the shortcomings and problems arising from the implementation of the Bologna process that slowed it down, so that we can quickly achieve its goal – that the academic qualifications and education of students at any European university are recognised and valid throughout the European Union in order to create a genuine European university citizenship and to strengthen employability.</p>
<p class="contents">Education is a public responsibility of the Member States, EU institutions, and other key players, so it is essential to keep funding and improving education for young people across Europe, including in the context of their mobility. It is also necessary to create some sort of common core curriculum, establish uniform academic titles throughout Europe, and recognise credits obtained by students from their studies with regard to their mobility in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobility should be for everyone and should be the basis for the reform of higher education. In this context, it is also essential to establish the common European Qualifications Framework and, subsequently, to implement it effectively at the national level.

The aim of creating a European Higher Education Area has remained a vision. It is high time that concrete measures are taken concerning the recognition of diplomas and degrees. In order to achieve this, we need to promote freedom of movement within national university systems, because in Austria, for example, students’ qualifications are often recognised in one province and not in another. In addition, the Bologna process cannot be implemented without incurring additional costs, which means providing financial support for the universities. The money should be used to develop national education systems further, so that we can fully exploit the potential of the European Higher Education Area. In addition, we urgently need to reduce the amount of red tape. For example, in order to get a place at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, prospective students first have to overcome the hurdle of access restrictions on medical courses and then demonstrate that they have studied the relevant subjects (physics, biology and maths) in their last two years at school. However, these additional points will only be recognised if the school-leaving certificate confirms that the student has studied these subjects. Other official certificates are not recognised, purely for bureaucratic and discriminatory reasons. As Austrian and French school-leaving certificates do not contain this information, students from these countries are put at a disadvantage and this amounts to discrimination. As the report does not mention this, I have abstained from voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the Schengen Area, the Bologna process is the best showcase of European integration. However, this report correctly identifies areas where there is still much to be done in order for the most important objective of the Bologna process to be achieved. These include the mutual recognition of degrees, the mutual recognition of qualifications and the harmonisation of core curricula. I also welcome the rapporteur’s emphasis on the social dimension of the Bologna process. The Union must accord the utmost importance to fair access and to higher education for all groups within society. Access to education cannot be contingent on the financial, cultural or social capital of young Europeans’ families.

I believe that the Member States should pay particular attention to employment opportunities, and there should therefore be student and lecturer exchanges and an effective dialogue between universities and business representatives. Universities should also form partnerships for the exchange of best practices.

The Bologna process is not only about recognition of diplomas across Europe. It is a very comprehensive tool to tackle such important issues as youth unemployment, which is about 20% nowadays. European youth need the means to become more mobile. 53% of young people in the EU are worried about the absence of jobs in their city or region. 42% refer to the lack of good job opportunities and the same number considers that jobs are poorly paid and that salaries are not adequate for a reasonable standard of living. I urge the Member States and the EU to provide more support for students willing to study abroad. Two major problems have to be tackled: the lack of funds and lack of information on studying and scholarship opportunities. 65% of young people finance their stay abroad with their private funds and savings. Currently, more than 4 in 10 (44%) of young people are not willing, or would not like, to work in another European country. Support for studies will significantly promote European citizenship, cultural diversity and foster intercultural dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In light of the forthcoming Council meeting next month, at which developments will be discussed and new objectives will be set for achieving the objectives set out in the Bologna process, certain general findings need to be formulated. Twelve years after the Bologna Declaration, the climate in the EU is very different. Firstly, the economic crisis affecting numerous Member States, which has resulted in millions of Europeans, trained Europeans, young people with diplomas, being made unemployed requires a very fast policy on recognition of their skills, so as to encourage their mobility, among other things. Secondly, unlike the previous decade, the trend today in numerous Member States is to reduce spending on education by up to 10% compared with 2009. This should not be overlooked. Strong education and strong research in Europe are objectives set in the EU 2020 strategy. This requires robust, not sub-standard education. This reference must not be omitted from the forthcoming Council and it must not be divorced from the objectives of the Bologna process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The importance of the Bologna process and the consolidation of the EHEA in aiding Europe to counter the current period of economic instability must also be highlighted. For this reason, it calls for the need for the Member States and the EU to support this process by increasing public investment in higher education and promoting grants for students.

<p class="contents">Student and teacher mobility in Europe is still in its infancy: fewer than four students out of 100 make use of it at present. Mr Berlinguer’s report, adopted at lunchtime today, comes just at the right time. It points out that there are still too many obstacles when it comes to the recognition of degrees and the ease of studying abroad, and it makes some interesting suggestions. The European Parliament calls on the Member States to redouble their efforts to enhance the consistency of the Bologna process.</p>
<p class="contents">That covers everything from cooperation between universities and the mutual recognition of ECTS credits and university degrees to increased financial support.

The report by Luigi Berlinguer, which I supported, lists the areas of action where we should focus our efforts in order to benefit fully from this initiative’s potential. I welcome, first and foremost, the recognition of the key role played by higher education, reinforced by the Bologna process, in achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of employment and growth. In this regard, all of the actors must be involved: teachers, students and businesses in particular. This is essential to improve what is offered by universities and provide job opportunities for students. I share, in particular, the desire to strengthen the dialogue between businesses and universities in order to provide more opportunities for work experience throughout university courses and thus make it easier for young graduates to enter the job market. Finally, I welcome the desire to increase student mobility within Europe.

<p class="contents">However, there is little point in encouraging young people to study or work abroad if the countries do not recognise the degrees and experience they gained during that period. Therefore, the Bologna process, launched in 1999, was designed to eliminate, by 2010, all of the administrative obstacles to the recognition of degrees and ensure the harmonisation of university standards. Unfortunately, some countries have been slow to act and countless students now find themselves in inextricable situations due to the absence of effective harmonisation. This situation harms not only those involved but also the image of the European institutions, which are accused of being inconsistent.</p>

To this end, the Bologna process was launched in 1999, with the objective of enabling a student matriculated at a European university to have the right to be educated and have their qualifications recognised throughout the EU. The system launched by the Bologna process, which created three stages and the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, has hit a number of obstacles in institutional and applicability terms. There is a need to step up intergovernmental cooperation and increase the involvement of the main players in the process: universities, students and companies. As such, consideration needs to be given to physical, horizontal and vertical mobility; to recognition of qualifications and the framework of formal, non-formal and informal qualifications; to guaranteeing the quality of the institutions; to the inclusiveness and social cohesion of university teaching; to university/business cooperation; and to university involvement in creating innovation.

Nevertheless, the numbers of those who study or teach in another Member State are still very low. Targeted support is needed from the EU institutions to assist Member States and higher education institutions to meet Bologna requirements. Renewed efforts by education institutions and national organisations themselves are also essential in implementing reforms needed to close implementation gaps so that a true European Higher Education Area becomes a reality. Problems with the mutual recognition of academic qualifications, the calculation of ECTS and grades, core curricula, the recognition of Erasmus and practical experience gained abroad continue to act as barriers to students wishing to study in another EU Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully endorse Mr Berlinguer’s report. EU support for the Bologna process will ensure we meet the EU 2020 goals for jobs and growth, as mobility among students will lead to greater labour mobility.

At the interim review stage, and in the midst of the global capitalist crisis, it emphasises ‘mobility’ in order to serve the profitability objectives of capital. ‘Mobility’ needs to be safeguarded as soon as young people become students, so that they learn to roam around acquiring skills that will enable them to move between low-paid jobs with no rights, rather than acquiring scientific knowledge. The capitalocrats want a minimum level of knowledge, so that graduates can then chase after training and certificates. These same people are seeking to consolidate courses so that they can extend class barriers to education. They fund lifelong learning/exploitation programmes and cut spending on social and student care. They insist on equivalence between diplomas and a single qualification certification system, in order to guarantee cheap specialised workers, so as to increase the competitiveness of the alliance of euro-wolves over other imperialist States and unions. The Greek Communist Party has always taken the view that diplomas should be the only precondition in terms of accessing professions because they are based on solid study and on clearly scientific subjects.

I therefore support this report assessing the Bologna process, launched in 1999 with a view to establishing the framework for high-quality higher education in Europe. My hope is that we can achieve a genuine single market for higher education, based on the far-reaching structural reform known as ‘LMD’. However, I regret that there are still obstacles between the university world and the world of employment. Our House is thus sending out a strong message about the need for better integration of higher education and the job market. With the Europe 2020 strategy, Europe aspires to be the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy. That is obviously dependent on high-quality teaching, the recognition of degrees and qualifications, and mobility, not to mention student employability. I therefore support the efforts to encourage the business world to be more open to students, through traineeships and work-linked training. Our growth and our competitiveness depend on the level of education of Europe’s young people and their integration into the workplace.

The paradigm of education as a right that should be guaranteed to all has been inverted, so that there is now a knowledge market and a new business opportunity. The much-trumpeted objective of student mobility has fallen by the wayside, since mobility rates are low, as the report itself acknowledges. It ignores the specific characteristics of each country’s education system in its attempts to harmonise the structure of knowledge and even of content, in a trend towards training for the workplace rather than integrated education. The quality of education is declining, whilst many students are obliged to indebt themselves in order to access a fundamental right.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed, as we argue in our alternative motion for a resolution, is for there to be cooperation between Member States in terms of higher education, but for this to be created whilst guaranteeing the right of all to state-run, free and high-quality higher education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, MEP and former minister for education, Luigi Berlinguer, has done an excellent job and I worked closely with him while preparing an opinion for my political group, the European People’s Party. I therefore also voted in favour of the Berlinguer report. Since the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European Higher Education Area has harmonised considerably. All the associated countries have established three stages of higher education studies. However, at the end of the first decade of reform, many issues still remain unresolved. The three-stage system has caused considerable problems in some countries, since this new concept of university has not yet been fully embraced. Unfortunately, most countries have still not implemented national qualification frameworks linked to the European Qualifications Framework. This greatly inhibits the progress of the Bologna process. The Berlinguer report points out that in its second decade, the main aim of the process remains the mutual recognition of diplomas from any university in the EU in all EU Member States. I hope this report helps to remove remaining obstacles as effectively as possible and that the European Higher Education Area becomes an increasingly effective element of European economic recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first step is to introduce rules of a binding nature regarding the production, and verification of the accuracy, of European statistics. I would like to emphasise that having independent statistical bodies is essential to maintaining the credibility of statistical data. It is a fact that providing accurate statistics can, in many cases, involve collecting and collating data from numerous sources. In this regard, I would therefore like to add that shortening timetables for publication of statistics may, in some cases, reduce the reliability or accuracy of statistics or increase the cost of data collection. In considering best practice in this area, the balance between timeliness, reliability and cost of preparation should be carefully considered. Eurostat should also look at ways to make its publications, particularly those online, more user-friendly to the average citizen and non-professionals, especially with regard to the use of graphs. Eurostat’s website should allow easier access to complete long-term data series and should include intuitive comparative graphs in order to give more added value to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is widely accepted that accurate statistics are crucial to the formulation of appropriate policies, so their impartiality, objectivity and independence should be guaranteed. The report sets out the preconditions for preparing high-quality statistics, and details the failings and shortcomings in both their preparation and their oversight. It highlights the need for statistics to be standardised and to be published at opportune times, as well as the key role of Eurostat in compiling statistics and making them available. It also suggests making it easier and more intuitive for statistics to be made available, so that all members of the public can have simplified access to all data.

I abstained because, although it clearly refers to eliminating political interventions in statistics, the Scicluna report opts for an approach which, at certain points, leaves the door wide open to central political intervention by Eurostat and the Commission. In fact, it adopts a proposal for a systemic approach to the quality of statistics, by which I mean a philosophy of pre-agreed results. The pre-agreed results in today’s EU can very well be translated into austerity policies and drastic cutbacks to labour and social rights. Moreover, the Commission’s reports and the rapporteur are absolutely in line with the agreement on an Enhanced Economic Union that removes the tool of economic and fiscal policy from the Member States. Finally, the report erroneously concludes that the dangers of statistical fraud came to light with the debt crisis, overlooking the fact that, in numerous cases, statistics have long been manipulated and used arbitrarily, for which both the authorities of the Member State and Eurostat, in accepting them, have been to blame. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution includes recommendations on how to guarantee the quality and reliability of data and coordinated activity by the EU’s statistical office and the Member States’ statistical offices, by coordinating many standards and methodologies. I believe that we must reduce to the minimum the possibility of any Member State publishing imprecise or incorrect national statistical data. We are still experiencing the consequences of such action today in the case of Greece. Similarly, we must put an end to the situation where individual indicators, such as growth in GDP, can vary significantly between Member States because of differences in methodology. Data must be comparable and must reflect the corresponding economic situation, so that macro-economic shortcomings may be remedied in good time and so that fiscal policies may be developed in the EU which ensure stability and remove the threat of economic recession. It is in Latvia’s interests to have a stable Europe that can buy our goods, and a responsible policy on the part of other states in formulating budgets will help to ensure this. Prompted by these considerations, I submitted an amendment that was adopted by the European Parliament and included in the final version of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The greatest problem in Lithuania today is the difference between what official statistics say about economic activity and how people perceive their living conditions. Often, this difference stems not from the poor quality of official statistics, but from their inappropriate use. This can lead to biased analysis and inappropriate policy objectives, and may damage both confidence in political action and the functioning of Lithuanian democracy. For example, although the Lithuanian Government and its statistics point to economic recovery and improvement, the reality is rather different. The latest report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has revealed that in recent years, satisfaction with life in Lithuania has fallen by 10%. The report states that young Lithuanians’ confidence in a better future has also fallen by 20%. We must restore confidence and we can only achieve this if political actions – supported by unbiased statistics – have a tangible impact on people’s lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely necessary to enforce a European Statistics Code of Practice in order to have impartial, transparent and objective statistics not only at an EU level, but also at a national level, in cooperation with national bodies. As this report also establishes more user-friendly publications to help citizens understand statistics, I voted in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reliable and accurate statistics are important for policy making, particularly economic and budgetary related. The report highlights the need for impartiality and objectivity in addition to ensuring that statistics are compiled by national agencies separate from political control. We must not let political parties meddle with statistics and skew them to their advantage. I hope that by streamlining the entire production chain, we shall have increasingly accurate facts and figures which have been properly verified and that we can have confidence in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of the prerequisites for the European Union to be able to increase its level of supervision over the budgets of individual Member States. We have had negative experiences with blatant cases of false statistics concerning levels of public debt, as in the case of Greece. Eurostat, which has been in existence since 1953, has therefore rightly gained new powers. These changes should improve the situation in two respects. Firstly, users of statistics will receive more accurate and timely data. Secondly, statistical data will become more readily available to citizens and more easily understood by them. The report therefore deserves our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report also mentions the need to safeguard the independence of statistical services from the threat of potential political interference, at both national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a number of the report’s other premises totally contradict these principles, particularly when it mentions that statistics should produce the data used for monitoring the results of economic governance and the ‘six-pack’, which are nothing more than policies associated with the leaders of the European institutions and the governments that back them.</p>
<p class="contents">We would argue that statistical indicators should be at the service of a full knowledge of social and economic realities and that they should not be selected with a view to pursuing political objectives, particularly when these run completely counter to defending the development of social progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
