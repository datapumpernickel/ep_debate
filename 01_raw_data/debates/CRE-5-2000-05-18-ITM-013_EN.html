<p class="contents">The trafficking in women is having a very great impact, especially in the border countries of the European Union, where mafias are forming which deceive women with promises of employment and a better life, and which lead them eventually into prostitution and, in many cases, into situations which can only be described as slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a phenomenon related to our current society, in which immigration is beginning to cause a serious problem, since we are seeing significant movements of people who are seeking the kind of welfare society which we enjoy in the majority, or practically all, of the European Union countries. This situation requires a series of new measures, most importantly aiding victims and prosecuting the people involved in the trafficking in women and children – since it is not just a problem for women, but children as well – for sexual exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the measures proposed in this report are basically aid to victims and the request that Member States amend their legislation in a way which will allow quicker and more coordinated action amongst the various countries in order to resolve this very serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The victims do not only require material aid, but also legal assistance – because we are generally talking about people with no documentation, with no options and who are living in fear and need help – which, at the same time, protects their identity and guarantees that they will not suffer even worse problems if they return to their countries of origin. The different countries of the European Union must harmonise their legislation in this respect and implement sufficient measures to help these victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The trade in sex is increasing at an alarming rate. Women and children are involved. I believe that the media should also aid this process, because we are seeing more and more adverts in the press – sometimes in the very serious newspapers – behind which lies the trafficking in women and exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only through legal assistance and through protecting the victims that we must address the problem, but also through information campaigns, mainly in the countries of origin, so that these women know what they are really exposing themselves to, since the majority of them are being deceived and do not realise the hell they are about to walk into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This greatly increasing trade is more profitable than drug smuggling and is increasingly being directed by an organised mafia for trafficking in women. Despite this grim reality, the penalty for trafficking in women is exceedingly small compared with that for serious drug smuggling. It amounts to perhaps two years’ imprisonment compared with ten to fifteen years for serious drug-related offences. Few offenders are brought to court, and still fewer prosecuted. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU has so far exemplified the fact that words are not always translated into reality. Despite a number of statements from the EU about the appalling traffic in women, there is still no complete database with information about victims, trade routes, legislation or measures to be taken. </p>
<p class="contents">The European women’s lobby reports that only 0.036 per cent of the EU’s budget for the year 2000 has been set aside for issues of equality and that only a fraction of this fraction goes on measures to combat trafficking in women. A growing number of women are being smuggled in from the candidate States. In spite of this, the EU has not made demands upon these countries to prevent, and to introduce measures against, trafficking in women, similar to the demands that have been made regarding economic and environmental objectives to be attained by the candidate States. By not complying with existing laws and not creating new laws to tackle the mafia concerned, the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing this demand-driven trade to increase. There is a lack of legislation, not only in terms of measures to combat the aforesaid mafia, but also in terms of laws to protect the victims. </p>
<p class="contents">All but two Member States send victims of the trafficking in women back to their countries of origin, in spite of the possibility that their lives may be in danger. We are voting today, or hopefully tomorrow, on an attempt to convert rhetoric and fine words into concrete measures. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is demanding that the Member States provide women who give evidence with protection and refugee status. We demand tough, exemplary penalties for trafficking in women, together with national informants on trafficking in women, able to inform their governments about developments in their own countries, as well as in other countries. We demand measures to combat the increasing use of the Internet for the purpose of trafficking in women, and we demand that national police forces and embassy officials be given appropriate training and that increased resources be made available for the voluntary organisations which provide aid to victims. </p>
<p class="contents">Before the end of this year, the governments of the Member States will presumably have decided upon a new Treaty. We assume that this Treaty will contain a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women, including, of course, trafficking in women, and that we shall be devising a common European policy for combating the trade in human beings. Among the issues which should be covered by this policy is that of immigration and asylum, especially that of the right to asylum on the grounds of sexually motivated oppression and sexually motivated persecution. </p>
<p class="contents">In the United States and Russia, slavery was abolished in the 1860s. It has to be said, however, that the incidence of slavery is increasing, despite the fact that we have now entered the twenty-first century. This new form of slavery mainly affects women and girls but, irrespective of who is being enslaved, the mere presence of slavery is humanity’s best evidence of poverty. </p>
<p class="contents">Many now support the demand to put a stop to the female slave trade, but more is needed in terms of manpower, intervention by governments and concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a serious matter that we should have this type of trade, because it is often not even adult women who are affected but near-children and very, very young people. This trade is very closely linked to drugs and money laundering. Presumably, it is different types of mafia which control it. </p>
<p class="contents">This report is very good. Like the previous speaker, I want to emphasise that we need to see action taken and that police cooperation needs to be developed and more information made available. I am often sceptical about the very large demands, for example with regard to the environment, which are being made of the candidate States. At the same time, I think it would be reasonable to demand that information be provided to the countries’ own citizens, with other information being directed specially at young women. This measure would not, in fact, require large resources, and it is entirely feasible to implement it. I can therefore only appeal to everyone to vote in favour of the report and to go home and work on their own governments, organisations and the media, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This seems to be an impossible task in the case of trafficking in women. Within EU territory and especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, the commercial exploitation of women is flourishing. In the rapporteur’s report, it appears that the measures taken so far have been to little avail. </p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to prevent trafficking in women, we will need to adopt a different approach. We cannot put a stop to this trade by amending immigration and asylum policy and the legalisation of prostitution. And although I am generally in favour of good working conditions, these too cannot halt the trafficking in women. </p>
<p class="contents">After all, as long as the demand for prostitutes is still there, there will always be women who, enticed by better prospects presented to them, will – often unwittingly – make themselves available as merchandise. It is not only heartless criminal organisations, but also rich, and not so rich, customers who help perpetuate the slave labour of these women who have no other prospects. We cannot bridge this chasm between rich and poor with a few initiatives organised at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to a sound and generous development policy in order to improve the living conditions of women in our own countries, it is necessary to question the lack of moral standards within our society. By imposing heavy penalties on criminal organisations which indulge in trafficking in people, we clearly denounce this type of practice. Only in this way can trafficking in women be effectively pushed back. </p>

But I think we need to ask ourselves whether, after four years of work, Europe is sufficiently equipped to be able to fight this trafficking in women effectively. I think I can assume that the Sörensen report makes it abundantly clear that this is not the case. We back Mrs Sörensen’s report 100% and I would like to congratulate her on her sterling work. I would especially like to re-emphasise the fact that the resolutions, which we will be approving tomorrow, fail to display a coherent legal framework for tackling trafficking in women, an issue which, in fact, the Belgian government made a point of hammering home at the time. I think that everyone by now realises that a coherent approach to trafficking in people first and foremost presupposes a clear definition of trafficking in women, which, indeed, is not restricted to forced prostitution, although this is very important, but encompasses all types of trafficking in women and which is linked to deterrent sanctions involving trafficking in people. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is beyond dispute that the national laws and methods for tracing victims and prosecuting offenders within the world of trafficking in women should be harmonised as a matter of urgency and that it is important that police forces work together more effectively. </p>
<p class="contents">A second point which is essential to us in this report – and we have been hammering on about this for a while now – is the fact that we need to continue to be committed to the protection of women who are the victims of such types of trafficking. All too often in many countries, those women are criminalised whereas, in fact, they are the victims. What we are advocating is a legal residence status for those women so that they can be protected. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I think it is clear that without such a legal framework, we will never reach a solution to this problem. In fact, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino at this stage on his intention to present a framework decision to the Council within the course of this year, as a result of which we would then be able to resolve a number of these bottlenecks and issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Patsy Sörensen, our rapporteur, knows the topic of her report like the back of her hand. I would therefore ask the Commissioner, since he is here, when drafting his future policy on trafficking in people, to talk to police forces and the civil service – this goes without saying – but I would very much urge him to make ample time for workers at base and aid workers in the field. After all, it is also their expertise which can ensure that our approach to trafficking in women is coherent and all-encompassing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The body and the human person are not commodities. Even though many women choose to become prostitutes as an easy way of making a living, I would make no distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution: all prostitution is exploitation. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress three points: firstly, trafficking and immigration. A closed border policy prompts immigrants to turn to criminal organisations in order to procure visas or enter the country concerned illegally. The Member States must develop a more united, responsible policy. Thirdly: the victims’ rights. It was proposed that the European Union issue temporary residence permits to victims which would be conditional upon the victims giving evidence against the traffickers, but, as yet, Italy is the only State to issue permits which are not conditional upon the giving of evidence. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by raising the question of clients. Commissioner Vitorino repeatedly stated the need to take into account the demand of this market, that is the clients. But who are the clients? They could be our fathers, our sons or ourselves. It is our duty to do our part to bring about a radical change in the mentality and culture of our society. This means promoting policies which support women.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings supplies various markets: the market in organs for medical transplants, the market in new-born babies for those who do not have any children and the sweatshop market. However, the greatest area of crime involves women, the majority of whom are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The poverty and marginalisation of the women in their countries of origin, the high earnings guaranteed to traffickers and the low risks they incur, and the substantial demand for women for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation are the factors behind the growth of this trade. </p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere European Council recently charged the European Union to fight against illegal immigration and, amongst other things, against those who profit from the trafficking in human beings. Mrs Sörensen’s report goes beyond this perspective and gives absolute priority to the fight against trafficking in human beings. It is estimated that 500 000 women are trafficked every year, the majority of whom then work illegally, but the underground nature of the trade means that the true extent of the problem is unknown. The contribution of non-governmental organisations in revealing the causes, methods and consequences of the trafficking in women for sexual exploitation, and the support they provide for the victims, has brought about greater awareness of these issues. </p>
<p class="contents">The STOP and DAPHNE programmes already represent a major contribution of the European Union, but we must not stop there. Mrs Sörensen’s excellent report stresses the links between the trafficking in human beings and the policy on immigration and asylum, and calls, in the first place, upon the Intergovernmental Conference to bring about integral communitarisation of European policy in this field. As the report requests, it will therefore be necessary to establish a legal framework and effective prevention, protection and victim support measures at European level. On the other hand, the Member States and candidate countries must intervene themselves at legislative, administrative and police levels in order to eliminate this crime and, at the same time, increase international cooperation with Europol and Interpol to fight criminal networks. </p>
<p class="contents">At national level, refugee status must be granted to the victims of trafficking and they must be issued with residence permits. Some countries – Italy and Belgium – assisted by NGOs, have already introduced some early measures. Furthermore, information campaigns must be launched in the victims’ countries of origin and an awareness action pursued in the Member States to raise public awareness, in particular, among the male population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union and the Member States currently have no powers whatsoever to intervene efficiently and break up the gangs operating almost undisturbed in our midst and in our neighbourhoods. The public in Athens was shocked recently at the revelation that an Albanian immigrant, who had declared that he was a doctor, had kept a 13-year-old girl imprisoned in his apartment in a peaceful neighbourhood of Athens for nine months and prostituted her to some 50-60 respectable customers a day.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally advocate therefore that all the strategies used to fight trafficking in and the sexual exploitation of women and children should call for harsh punishment, both for those who profit from the trade in human beings and for those who use the services of prostitutes, as is the case under Swedish and Canadian law. It would appear that the increase in human trafficking has coincided with the recent mass migration of people and the impoverishment of large sections of society.<span class="italic"> Le Monde</span> recently published shocking information on the activities of human traffickers, who are taking advantage of the situation in Kosovo and working with international illegal immigration organisations in order to sexually exploit some 300 000 women in France, Germany and Belgium, women mainly from Kosovo, but also from Moldavia, Romania and Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are being held in concentration camps in conditions of true slavery and are being tortured before being forced into prostitution. What is happening is a disgrace to Europe in the 21st century and betrays a lack of political will and commitment to prioritise this issue. The Commission communication is satisfactory and Mrs Sörensen has presented an excellent report, but good intentions alone will not combat international organised crime. We need initiatives on several fronts: legislative and administrative measures, harmonisation of legislation and prosecution methods, harsh punishment, protection for victims and collaboration between police and judicial authorities. We also need to strengthen Europol with more funds and more staff so that it can start making joint prevention and prosecution plans with all the Member States and, of course, we need to strengthen non-governmental organisations. In other words, we need to implement all the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions immediately. All these are issues, Commissioner, on which we are making no progress whatsoever.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President and honourable Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes the opportunity of participating in this debate on how to develop our common efforts in the fight against trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation following the Commission’s second communication of December 1998. I take the opportunity of paying my respects to my predecessor, Mrs Gradin, who was the author of that communication. May I extend my congratulations to the honourable Member, Mrs Sörensen. Her report is a very valuable contribution towards continuing our work.</p>
<p class="contents">Before going into the more substantial parts of this subject, I would like to state that the Commission remains fully committed to keeping the fight against this degrading form of violation of human rights and human dignity high on the political agenda. We have proved that in the proposals that we put to the European Council of Tampere last October.</p>
<p class="contents">As several Members have already emphasised, preventive and repressive measures, as well as measures to support the victims, together with international cooperation, must be given further encouragement.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted that the resolution that you are going to vote on tomorrow and the report that we are discussing today contain a large number of requests to the Commission. I will therefore try to address a few of these key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish first of all to address the matter of improving existing penal law in the Member States as regards the criminalisation of traffickers of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation. As a starting point in this exercise, we have here the February 1997 instrument, but it has become quite clear that it has its shortcomings. As I understand, during the hearing in August, the Commission will present at the end of this semester a package of proposals on trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and children. We have, in my opinion, a firm basis for this in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Vienna Action Plan of 1998 and the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere. Therefore, we do not need to wait for any change in the Treaties: we have a clear legal basis to address this issue of making trafficking in women a criminal offence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Van Lancker said the proposal is based on a Council framework decision which will look in particular at how to ensure that all Member States have common definitions, common criminal offences and common sanctions. In addition, we need to consider in the drafting exercise horizontal judicial issues such as defining the competent jurisdiction, the rules on extradition and seizure of the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">One important aspect for the future is that when finally adopted, this proposal will form a part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. This means that the candidate countries will have to take it on board in the context of enlargement. Another important element closely related to improving efficiency in the conviction of traffickers is, as I have already mentioned to Parliament, granting temporary residence permits to victims of trafficking who are willing to give evidence. This was one of the Commission’s suggestions in its second communication. The package of proposals that I mentioned before will, therefore, be completed a bit later this year with a proposal for a directive that will cover the issue of temporary residence permits so as to ensure the protection of various victims of trafficking including the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. This element must, however, be seen as a crucial complement to the first set of initiatives. As a matter of fact, there is a real difficulty in convicting those who are responsible for trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the cooperation of the victims, we can never make sure that those who profit from this traffic are brought before a court and are duly convicted. It is extremely important to couple these two kinds of measures: criminalisation of trafficking and, at the same time, having a proactive policy on promoting the cooperation of the victims with the police and with the judiciary in convicting those who are responsible for such degrading activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking about significant developments in the field of trafficking in women at European level, we also need to take a look at the various activities that are, and have been, supported by the STOP programme. Previous and future projects under the STOP programme cover several points that are highlighted in Mrs Sörensen’s report. In particular, I would like to mention two of the priorities set for this year, namely, assistance to victims and prevention. In applying a multidisciplinary approach, this will involve NGOs as well as law enforcement services and I believe that it is necessary to promote closer dialogue between the NGOs that act in this area and the law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As the STOP Programme is now in its last financial year and has made a valuable contribution to the fight against trafficking at European level, the Commission will put forward a proposal for a renewal of the programme for another five-year period starting in 2001. The proposal will, of course, build on experience gained from the first programme. We also intend to offer the possibility of running multiannual projects which will improve the efficiency of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">A word also<span class="italic"> </span>needs to be said about implementation of the new DAPHNE Programme following the DAPHNE initiative adopted in 1997. Its scope, as you know, is to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women and children. This includes trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of women. The programme will allow us, in addition to the STOP programme, to help victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation by providing a financial contribution of EUR 20 million in the period from 2000 to 2003. In addition, more focus has been given and needs to be given to developing our cooperation through specific projects with the candidate countries such as several Members have mentioned of Parliament. We share with these candidate countries a serious common problem, since there is a clear trend involving the Central and Eastern European countries as the most important region of origin of both victims of trafficking and perpetrators. The Commission has, therefore, opened DAPHNE to the candidate countries and will do the same under the STOP Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has also mobilised other sources of financing to promote both support to local NGOs in the candidate countries and prevention campaigns in countries of origin. In the framework of the new Transatlantic Agenda and in cooperation with the government of the United States of America, it has, for instance, carried out various information campaigns in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria, to raise an awareness within the population and the public bodies of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future we are exploring the possibility of new campaigns targeting new areas and new countries. This is an issue that has a relevant role to play in the Stability Pact for the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I wish to clearly underline the importance of the Union being involved in wider forms of international cooperation. The Commission is now actively participating in the work on the draft United Nations protocol on trafficking to supplement the draft convention on trans-national organised crime and I sincerely hope that the members of the United Nations will be able to adopt this new convention in autumn this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to a point that we need to keep in mind when working against trafficking in women at European level. That point is that even though the European Union can, and must, play an active role against trafficking, the Member States have the prime responsibility. This means that we need to be careful when talking about measures such as automatic non-criminalisation of victims of trafficking, possibilities of NGOs bringing court action on behalf of the victims and investigative methods in criminal matters. In other words, we need to be clear about which objectives can be better achieved at European level taking into account the level of cross-border cooperation in place among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members have an opportunity of adapting what I consider a piece of good work that not only confirms a coherent and multidisciplinary European policy on trafficking but also adds new impetus for further actions which are undoubtedly necessary at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for her knowledge, her expertise and her contribution to this common fight.</p>
