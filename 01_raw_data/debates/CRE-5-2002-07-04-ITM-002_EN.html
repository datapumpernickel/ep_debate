<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmid, Herman (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have received another communication from the Commission on developing the local dimension in the European Employment Strategy. I believe this to be extraordinarily important and have tried to develop these approaches in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an unfortunate tradition within employment policy which involves thinking in national terms, i.e. in terms of national labour markets and economies, and viewing the labour market as one single market. However, this ignores the local labour markets, the differences between them and their significance. There is also a tendency for local labour markets to become a kind of leftover concept referring to rural areas or weak sections of the economy and the social economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I use a different definition of local labour markets, i.e. labour markets producing goods and services which are consumed locally. This covers care staff and craftsmen, people who work in transport and technical services, local businessmen, small businesses, local public services, etc., and also includes vital infrastructure in the form of education, etc. These are therefore important elements we are talking about, including in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The area is also interesting due to its having a kind of counter-cyclical economic significance. Local labour markets are affected to a lesser extent by the fluctuating fortunes of the world market. This means that during a period like the present one, with a sluggish world economy, local markets manage best, relatively speaking. If the economy is to bring itself out of the current decline, it is particularly important for local labour markets to be functioning well, as they constitute the bed from which new companies will grow and new activities can be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the importance of these local labour markets. In my report, I point out that they constitute at least 30% of total employment. This proportion may be higher, depending on how one calculates the figure. As such, it is not a question of marginal problems, but of an economically extremely large, significant and important element of the overall employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also stress that these local labour markets are incredibly important for quality of life and social welfare in various ways. These labour markets are dominated by women, which is extremely important in terms of employment: if we are to promote and increase employment, employment of women, in particular, must be improved. Furthermore, these are, more often than not, the labour markets onto which young people first come after finishing their schooling and the labour markets generally most easily accessed by those who are new to the labour market. The local labour market therefore has an important function as a bridge to other parts of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the local labour market is vital to the establishment of major industrial companies, perhaps even multinational companies, in the local social structure, contributing high-quality staff to those companies which need to compete at international level. As you can see, there are many strong social and economic reasons for focusing more on local labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Within EU Member States, there is a great deal of regional and local variation, which suggests that there is much that can be done. I would like to stress that this is as much a question of city and urban areas as of other areas. In the large cities, one can see major local differences between poor immigrant districts and the districts of the rich and between the labour markets linked to these. Many of the social problems which arise are reflected in the employment situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on the three amendments which have been submitted. I have proposed local partnerships which are open to many different types of actor. The proposers of Amendment No 1 wish to remove a number of these actors, which is something I do not understand. Perhaps I will receive an explanation later in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 2, I advocate quantitative guidelines for education policy, about which, not surprisingly, opinion may be divided. I have no objections to Amendment No 3, but am happy to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank the other political groups for their excellent cooperation in the committee with regard to this important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This initiative proposes developing local labour markets in order to achieve high levels of efficiency and quality with regard to job creation and to deal with aspects such as gender equality, the social dimension, economic development, innovation and the information society, as I have stated in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming increasingly necessary to adopt measures that involve incentives and action in the field of economic and social cohesion, paying special attention to the least-developed regions with structural weaknesses and to the most badly-affected groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve these objectives, the proper coordination of National and Local Action Plans is crucial, and these must clearly indicate the role and the level of participation of local authorities, so that the training and the information provided for all actors involved contributes to the improved organisation of the measures to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the Member States must involve local employment agencies in the processes of decentralising the European Employment Strategy, given the physical proximity of these bodies and their better knowledge of the situations of the local labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Women must be both agents and beneficiaries of local employment strategies. Local businesses (as employers) and social partners can and must help to promote career opportunities for women and to reconcile work and family life at company level, for example, through flexible working hours and tax and social security aspects, and the implementation of directives and agreements concluded in this field must, in particular, be speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the objective of equal opportunities within the European Employment Strategy, we must strengthen the financial instruments of Community initiatives, such as EQUAL, the European Social Fund, the ERDF, and in local actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having been the rapporteur on Parliament's guidelines on employment policy in 2000, I take pleasure in referring to what we in the plenary decided almost unanimously at the end of 1999. We decided that "the special role and responsibility of local and regional authorities, other partners at the regional and local levels, as well as the social partners, needs to be more fully recognised and supported. In addition, the role of the Public Employment Services in identifying local employment opportunities and improving the functioning of local labour markets, should be fully exploited."</p>
<p class="contents">The call for Territorial Employment Pacts, sometimes couched in rather nebulous terms in the Commission document, is supplemented in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by the demand for the creation of employment pacts between the social partners in enterprises. I was recently convinced by an example in my constituency of how successfully an attempt of this sort can work. The Bürkert works in Ingelfingen were saved by this. There is a need for a binding guarantee of employment to be agreed in return for workers waiving their rights to certain benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be significantly improved by the incorporation of the local dimension into the European employment strategy. What this is about is European coordination of national employment policies while incorporating also their local counterparts, the objective being a joint strategy to tap society's potential for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. This is about subsidiary solutions that harmonise flexibility and social security. The right formula for the European employment strategy is “think globally, act locally” and it is with that in mind that we want to support Mr Schmid's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission communication, which I consider to be extremely positive, follows the consultation process launched by the Commission in 2000 on “Acting locally for employment”, which involved a large number of actors at European, national and local levels and confirmed the opinion that Parliament had expressed on a number of occasions in the past. It also tallied with the positions of the Commission regarding the necessity and importance of making good use of local actors.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to achieve the goal set by the Heads of State and Government at Lisbon of implementing a European employment strategy which will achieve full, high quality employment while promoting social cohesion by 2010, there is no doubt that we need to give due consideration to, make use of and support the efforts being made by actors at local level, and to tailor our involvement to the sphere in which they are operating. To this end, we need to urge the Member States to follow the recommendations we have consistently provided at European level, namely partnership, support for local employment projects and support for all the actors – whether social bodies or non-governmental or ‘third sector’ organisations – giving primary responsibility to the public institutions. I feel that we really must continue, as we are doing with this communication, to call upon the Member States to ensure through the European employment strategy and the launching of national plans that the local actors are listened to, for it is local officials who have to respond in person to the daily challenges represented by the new demands for job creation and use of mobility instruments and life-long training instruments, which are crucial to the achievement of this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by pointing out that the forum which the Commission has undertaken to organise for next year would appear essential. Secondly, in my own view and in the opinion of the Socialist Group, the amendments tabled are superfluous and run counter to the spirit of unity which characterised the vote on the Communication in committee. We would therefore like the text adopted in committee to remain in its current form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have political disagreements about a lot of things but, when it comes to making the open coordination of employment policy more transparent, we stand shoulder to shoulder, and I would especially thank Mr Schmid for clearly pointing out that the employment strategy must not only be a process driven from the top but also a process developed from below and involving everyone practically engaged on employment policy. We know that it is at local level that large parts of employment policy are implemented. It is here that experience is accumulated and knowledge acquired, and it is here that there is a practical sense of what will be effective in achieving the objective of higher employment. That is why it is crucial to amass local experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to the Commission how pleased I am at the way that local efforts have been incorporated in the context of the Social Fund. The Commission has promised to keep us up to date on the utilisation of the appropriations at local and regional levels in the framework of Article 6 of the European Social Fund, for which EUR 40 million have been set aside for this year and next year. We shall hold the Commission to that promise. It is important for Parliament to monitor developments within this high-priority area. I am also looking forward to a situation in which open coordination involves local and regional levels and in which the new National Action Plans and Joint Employment Report tell us what is happening at those levels. To these issues, I would add that of the Commission’s making more active efforts to obtain information from local and regional authorities. The objective of open coordination is not just that a few experts, officials and high-ranking politicians should meet and confirm each other in the view that we have a good policy. No, the open coordination of employment policy should be aimed at giving elected representatives a better basis for decision-making and voters more knowledge of the options we have in the area of employment policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Greece has over 11% unemployment, the hardest hit being the young, with one in three under the age of 25 unemployed, and there are areas in which there is over 40 or 50% unemployment or under-employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of these proposals is not to combat this tragic phenomenon but to bring employment and social agencies and local authorities within the liberal policy of the European Union. The aim is to turn local authorities into structures which operate according to private-sector economic criteria and help destabilise labour relations, break collective agreements and erode workers' rights. These proposals undermine the labour movement and increase the potential for big business to drive a wedge in, creating artificial divisions and posing false dilemmas. They are an attempt to protect the monopolies' obscene profits from the grass-roots protest and opposition being pumped up by barbaric capitalism and cruel liberal policies. We categorically oppose these policies and are fighting alongside the workers for local authorities and local social agencies for the masses which express the real interests of the people and which the workers can use to weather the neo-liberal storm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The paradigm of economic growth, on the other hand, is an abstraction, with little relevance in practice. Recent developments have shown an increase in unemployment, but the people behind the statistics, losing jobs and income, are being overlooked. The report by Mr Schmid tries to keep sight of the human element behind the abstraction of employment policy. I should like to make two comments on this human measure in the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I set great store by the fact that the resolution stresses the power of local employment plans. In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur points out that the local labour market is stable and less sensitive to the economic cycle. From my own experience as a member of the Capelle-aan-den-Ijssel municipal council, I can report that local employment policy is effective. This does, however, make me wonder about Europe’s role if local employment policy leads to a stable climate. Indeed, in this way, a framework is created at European level for the promotion of employment, far removed from the citizens and their regions, and limiting the scope for developing own initiatives in different areas. </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Europe’s role in the local employment strategy is, in my view, restricted and, at most, a coordinating one. Its role is confined to exchanging experiences with regard to the participation of target groups that are difficult to reach and the role which education has in promoting employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to draw attention to the effects of the formulated policy. The aim of promoting labour participation for women and creating equal opportunities for different groups throws up new dilemmas. Suffice it for me to refer to the impact on families, social contacts, voluntary work and care for others. It is not sufficient to draw attention to the special significance of high-quality childcare. The acquired right of women and men to choose a role in caring for the family and extended family, is a great privilege in our western society. The pressure to take part in the labour process, however, is considerable, and we need to strike a proper balance here. Participation in the labour process need not preclude care, and providing care in families should also be recognised as work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my support for this resolution. European policy on employment should not eclipse local and regional initiatives. However, European policy should support local initiatives to allow citizens to take part in the labour process, so that work and care tasks can be neatly combined. I think this would serve people the most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Incidentally, and everyone is well aware of this, as I take the floor to speak on a subject which I believe to be crucially important, that of employment, I am still a man of the Left and a Socialist in the broadest sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank the European Commission for its communication which, despite not being revolutionary, contains firm proposals, which are capable of moving things forward in the right direction. In an ultra-liberal world, this is a very important sign. I would of course also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Herman Schmid, on the high quality of his work and for the interest and the relevance of many of his proposals to which I subscribe and which have my very strong support. Since this is the case, I would also like to reiterate just as firmly that, in addition to the firm proposals made by the Commission and those by the rapporteur, the important, essential, even vital thing to do is to put employment back at the heart of everything, and at each and every level.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst employment provides all citizens with a purpose, unemployment, on the other hand, can be devastating, isolating and very often destructive. In a world where employment is too often considered to be “an adjustment variable of so-called efficiency and of the very real quest for profit”, it is high time that we re-established our priorities and reaffirmed at all levels that full employment is our number-one goal.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, and because, naturally, there is no miracle cure in the field of employment and since words alone are not enough, we must combine, increase and diversify the initiatives we take at all levels in order to achieve this goal. What we must do, of course, is take initiatives and introduce regulations at world level. At European level, we need to pursue an innovative industrial policy, a research policy and a strong social policy. We must also implement national social policies which put employment above all other considerations. And developments in recent months have meant that many European countries are further away from reaching this goal. We must, at long last, devise local policies that involve businesses, local government, associations, trade unions and citizens. These policies will allow new jobs to be created that are as close to the ground as possible. They will allow jobs to be created for people who are often on the margins of society or in difficulty. They will, lastly, allow us to combine jobs, salaries, services and quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission and the rapporteur are moving forward along this path by making firm proposals. I repeat that I subscribe to them and support them, and that we must implement them swiftly now, whilst resisting the temptation to believe that everything can be resolved at local level. The fight against a rampant form of globalisation, a Europe that is purely liberal and national policies subjected to stock market and finance injunctions affects the success of local employment policies. I am sure that the rapporteur is aware of these issues, but I wanted to use my speaking time this morning to repeat these very clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that all work can be considered local, and although the European Employment Strategy has focused on the efforts made at national and European level, it is increasingly accepted that the objective of full employment cannot be achieved without greater involvement and participation at the levels closest to the job-seeker, in other words, at regional or local level, both from the point of view of the job and from that of the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In considering the labour market as a vertical structure from the European, national, regional and local points of view, nobody doubts the role of the local market – perhaps, quantitatively, one-third of total employment – and this local dimension takes on particular significance in rural and peripheral areas. In this regard, it can and should act as a tool to keep people in certain areas and can play – and I believe it must play – an important role with regard to the most socially vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Many different types of direct local action for employment, with an immediate impact, are also possible, naturally with the support of the European programmes. In any event, municipal or local action can open the doors to work in the fight against gender discrimination, as emphasised by Mrs Bastos, or in the fight against social exclusion. Perhaps all that is needed may be to convince a company – sometimes the largest in a city – that incorporating workers from socially disadvantaged groups into that company is just as important as sponsoring a club – perhaps a football club, since the World Cup has just ended – and also convincing it that this attitude is probably more sensitive and, at least locally, also more profitable, from the point of view of advertising and promotion. Furthermore, where one or a few companies dominate the labour market in a given sector or area, they have the opportunity to diversify and provide greater guarantees for society as a whole. Social agents, who need to be convinced, also have an important role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to end without referring to the importance of the link between local employment initiatives and health and safety at work. Good communication between the local authorities and other authorities can also be a weapon in the battle to lower the accident rate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is the question of equal pay and the other is the question of youth employment. Statistics show that, despite the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation in Europe, nationally and at European level, the gender gap in pay continues to be something like 17% between men and women. In Ireland it is now 20%, having risen from 18% in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still clearly a problem there and if we are serious about addressing a 60% participation of women in the labour market, we have to address the question of equal pay in the review that is being carried out by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that such an approach will encourage voluntary participation by women in the labour market and will hopefully close the gender gap as well.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of youth employment – there are hundred of thousands of young people right across Europe who are excluded from the labour market for all kinds of reasons. If we are serious about breaking the cycle of poverty in Europe, then we have to address this issue. We have to do this through action programmes and targets and in a way which engages with them on a one-to-one basis in a multi-disciplinary way to actually break the cycle of exclusion. Otherwise they will continue to face a lifetime of exclusion and poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were, unfortunately, no additional financial resources; these had to come out of the European Social Fund. Parliament sees local employment markets as having priority. They make substantial contributions to improving the conditions under which people work, to improvements in services, in the social economy, in the third sector, both in centres of population and in regions to which access is difficult. They improve the start-up conditions for new businesses, not only in the regional domestic market, but also at the national and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The under-representation of women, to which Mr De Rossa has referred, means that effective measures need at last to be taken to support them in all positions in businesses. Integration is being promoted. Marginalised groups and the socially disadvantaged such as old people, the unemployed, and people with disabilities, find entry into local labour markets easier. Territorial Employment Pacts, in which towns and local authorities cooperate, are equally noteworthy. Dialogue is taking place between the social partners. What is missing, though, is the purposeful exchange of experiences and best practices across national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make more effective use of the potential of local and regional jobs, we need employment strategies by the social partners in enterprises – of which Mr Menrad gave a very good example – and on the part of the authorities. Aid on the spot can certainly be provided by development agencies, observatories – including via the EU's Socrates and Leonardo programmes – by community initiatives and by the Structural Funds' support of employment services. The concept of lifelong learning will then help with adaptation to technological change and with the acquisition of new knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">I expressly refer to my fellow MEP Mrs Lulling by supporting the demand in Mr Schmid's very fine report for a marked increase in financial resources for education and for its content to be of the best possible quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, the major problem facing the future labour market is that we realise that within quite a short while, we will have a labour shortage across the European Union. This is already the case in certain sectors. At the same time, we in the union have a large number of unemployed people who we are unable to use. This is where the local dimension comes in. We are drawing up strategies centrally which must be implemented locally if we are to be able to match labour market policy with the requirements we see before us on the labour market. We must do this in order for the central objectives to be known locally, but also so that we centrally can be aware of the problems facing those on the local labour markets. I myself come into contact with this. As chair of the EURES Cross-border Partnership for the Öresund region, I can communicate our central objectives for labour market policy, as well as listening to the problems seen in local labour markets in a cross-border region. We must achieve such a balance in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that many actors must be involved at central level, but primarily at local level. Such actors include both sides of industry, NGOs and organisations for disabled people, in order for us to be able to design programmes for vulnerable groups. We should also act via the European Social Fund, for I have seen the Social Fund in many cases playing a major role in the local labour market in terms of providing assistance for the strategies which we draw up at central level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, there is no doubting the importance of local labour markets, resources, institutions and authorities to harmonious and sustainable development. The local level does represent added value, but only if it is allowed to play an effective role in taking decisions that are normally taken at other levels; the local level must not be relegated to being an implementation zone, as unfortunately often happens.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that there is – and has been with every passing year – an increasing panoply of measures and specific projects to boost employment, which means that all policies functioning at local level, all the main players involved and all the local operators must be integrated without further delay. Local authorities, because they are the best placed to do so, can and must work as agents for development to encourage partnerships in the fields of tourism, culture, small-scale industry and the environment, participating in setting up joint companies and micro enterprises, involving young people, women and the unemployed. These are centres of excellence in the field of information, cooperation and training.

<p class="contents">The point of the European Employment Strategy is, of course, to create national action plans on employment and the need for regional and local planning has very quickly become apparent, especially as new conditions on the globalised market and the new definition of isolation – when an area is remote from the centre and when it is not – have changed this dimension with the advent of the information society. And the new way of thinking about production models and employment and in companies has quickly generated a need for local strategic planning and local action plans on employment.</p>

Large conferences were held, one in Strasbourg, attended by delegates from regional authorities, from regional governments throughout Europe, and we have taken account of their views and proposals. We believe that it is very important for local planning to combine local development objectives with the basic strategic approaches to employment, which are basically one and the same: employability, adaptability, entrepreneurship and equal opportunities. This will allow us to create a large number of jobs, different standards of jobs and greater cohesion in local societies.</p>
<p class="contents">So how can the European Union intervene, how can we combine European planning, the European Employment Strategy, national planning, national action plans on employment and local options? The European Commission can, of course, intervene with all due respect for subsidiarity and the division of powers and I think that we have already achieved important results, as we have said. First, through initiatives, be it the Equal initiative, the programmes on exclusion, discrimination and, most importantly, the Social Fund, guidelines have been laid down and we have seen entire local action programmes on employment funded by the Community in several countries. These proposals, also called local initiatives, are the plans we monitor closely, so that we can disseminate knowledge, information and experience. A second factor is the Commission's support for local agencies wishing to take part in these programmes, so that they can access the corresponding funding mechanisms. This happens via very specific information networks and an effort, which I know has not yet brought in results, to cut as much red tape as possible, since this often places an exceptionally heavy burden on local action plans and local agencies. And of course, the Commission is creating new procedural tools to support these local action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the important part which both national and regional parliaments need to play in national and regional action on employment and which they are not yet doing to the extent we should like.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, I would say that we have encountered a serious problem during our evaluation of the implementation of national action plans, as numerous members have said, with cooperation. Cooperation with agencies, initiatives, civil society, the social partners; wherever cooperation is needed, it has not taken the form we would have expected.</p>
<p class="contents">I think you may be interested to know that a pan-European forum on local employment will be held over forthcoming years, under the Greek Presidency, to take stock of progress made with the programmes on local employment currently being implemented in collaboration with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
