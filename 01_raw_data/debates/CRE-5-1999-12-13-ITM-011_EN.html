I have a horrible feeling that the whole ship is sinking. I hope that I am not right, but if we go on like this, perhaps we should join in a chorus of "Nearer my God to Thee", standing in the middle and singing it.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, when the Commission replies, that the Commissioner will be kind enough to reply to the debate in English. It is extremely helpful when he does so, because this is an issue where a number of us have constituents who are very anxious to find out what is going on, and it is extremely helpful if he can reply in English if at all possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a deeply unsatisfactory issue dealt with unsatisfactorily by the Commission. Parliament's Environment Committee has put together a short resolution in order that Members can debate it with the Commission and we can attempt to get some clarification from them. It is unsatisfactory in the approach that the Commission has had to adopt and indeed in the content of the proposal coming before us. What we are doing this evening is commenting on a draft Commission regulation. There is no chance for the European Parliament to propose amendments to it through our normal procedures. We can only object and if we do object, that would hold up agreement. We do not really want to hold up such agreement, so we are taking this opportunity of having this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We underline in the motion before you that we believe that this kind of issue should be dealt with in future through the codecision procedure. In fact, members of the committee find that the whole European Union approach to genetically modified food at the moment is in a rather confused state. Indeed we have a number of Commissioners who seem to be dealing with it, although Mr Liikanen is taking the lead. Legislation has been brought forward piecemeal. We have already had the novel foods regulation, but this is another part of the jigsaw. We feel that consumers may well be very confused about exactly what the European Union is proposing and how it will impact on them and on the food that they eat and the labels that they read. There is still nothing from the European Commission on the labelling of genetically modified material when it is contained in animal feed and we look forward to proposals on that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, the committee received rather conflicting signals about the recommended maximum 1% content level. I really would ask the Commissioner when he replies to the debate to take this opportunity to clarify as publicly as possible why the European Commission has chosen the 1% level.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the Commission was under considerable pressure to go for a much higher level, 5% was the level which some American interests wanted the Commission to go for. On the other hand, there are some members of the committee who argue that a 0.1% level would have been perfectly feasible and pointed out that some supermarket chains around the European Union are insisting on a 0.1% level. I believe that the Commission's answer to this is that the 1% level is the only level at which we can be absolutely sure that the testing methods are available so that they can be firmly based in Community law. If that is the case, then how can supermarkets chains argue to us that a 0.1% level is perfectly feasible? Are the testing methods available, and what about the supermarkets claims?</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was so unhappy about this that it wanted to make absolutely clear to the European Commission that it wants to review of this proposal in short order. I hope that the Commission will comment on the feasibility of this. If the 1% level is found to be perfectly technically feasible, there are many in the Community who want to make sure that it is possible to review that level downwards, and we would like to have the Commission's view on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we turn to the question of enforcement and paragraph 6 of the resolution. Can the Commission state absolutely certainly that it is going to be possible to apply this maximum 1% content level to very small quantities of ingredients? As we read the regulation, it says that the maximum 1% level may apply to ingredients of a product, not necessarily simply to the product as a whole. If that is the case, we are looking at very small quantities indeed, and there are a number of members of the committee who feel that essentially this proposal that we are looking at tonight is unenforceable and represents another occasion where the European Commission has produced something which looks good but which will not actually work out in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The labelling of these foodstuffs is important for two reasons. Firstly, it is not known just how dangerous foodstuffs containing genetically modified organisms or their products are to public health and so it would be well worth monitoring their progress within the market. Secondly, it is important that consumers know exactly what they are buying. Only then can we ensure the smooth operation of the market and win consumer confidence. The Commission has only really dealt with the accidental and, therefore, occasional presence of genetically modified foods and has set an arbitrary 1% tolerance level on just two products, soya and maize.</p>
<p class="contents">Granted this may be at least some progress but the question is this: is it really possible to measure and determine precisely what compound foods such as hamburgers and chocolates, contain and secondly, is it possible to accurately measure below the 1% content level? In my opinion, the Achilles heel of this regulation, which in itself will open the floodgates to corruption, violations and distortions of the law, is that it is impossible to assess exactly what compound foods actually contain and how much is derived from a genetically modified product. We would have to think long and hard before adopting the Commission’s opinion. We expect to hear from you that through the codecision procedure you will review the proposal for a regulation as soon as possible in the light of new scientific and quantitative detection techniques so as to enable us to better address issues such as compound foods containing genetically modified organisms or their products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like your opinion, Commissioner, as to whether you are indeed committed to reviewing this regulation soon, within 12 months, in the light of new data. Only then will the Group of the European People’s Party be able to approve its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may happen long after we have left, but I am sure it will eventually sink into the mire it was built upon. It has already flooded on the ground floor during construction. I expect that will happen again before too long.</p>
<p class="contents">Getting back to the matter at hand, Mrs Jackson has essentially asked all the right questions in the right order. This proposal was supported unanimously in committee because we believe something has to be done, and done quickly, to meet consumer demands for labelling and to meet consumers' justified concerns about knowing what they are eating. The consumer has a right to know. The Commission has made a brave attempt to put something on paper, limited in scope though it is, to help the consumer. I will support that.</p>
<p class="contents">But how practical is it? Is it going to work? The 1% limit on any ingredient – which I and others have been informed is already being exceeded by supermarkets etc. in terms of their requirements for food – is also a limit which I am told can quite easily be met by anyone wishing to avoid having to label foods containing GMs, because of adventitious contamination, whatever that means. It therefore seems to me that an early review is going to be extremely necessary. The net result of this regulation will be, when we bring it in, that the vast majority of food in the supermarket will be exactly as it is now – unlabelled – because the vast majority of food may contain a small amount of GM, below the limit. That will be what happens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making a brave attempt here. The Commission is making a brave attempt here. I would like it to clarify exactly what the scope of its proposal is. I am told that at the moment it only applies to those products derived from soya and maize. I would like the Commission to tell me just how practical it thinks its measures are going to be and how quickly it will be able to change them if they do not work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s regulation is not clear on either front. Firstly, I would like to say that, to my mind, there is an injudicious use of terminology. You are using the word <span class="italic">contamination</span>, whilst, in my opinion, what you mean to say is “presence”. This is why I have submitted an amendment to our text to delete the word <span class="italic">contamination</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is also a lack of clarity, as mentioned by Mrs Jackson and Mr Bowe in this respect. Up to one percent is permitted in unforeseen circumstances, so by accident. I would like to know from you what constitutes these unforeseen circumstances, when it is and is not permitted. How is this evidenced? You also require proof. I am wondering how this is done. Case by case: how should I interpret this? So if, for example, a lorry has loaded 20 tonnes of corn, then 200 kg of this may be genetically modified corn. This is one percent. Or is this not permitted? So if a ship is loaded with 50,000 tonnes of soybean – I hear the largest ships can hold 50,000 tonnes – this may contain 500 tonnes, 500,000 kg of genetically modified soybean. Or have I got this wrong? Do you then say: if there is only 500 tonnes of GM soybean in this ship that this ship is GM-free? I must say, this sounds rather absurd to me. So I would like to find out from you what you mean by one percent in ingredients. Where and when will you check this? </p>
<p class="contents">Under those circumstances, I do wonder if a label makes sense and the situation becomes completely absurd because the literature and circumstances show that a number of varieties can be imported and others cannot. How can you check up on this because it may involve hundreds of tonnes of goods which you are unaware are being imported. The Commission should take measures as a matter of urgency, clarify its proposals and shed more light on the whole matter. If food companies wish to offer commodities to their customers which are GMO-free, they should be able to do this and this is not possible under the current circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We too welcome the fact that there has been some movement at last. But it is regrettable that the Commission has only reacted to pressure – pressure from the Austrian Government – and has been proposing legislation piecemeal for years. Where, for example, is the novel feed regulation? How, Commissioner, can you reconcile this with the new Commission slogan that there should be greater transparency, when for example more than 80% of soya production goes into animal feed?</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked you to tell me this evening whether you are prepared to announce your support for a moratorium until we have a novel feed regulation. Because anything else means misleading packaging with the result that our consumers are secretly sold quasi-genetically manipulated food under false pretences.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to learn from you this evening how long these tactics of submitting to the pressure of the feed industry are going to last, or whether you are finally going to deliver on the promise which Mr Prodi made here of greater transparency for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally – but you know this already – we also think that the 1% is far too high. The level ought to be at least as low as half, as this is possible to analyse. If you are going to assume that there is unintentional contamination then, Mr Liikanen, you will have to explain to me how, in a shipload of soya, 3000 tonnes – that is 1% – becomes unintentionally contaminated! I do not believe that this has anything, anything at all to do with it.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect you to do what you have already said you would do in the committee, which is to endorse Parliament's vote, finally invite everyone to a round table and propose a new threshold as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I expect a clear statement from you this evening on how long the Commission's delaying tactics on the novel feed regulation are going to last, and whether you consider it appropriate, with a view to consumers finally having a clear picture, to support this proposal – part of which was also of course drafted by the Council of Ministers – to declare a moratorium. For I believe that this is the only way to achieve some degree of clarity here.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So why is it 1%? In our opinion, the firms involved in the mass production and use of GMOs are seeking to establish a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> by spreading GMOs across the whole of the food-processing market. They are making it virtually impossible to set up sectors capable of offering consumers GMO-free products.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, it is impossible to guarantee that GMOs will not, in the long term, have any impact on public health and on the environment, especially given that mass production causes them to be dispersed throughout the countryside. The social impact of the widespread distribution of GMOs has been clearly identified: producers and consumers will become ever more dependent on the giants in the food processing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, in order to foil the policy of the <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, the maintenance of complete sectors of production without GMOs must be guaranteed. Both producers and consumers must ultimately be able to identify whether the products they are using contain GMOs or not. Means for control exist. They can be effective if the public authorities have the political will to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, there is no justification today for the existence of a tolerable GMO level within which the risk would be zero or at least acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I also have some criticism: the percentage is not justified because it is apparently a political compromise. A percentage to be selected must be achievable and acceptable. At any rate much below 1, for example under 0.5%. This is why I would ask the Commission to develop procedures to review the percentage in the very short term. We have to prevent this 1% threshold value from becoming a precedent and being applied to the labelling of other products in future. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I find the undemocratic and non-transparent way in which the Commission dictates this standard unacceptable. This is a topic for fundamental discussion which enjoys a wide popular appeal. Furthermore, in this field, the codecision procedure must be applied to the introduction of these measures. Legislation concerning genetically modified products should be transparent, should come about by democratic means and be coherent. I support a democratic and comprehensive policy for genetically modified products. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to labelling, I would like to note that it is time to give serious thought to the symbols used for GMOs. Using minute phrases and words does not offer the consumer sufficient clarity. </p>
<p class="contents">A practical question addressed to Commissioner Liikanen concerns the recommendation of the Scientific Committee to draft a black list. Does the Commissioner share the Committee’s opinion that it is impossible to do this? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out to the Commissioner that standardisation alone does not suffice. The European Commission and national governments should also apply other instruments to maintain the GMO-free chain. I particularly have inspections in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is how we would put it informally. The European food industry is partly to blame for this because they were not prepared to make any concessions in the past. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the argument which has led the Commission today to include the 1% level here in this implementation was the fact that that which was held impossible in the past, namely identification and detection under the one percent threshold as well, is now possible. Mr President, because measuring methods are available. This means that in fact, anything can be detected at present. </p>
<p class="contents">However, the regulation which is now in place means that we will soon have four types of food. Firstly, GMO-labelled food; secondly, food which is not supposed to contain any GMOs; thirdly, the category with the maximum 1% tolerance level and fourthly, all the supermarket chains which say that they can guarantee 0.1% although with the best will in the world they could not even guarantee this 0.1% because even in the identity preserved-chain foods will always contain more than 0.1% of GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this legislation shows up two deficiencies. Firstly, regulations are not just in place for maize and soya. I wonder when the rest will surface. Secondly, as Mr Sterckx has already mentioned, the term ‘contamination’ will need to be replaced by ‘presence’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to mention another issue. Whatever will we be faced with next? At present, we are only dealing with food available to the consumer. But if, for example, I consider the foodstuffs or the food for our livestock, then we would need to refer to this novel feed<span class="italic"> </span>directive and I would also mention the comments made by Mrs Breyer. Mr President, it would thus mean that if you know that all the proteins originate from abroad, say from South America, that you will soon also need to label absolutely everything with GMO identification within the framework of this novel food directive.</p>

It is in fact a very striking result of the fact that, for years, we have seen a lack of overview and cohesion in GMO legislation. We have not made the necessary demands when it comes to distinguishing between GM material and non-GM material. We are therefore now forced to accept a certain quantity of GM materials in all produce, without our being informed as consumers about these. For the citizens of Europe, this really is quite a depressing development in terms of consumer policy. </p>
<p class="contents">I can support the present motion for a resolution, but I also think it is worth emphasising that the 1% limit set by the Commission is definitely too high. It opens the way to carelessness and indifference on the part of suppliers and producers. There is every reason for thinking that the limit will be eroded in future. I should therefore like to request four things of the Commission. Firstly, that a lower triviality limit than 1% be set. If this is not desired, then a one-year review clause, as proposed here by Parliament, might at any rate be agreed to, in anticipation of reducing the triviality limit. Thirdly, the claim of adventitious contamination due to GM materials must be carefully defined. This is a very elastic concept that has been built into the proposal here, and I believe it needs to be defined very clearly. Fourthly, and finally, I would ask that a very efficient supervisory system be established so that we might counter the worst examples of carelessness in this sphere. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Commissioner Liikanen will be able to respond positively to these four questions and requests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There must be clear advantages for consumers, and there must not be any danger to the environment or to animals’ welfare. It is, and remains, the legislators’ task to establish rules and guidelines to ensure that the market develops in such a way that the concerns and requirements of consumers too are taken seriously, and that is not the case with the EU’s labelling requirement. It has already been said many times now that a figure of 1%, set as the threshold value for the adventitious presence of GM materials in food, is way beyond what can and should be accepted as the triviality limit. It is possible to separate GM crops both in the fields at harvest time, in the course of transportation and during processing. This requires a good system of consultation from field to table and, therefore, higher costs too, but it can in fact be done. If, against all expectations, this is not the case, then this is merely another argument for prohibiting the cultivation of GM crops. The next best solution, involving GMO-free labelling, I regard as defeatist, except as a supplementary, voluntary option. </p>
<p class="contents">Until now, GM foodstuffs have only had advantages for producers. The costs of labelling and supervision should therefore be borne by the producers of GM foods. The risk in eating the products and the long-term consequences for environmental and biological diversity ought to go on being investigated. A direct result of this is the de facto moratorium which five countries have introduced into the EU’s procedure for approving new licences to release genetically modified organisms to the environment and which is to remain in force while the relevant directive is being revised. I am therefore surprised at the reports that Commissioner Wallström does not want to wait for the final revision but has instead backed industry’s offer to comply with the revised GMO Directive even before it is adopted. This is a treacherous attack on the Member States’ moratorium. Moreover, the Council of Ministers’ common position does not go far enough. All I can do, therefore, is call upon the Member States to stick to the moratorium. It is imperative that the GMO legislation should be revised and tightened up – and preferably now rather than in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only do consumers need to be reassured, but the industry also needs a climate of certainty within which to operate. May I say that I speak with a background in the industry, though since joining this House I have of course severed all ties with it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my previous life I was managing director of a snack food company that made tortilla chips. It also made an excellent British delicacy called pork scratchings – which I just toss in so as to keep the interpreters on their toes. Tortilla chips are made of 100% American maize; and certainly when our customers asked for guaranteed GM-free identity-preserved maize, we had very great difficulty in securing that. All the tests we did, in testing that was widely and commercially available, showed even such maize occasionally contained between 1 and 2% adventitious GM material.</p>
<p class="contents">So to those such as Mr Bowe who say 1% is a target that can easily be met, I say from experience that it cannot easily be met. It is a very challenging target. I believe that the industry has accepted that target, but with some trepidation. If that target is reduced, what is quite likely to happen – because industry will not meet it – is that increasingly it will just label everything 'May contain GM material' – which completely undermines the purpose of this labelling. That is the first point I would make: the target is already tough.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point regarding a review is that the industry needs certainty: so constant changes every 12 months are no good for the industry, and indeed confusing for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point, going back to a point that Mrs Jackson made to begin with, is that we must ensure, when labelling comes in, that equal rules are applied with certainty across the EU. As we approach a new millennium, maybe we can start a new trend towards ensuring that such laws will be universally enforced and applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This subject has already been discussed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on 15 November. I stated then that it is not only an issue of whether we like or authorise GMOs or not or whether we label them or not. We are simply trying to implement the existing legislation and make it operational.</p>
<p class="contents">With the proposal amending Regulation No 1139/98, laying down <span class="italic">a de minimis</span> threshold for the adventitious presence of authorised GM material, we are responding to the Council's mandate on labelling of GM foodstuffs. The Commission was obliged to do so at the time of adopting the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft aims to solve the problem of labelling foods when operators have tried to avoid using GM material and can prove this but nevertheless small amounts of GM material are found in them. This adventitious contamination can occur during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage and processing. After our consultations with the Joint Research Centre and Member States in particular we concluded that a value of 1% is a compromise that best serves two things: firstly, the purpose of establishing a very low tolerance level which implies an effort for operators; secondly, that it takes into account the necessary feasibility along the production chain.</p>
<p class="contents">We will shortly have methods that do not pose competent authorities unjustified problems for implementation. I would also like to mention that this value is stricter than thresholds applied by other countries like Switzerland, Norway and Japan. As you know, unlike the EU, the United States of America and Canada have no compulsory labelling of GM foods.</p>
<p class="contents">The wish of the committee is that we should reassess this issue. I am ready, on behalf of the Commission, to make a commitment: "The Commission will review the draft regulation amending Regulation 1139/98 within one year of its entry into force. The Commission will propose any necessary amendments in the light of improvements in quantitative detection techniques and practical experience gained with implementation of the proposed 1% value. Moreover, the White Paper on food safety will also allow the opportunity of a wide debate on labelling if it is wished by the European Parliament."</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not exceeded its executive powers by proposing these regulations. The two draft measures are consistent with current legislation. We will use the codecision procedure when the European Parliament calls for the GMO-free scheme. So far as the novel food regulation is concerned, Mr Byrne's department is preparing a proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
