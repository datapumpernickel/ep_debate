<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villy Søvndal, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, thank you again for giving me the opportunity to speak on Nigeria on behalf of the High Representative. It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Nigeria is at a crucial juncture. President Jonathan’s reform policy can shape Nigeria’s future. Its democracy is consolidating and its economy is growing rapidly. Nigeria has the potential to become the biggest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa within a few years. It plays a major role on the African continent, it was a member of the Security Council last year and is a member of the Human Rights Commission this year. Former President Obasanjo recently led the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) – African Union mission in Dakar to monitor the elections and this sent a strong message in support of democracy and people’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the honourable Members for their interest in Nigeria for recent months. I say this with particular conviction because I had the pleasure of representing High Representative/Vice-President Ashton at the recent Ministerial meeting with Nigeria in Abuja on 8 February. It was a remarkable occasion and a very positive one.</p>
<p class="contents">Nigeria still faces crucial challenges: The European Union strongly condemns the recent attacks carried out by Boko Haram, with appalling loss of human lives. The Christmas bombings of churches and the recent suicide attack on a church in Jos on 26 February and again on 11 March are deeply shocking. So are all of the other attacks, including that in Kano some weeks ago. They should all be condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the number of attacks and human losses are increasing every day in an unacceptable spiral of violence. High Representative Ashton has repeatedly expressed her solidarity and sympathy with the victims, the injured and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make use of this opportunity to express our profound sadness at the loss of life of two European hostages in Nigeria on 8 March. We condemn in the strongest possible terms criminal actions such as the taking of hostages. Our heartfelt condolences go to their families for the irreplaceable loss they have faced. May they find strength in this difficult time.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU stands alongside the Nigerian authorities in their fight against terrorism, to protect all citizens, in particular, the most vulnerable, and to preserve the right to life and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The root causes of Boko Haram are many, but it is no coincidence that it is strongest in the north of the country, which has some of the worst socio-economic indicators in Africa. Nigeria’s North-East Region is one of the world’s forgotten emergencies: the grievances there need to be addressed urgently, and we as partners and friends have promised the government to help them do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Boko Haram is targeting the secular democratic state, and Muslims and Christians. Nigeria remains a secular state with religious freedom firmly enshrined in its constitution. However, Boko Haram is trying to exploit the ethno-religious differences, which will always exist in a country as big and diverse as Nigeria. Nigeria’s complex problems certainly have religious dimensions, but they cannot simply be blamed on religion. We have a well-established regular local human rights dialogue with Nigeria, during which all important issues, including freedom of religion or belief, are raised. The most recent such dialogue meeting took place in February this year. The EU is committed to supporting the government and people of Nigeria in ensuring religion is not misused to legitimise politically or criminally motivated violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that the EU has been very active on the issue of freedom of religion or belief, especially during the last two years, as many countries – not only Nigeria – have experienced a surge of acts of religious hatred and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We have used our full range of instruments, either bilaterally or in multilateral fora, in New York and Geneva, to be at the forefront of the fight against religious intolerance. We will continue to do so. EU delegations have been requested to follow closely the situation of their host countries and report on issues and actions taken. As required by the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in February 2011, the overall action of the EU in this respect should be reviewed by the Foreign Affairs Council in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, fortunately, some positive signs of Nigerians taking initiatives to ease the situation, such as the Association of Muslim Students, who exposed on Facebook the fallacies of Boko Haram. Important leaders of Islam in Nigeria have rejected Boko Haram as misguided and murderous fanatics. Nigeria’s Catholic bishops have highlighted that the Boko Haram crisis has also brought the best out of many Nigerians such as Muslims and Christians protecting each other. The government is also making progress in developing and implementing a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, and several prominent Boko Haram members have been arrested. During my meetings with the Nigerian Government in February, I encouraged them to explore this counter-terrorism strategy further.</p>
<p class="contents">Nigeria matters to the wider world. It plays a big stabilising role in the region. It is the fourth largest oil exporter in the world and the second most important exporter of natural gas to the EU. Nigeria is firmly committed to the UN, is a major provider of UN peacekeepers and is vocal and robust in its support for democracies and freedom. Nigeria’s positions in the recent Ivorian and Libyan crises speak for themselves. In short, I found a strong and open African partner, which, in many ways, shares our views and our values.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministerial meeting resulted in several openings, which we should now explore further. One is the agreement on establishing a local dialogue on peace, security and stability, and other openings are Nigeria’s interest in climate change and Rio+20.</p>
<p class="contents">It was interesting to hear from Nigeria’s leaders how they see their economic development. They are diversifying to reduce their dependence on oil and gas, investing in infrastructure and agriculture, and focusing on job creation for their young and growing population of 160 million people. I heard many times that Nigeria strongly encourages European investment and participation in its strong growth.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Nigeria faces serious challenges, not least widespread poverty. Better governance, maintaining ethnic harmony and fighting corruption and crime are some of the big tasks it faces. Although Nigeria’s human rights record has improved steadily in recent years, there are still areas where further improvement could be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The security situation in the Niger Delta, although improving, remains fragile. The region is vital for the national economy because of its oil production, so ensuring its peaceful development is essential. The EU is currently implementing a EUR 200 million programme to assist the development of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Bricks, stones and words can be used to separate people, but they can also build bridges. Therefore, honourable Members, I call upon you to use your contacts with Nigerians to support and facilitate this absolutely essential bridge-building with Nigeria and I look forward to the resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to publicly remind the Chamber about Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, who are not just two European citizens; they are two men, two people who loved that country very much and sacrificed their lives there. They should be considered on a par with all the Nigerian citizens who have lost their lives in recent months, the victims of a particularly fierce strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy is using God’s name to implement its plans to achieve power, crippling the efforts of the government, the people, the institutions and the civil society of Nigeria to make this country a leader within the African continent. Therefore, Mr Søvndal, I say that the real problem of Nigeria is not ethnic or religious tension, but the fact that behind the ethnic and religious tension, there are interests and power strategies to achieve these interests, which have had such a negative impact in the last few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, we must be concerned, because having a clear view does not mean that we are in a position to avoid the risk of a civil war. This strategy is gaining the upper hand in many areas of the country: the strategy of the fundamentalist groups. While it is true that they are using religion in a distorted manner in order to achieve energy resource control, for example, at the same time, they are encountering a very weak response from the government which is coming across as particularly indecisive.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I ask you to be particularly concerned with implementing the actions you have proposed, in which you will have the support of the whole Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the one hand, the population is living in poverty –which is still extreme – particularly in the north, while, on the other hand, there is an immense wealth of oil resources being exploited by companies that are polluting Nigerian waters without hesitation. There are also religious conflicts between the Islamic North and the Christian South, the presence of Boko Haram and therefore hard-line terrorism, which has led to the tragic deaths of two hostages. There is still political corruption. There are social troubles against the backdrop of poverty, but you have spoken, it is true, of the democracy that is beginning to emerge, of Nigerians taking charge of their own destiny.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of everything, violence is still part of their daily lives. The paradox of all this is that we can clearly see the role that Nigeria plays – and you have described it well – at international level and at African level, particularly in Western Africa. It contributes, as you said, to promoting the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), whose headquarters are in Abuja. It has increased conflict resolution initiatives. In recent years, it has led mediation meetings in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. It is involved in many UN peacekeeping operations in Africa. It has even recently deployed an entirely female police force in Liberia.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of this Nigeria that we are talking about today in the resolution, with its clear and sombre face, we wanted nonetheless to condense the very specific requests that you have asked us to relay. We are asking them to demand that oil companies operate with transparency and respect for the environment and that they clean up the damage caused to the environment. Amnesty International has written entire reports on this issue. We have called for a law criminalising homosexuality to be abolished, then, and I say this with force – it is one of my group’s priorities – for the imprisoned trade unionists to be released, and finally, for both a fairer distribution of wealth and religious tolerance to be guaranteed, since intolerance is still a breeding ground for terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hope and anticipation among Nigerians was remarkable. They welcomed observers; anything that could ensure their vote would count and be counted transparently.</p>
<p class="contents">On the night before the first round, an explosion close to Abuja killed 25 people preparing for the elections – most of them youngsters, serving their year in the National Youth Service Corps, sons and daughters of Nigeria. Violent extremism kills indiscriminately and, combined with poverty, corruption and related problems, it does not take much imagination to picture how the extremists would achieve their goal to destabilise the country, to pit people of different religions against each other, and to recruit those without perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Nigeria is home to one fifth of Africans. It is a leading nation in West Africa, for better or worse. Half of the population – 75 million people – are under 18 years of age. They will demand the opportunities they deserve. Many of the youngsters know more about the world than their parents did, through media and new media, including the fact that not everyone is poor and that it is not necessary to be poor in such a rich country. The young generation filmed the vote count of the elections on their cell phones and they will hold the authorities accountable. I would not be surprised at a Nigerian Spring one day.</p>
<p class="contents">We must invest in this young generation and do what we can to give them education and opportunities. An important prevention for being recruited by extremist networks is such independence economically. Nigeria is rich – I emphasise it again – in resources and in human capital. The EU stands ready to help to ensure more equal benefit from wealth and more equal distribution and good governance and to prevent and end the terrorism in a sustainable way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When things do not go well for Nigeria, then the whole region becomes unstable.</p>
<p class="contents">And things are not going that well for Nigeria at the moment. Although the country could be earning good money from its oil, more than half the population is living in poverty. What lies at the root of this is large-scale corruption. The oil dollars are disappearing into the pockets of a lucky few. The gap between rich and poor is increasing, and Nigeria is just one example of the many countries in Africa whose wealth of raw materials ought to be a blessing and, yet, it has become a curse.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty makes people vulnerable to extremist ideas. Religious groups step into the gap left by the government. You can blame your poverty on someone else, someone adhering to the wrong faith. Another variation of that is blaming your poverty on the fact that you are not following the doctrine of your religion strictly enough. ‘Join us in strictly adhering to doctrine’.</p>
<p class="contents">Communities in Nigeria are going after each other’s blood in the name of their God. We might as well call this by its proper name. It is therefore best that we look for the real causes of poverty and see whether anything can be done about them. One of its causes is corruption. In any case, in the short term, the EU can do something to combat the corruption there by applying its Transparency Directive to oil and to mining, because if we publicly declare how much European companies are paying the Nigerian Government, then the Nigerians will also be made aware of that and then the money will not be disappearing into really deep, dark pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore disappointed to see that Shell, the Netherlands’ largest oil company and a major player in the Niger Delta, is putting pressure on the Dutch Government to try to kill off the Transparency Directive.</p>

Recent events, following repeated atrocities and kidnappings by the jihadi group Boko Haram, remind us that Nigeria sadly is a chronically unstable country.</p>
<p class="contents">By rights, Nigeria, as the most populated and oil-rich country in Sub-Saharan Africa, should be vying for a permanent seat with South Africa on the UN Security Council, but instead there are now concerns about a civil war between the Muslim-majority north and Christian-majority south, to which are added ethnic, cultural and economic tensions in Nigeria. The central government struggles against these factors and in fighting the still very widespread corruption in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">The added element of a secessionist insurgency from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta makes the security situation particularly precarious in this country. The introduction of Sharia law in 12 states, in contradiction of the secular, federal constitution, also causes widespread fear amongst Christians in the north and there are increasing concerns about the long-term sustainability of Nigeria as a unitary state.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent brave attempts on 8 March by the British Special Boat Service to free the kidnapped Italian engineer, Franco Lamolinara, and British national, Christopher McManus, ended in the tragic death of both individuals and I extend on behalf of my group my deepest sympathies to the families of the deceased. Boko Haram and all those responsible should be held accountable for the murder of these two EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">President Goodluck Jonathan struggles to bring order and security to his country and is committed to fighting corruption and ending massive economic subsidies, such as to fuel, in order to restore free market economics to Nigeria’s large economy.</p>

The latest official data says that the Boko Haram armed group, which wants to convert the country to Islam, has killed 1 200 Christians in the last two years and forced 35 000 Christians to flee the country. However, in some Arab countries, too, like Egypt and Iraq, millions of Christians are discriminated against, even killed or forced into exile.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a sort of growing religious racism against Christians that is being accepted almost with resignation or fatalism. In this situation, the international institutions, including Europe, and important political and religious figures must make their voices heard loud and strong and call upon governments to face their responsibilities. I should add that I would also like to see the so-called moderate Islamic citizens, who quite rightly reject extremism, join us in defending the rights of their Christian fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to Nigeria, we have mentioned the widespread poverty, the high levels of poverty of so many millions of people in this extraordinarily rich country that could so easily provide amply for all its citizens. As Ms Sargentini says, there is a problem and that is corruption, which is so widespread and pervasive that it has altered the social structures of the country. With corruption, there is no respect for the environment, no free market, no opportunities for trade or young people, and therefore, ultimately, there is no democracy either.</p>

It has also long been known that Sharia is present in 12 states. For years, thousands of people have been dying in Nigeria. We are all aware of that, and for years nothing has been done about it. Overall, however, it is clear – and in this regard I would like to follow on from what Mr Provera was saying – that in many Muslim countries, which are allegedly experiencing a new Spring, there is substantial persecution of Christians. Whether it is in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria or Sudan, it is striking that more and more Christians are coming under pressure there, and we have no answer to this. Therefore, the European Union must have the courage to attempt to develop and justify a new offensive and defensive strategy and to allow this to influence policy. It is not enough simply to adopt this statement tomorrow. It may well be right – it is not wrong, and therefore I can support it – but it is not enough. Anything can be written on paper. The situation of the Christians in the countries listed is, unfortunately, not so easily dealt with, and the people there urgently need our help. Therefore – and this has nothing to do with religious conflicts – Europe must support these Christians, also in respect of the freedom of conscience and belief, and consider new strategies and new developments for ways in which it can better help these people and exert more pressure on the governments to actually assist these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it has been a very interesting one. As I said, I have formed new impressions as a result of my visit to Nigeria, and I would like to communicate these further in relation to some of the things that have been said. After that, I will hand over the floor to the Commissioner, who will take over from there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by saying that there are some who have an interest in turning this into a religious conflict – a dramatic religious clash. That is what Boko Haram wants – namely, for this to become a huge religious conflict. I believe that we need to be very careful not to fall into its trap in a country where members of different religions sit together in the same government, a country where people marry people of different religions, where people of different religions live side by side, and a country that, of all places, is capable of avoiding a major religious clash. I believe that we should be very careful about playing the religious game. Having said that, this is actually a fight for the right of all religions to be practised, protected and taken care of. I believe that, in this debate, we must remember that the first to be killed if Boko Haram gets a hold will be the Muslim groups who are carrying out attacks up in the northern part of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who deeply regretted the attacks by the same organisation on 8 March. We expressed our sincere condolences to the families of the victims. We condemn these acts as exactly what they are: criminal acts. It is a criminal act to kill other people, irrespective of what argument you use to justify it. I believe it is important to repeat that there is no argument on earth that gives people the right to take the lives of other people for the sake of a political issue. Therefore, those who do this must be brought to justice. They must be sentenced and put in prison. They must not be elevated to the status of martyrs for what they have done. Killing other people is purely and simply a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that some of you will have the chance to visit Nigeria’s political leaders, both its President and a number of its ministers. I also hope that you will return with the same impression that I had, namely, that it is very rare to see an African country that has political leaders of such high moral strength and great competence. That is also what we need, because they are facing huge challenges in relation to the fact that this is a country with a very young population and a high level of illiteracy, a country that is, to a large degree, bound to oil as its only source of income, a country that has problems with terrorism up in the north and one that also has the prospect of doubling its population over the next 40 years. That is rather a tall order for a government if it also has the task of governing a poor country. That is precisely why it is so good that it has a government with such high moral standards as it has right now.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that even in this situation, with these odds, Nigeria is able to play its part as a stabilising factor in relation to the areas of West Africa, which, incidentally, have experienced very high economic growth in recent years. I also agree with all those who said that it is crucial for a country like Nigeria, which is not a poor country, to ensure a better distribution of wealth in order to benefit the many and to combat corruption. That is what they are trying to do, but the people leading the fight against corruption do not stay very long in the job – as it is a relatively dangerous job! With these comments, I wish you well for the continuation of the debate. We need the European Parliament to keep an eye on what is happening in this country, which may perhaps end up being the world’s third largest country in terms of population size over the course of the next 40 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hundreds of people have been killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Boko Haram is using religion to destabilise Nigeria. The socio-economic inequality there, the poverty, the high levels of unemployment, the corruption and the lack of prospects, especially for young people, are providing fertile ground for extremism. I believe – as other members have already said – that we, as the European Union, should not only strongly condemn the violence, but also do everything in our power to support Nigeria. The most important thing in this regard is that we, as the international community, also find out the underlying causes as to why people in Nigeria, a country so rich in resources, are not actually able to become rich themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that we also have to do everything to encourage cooperation in the region. We, as the EU, should contribute to that process.

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the one that has the best prospects for economic growth and for attracting foreign investment. Its position as an oil-exporting nation allows it to acquire substantial resources, which should be used in the vital task of fighting the poverty and inequality that blight the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as we in the Committee on Development have maintained on many occasions, human rights, democracy and development have a synergistic relationship of mutual reinforcement. At the root of the conflict in which Nigeria is embroiled lies the absolute poverty in which a large proportion of the population lives. The nation’s wealth is not being redistributed amongst the lowest levels of the population, and this is making millions of Nigerians vulnerable, with no access to the most basic services.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, by way of its cooperation and development policies, can make a real difference in this country. We must focus our common strategy on the fight against poverty through the provision of basic services, such as health and education, for the most vulnerable. The value added by the European Union in this country should, without doubt, be to achieve a reduction in inequality and to turn the growth that the country is experiencing into increasingly fewer people living in extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be wary, however, because we now know better than ever before that our cooperation policy will not be enough. We have to strive for consistency in the European Union’s other policies vis-à-vis Nigeria. I also want to stress the importance of transparency and responsibility amongst European companies operating in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Commissioner, by mentioning a very serious risk that threatens Nigeria and the whole region of West Africa and the Sahel. The very prolonged drought, poor harvests, lack of livestock, and the rise, once again, in the price of food are now hinting that a famine in the region is imminent. United Nations agencies and civil society organisations are already declaring famine. We must react in time and deal with this famine before it claims more victims in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nigeria is still incapable of fulfilling its sovereign functions, including, in particular, the protection of its citizens. Its authority is regularly undermined by factions acting either in the name of Islamic fundamentalism or violence against religious and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also remember that Nigeria is not a state that is lacking in resources. These resources, particularly in terms of oil, do little, if anything, to alleviate the needs of the population. The measures approved by the Commission to remedy the instability in the Niger Delta, to work towards improving governance, to provide support for anti-corruption measures and so on, are, of course, relevant and useful, but responsibility lies, first and foremost, with the Nigerian authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a major country, as we have heard, which is extremely important in the region and potentially internationally. I very much regret that the only way we seem to be able to discuss events in Nigeria is via yet another resolution which has taken religion as its focus.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to respond to some of what has been said today. Let us be clear here that, while Boko Haram is the major force behind the violence, they are not killing only Christians. Muslims have died too. They have also assassinated Muslims who do not agree with them. However, there have also been Muslim deaths where Christians – or so-called Christians – have retaliated. We have also seen these events being condemned by political and faith leaders from a variety of different perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to remember what has been said about what links this country, and not just what divides it. Yes, corruption is an issue. There is more that we could be doing. I, for one, very much welcome the recent trial in British courts of Ibori, a former governor of Delta State, which put him in jail. There is more that our own countries can do to deal with corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Nigeria want a government that is fit for purpose. That is why, as we have heard, they were willing to stand for hours in the sun waiting to vote. However, I believe that the European Union, too, needs to change its relationship with Nigeria and that this Parliament should be strengthening its relationships with the Nigerian Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a depressing situation, one in which Christians would rather take their own steps to protect their churches and religious communities than rely on the police or the army. This is what I heard from a local observer this very morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The unbridled violence of Boko Haram and its Islamist followers is causing a huge amount of tension within the large Christian minority in Northern Nigeria. For Biblical reasons, the older generation wants to restrain young people from taking reprisals against their fellow Muslim citizens, many of whom have also become victims of Boko Haram, and, more than anything else, wants to exercise conciliationism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a powerful spiritual struggle which deserves impartial government support. That brings me to the core problem which has been mentioned in the resolution, too. To what extent has Boko Haram infiltrated the Nigerian state apparatus?</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions on this that I would like to put to the High Representative or her substitute. I will give them to the Commissioner now and I hope I will be able to put them to Baroness Ashton next week when she visits the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. What views does Baroness Ashton or the Council have on this? To what extent has high-level infiltration taken place in Nigeria?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question, which is based on reports, is: to what extent is Boko Haram operating closer to Europe: for example, in large Nigerian communities in the United Kingdom? The answers to these questions could be extremely important for many things, including deciding what position Europe should take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The broad Christian population of Nigeria is living in fear. Suicide bombers have targeted places of worship. In late February, in the city of Jos, three people died as a bomb was driven into a church in but one of the latest attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorists gave this chilling warning: we attacked simply because it is a church, and we can decide to attack any church. We have just started. It seems that the militant Islamists of Boko Haram desire to rid Nigeria of its Christian population. Of course, I accept the point made by others in this House that others apart from Christians have suffered and died, and I want to make it clear that I condemn all these attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Losing your life because of your religion is not acceptable. We in this House should call it for what it is. It is not simply all about poverty or corruption, but it is about attacking a particular section of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, unfortunately, we have to say that the situation in Nigeria has deteriorated. While it is true that freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Nigerian constitution, the authorities in Nigeria are too weak to fight organised crime, which does not accept the idea of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The organisation Boko Haram, which is terrorising the Christian community and is fighting for the introduction of Sharia law in all of Nigeria’s states, is resorting to bombings, in which over 1 000 people have now died. A week ago, two hostages died at the hands of the same group: a British and an Italian citizen, who had been held captive for 10 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, the European Parliament was in doubt as to whether the main motivation for the outrages in Nigeria was religion. The experts were of the opinion that the roots of the violence in Nigeria were very complicated: economic, social, ethnic, political. However, today it seems obvious that the basic cause of the violence is religious hatred. The name ‘Boko Haram’ can be translated as ‘western education is sinful’, and a command to fight sin and immorality is, by its very nature, a religious command. The conclusion is that we must support those in Nigeria who are trying to oppose the religious fanatics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These explosive tensions between different communities demonstrate the powerlessness of the Nigerian Government. If stability is to be created, there will have to be dialogue between the religious groups and between the regions, but, above all, the rule of law must function so that these crimes do not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">Nigeria’s vast resources ought to have brought the country huge wealth, but the opposite has been the case. The oil appears to have brought nothing but problems, such as environmental pollution and the kidnapping of foreigners, and the profits have all been siphoned off to richer countries. But we, the European Union and its citizens, can play an important role in the stabilisation of Nigeria. If the profits from oil extraction did not all go to large international companies, like Shell, then the local population would also be able to benefit from this lucrative source of income. And if these large international companies were to duly pay their tax, then the government could become stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, we urgently need the Transparency Directive to come into being, as my fellow Member, Judith Sargentini, just said. Fairly distributed wealth is a guarantee of stability. In the new plans for the Union’s external policy, principles, such as democracy and rule of law, peace and security, occupy an important place. How the European Union, and the High Representative in particular, assists Nigeria with the current developments will make it clear, in practice, how much store we set by these principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to recall in this regard that there have also been extreme acts of violence in Nigeria in the past.</p>

In both cases, the government set up a commission of inquiry, which carried out an investigation and drew up a report. However, these investigation reports were not published and those responsible were not named in either 2009 or 2010, nor prior to that in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">These are serious failures, and therefore I would like to emphasise the call in our resolution for there to be independent investigations of these human rights violations, and for the perpetrators to then be given a fair trial, and this should include the perpetrators on all sides of the conflict.

Islamist extremists are attacking Christians and murdering them only because the Christians belong to a different religion and have a different culture, tradition and values. It is horrific that tragedies of this kind are taking place on such a large scale in today’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the first clashes between Muslims and Christians were noted as long ago as 1990 and, at the time, the international community unfortunately was not very consistent in its attitude. The effects of this passivity were in evidence last Sunday, for example, when Boko Haram terrorists placed bombs outside a church in Jos, murdering another 14 innocent people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the European Parliament must issue an unequivocal condemnation of Islamist terrorism and the attacks on Christians. Members should enlist the help of experts to draft a plan for extending support to the authorities in Nigeria in the fight to stop the bloodshed and reunite the country. There is no doubt that this is something which is missing today – strong condemnation of Islamist radicalism and its crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Africa's most populated country, 80% of its 170 million inhabitants are struggling in misery and poverty, although the country itself is not poor. Nigeria is the ninth largest oil exporter in the world but, at the same time, it is one of the most corrupt and poorly positioned countries in the UN human development index classification.

The actions of the terrorist group Boko Haram have become more and more violent. Thus, in November 2011, 65 people died in a series of bombings in Damaturu; on Christmas day, 44 people were killed in the attack committed in front of Sainte-Thérèse church of Abuja. The Friday evening bombings in Kano, in the north of the country, which led to the death of at least 185 people, are so far one of the most barbaric acts claimed by Boko Haram.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is known that Nigeria has been for decades the scene of clashes between Christians and Muslims. However, the aggravation of the security situation is now manifest and I think it can no longer be ignored. The actions of the Boko Haram group are threatening the stability of the whole country and many are wondering whether, at the moment, Nigeria is about to disappear. Therefore, our support is more than ever necessary to establish a climate of tolerance and respect for the freedom of religion in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to conclude by drawing attention to paragraph 7 of our common resolution: Boko Haram is threatening not only Nigeria, but the entire region, because of potential connections with AQMI. Therefore, we must encourage regional efforts aimed at preventing synergies between Boko Haram and AQMI. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 2009, we have been seeing a marked escalation in connection with the activity of the extreme Islamist sect which has been mentioned here many times. Since July 2009, it has been behind 160 bomb attacks against Christians in which over 900 people have been killed, including 44 last Christmas. The group aims to introduce Sharia law in all of Nigeria’s 36 states. It has launched a religious war against Christians and is threatening to drive them out of the north of the country, which makes Christians a very heavily persecuted religious group. In the Middle East, there is already the risk that Christian communities will disappear, and this may translate into a wave of migration to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Nigeria is one of political instability and corruption, factors which have led to an extremely uneven distribution of wealth. Nigeria has the second highest GDP in Africa and is an important supplier of crude oil to Europe, but a huge proportion of its population are trapped in poverty and have barely USD 2 a day on which to live. This provides the basis for the growth of religious fanaticism. The European Union should be striving to strengthen dialogue with the Nigerian Government, to bring it to put robust measures in place which will guarantee public order and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be the case, but it is nevertheless deplorable that an oil-rich country like Nigeria should be so thoroughly corrupt and that poverty should be so marked for a large number of people in a wealthy oil-rich country such as Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate here has highlighted the situation between Muslims and Christians. No one can deny that this is devastating and horrifying. It is currently the case that the EU is providing several million euro over a five-year period – almost EUR 680 million. It is clear that, in connection with this donation of aid, we expect resolute demands to be made – and I am convinced that the Commissioner is also making these demands – in respect of human rights and freedoms. I believe that we specifically need to emphasise freedom of religion, in particular, because the concept of human rights and freedoms can be seen as rather ‘limitless’. In Nigeria, but not only in Nigeria, it is about freedom of religion in particular. It is not only the group that has been mentioned here several times that we can turn to; we can approach the government itself. We must not be satisfied with simply expressing our opposition, as has been said here; we must also make demands. We know that Nigeria has a large population and it plays, and wants to play, a major role in Africa. That is something that this country certainly can do, but something more is required of its own government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent months, the extremist Islamic Boko Haram movement has carried out violent bomb attacks on civilians, government buildings and churches. The attack on a church during Christmas Mass was an inconceivably brutal act of terror. The purpose of these violent attacks against Christians is to put a strain on relations between Muslims and Christians and to make the current Nigerian leadership look incapable of maintaining the country’s unity and security. Muhammadu Buhari, the Muslim military leader in the north, has made an impressive display of criticising the efforts by President Goodluck Jonathan’s government to improve security as ineffectual.</p>
<p class="contents">Conditions are now ripe for the religious fanatics in the country. It is easy to persuade the enormous numbers of young, unemployed, excluded people in northern Nigeria to be involved in violent, extremist Islamic activity against Christians and, furthermore, western values. Boko Haram is also thought to have links with al-Qaeda. The security situation is also being affected by combatants returning home unemployed from North Africa, Mauritania, Chad and Libya and by illegal weapons flowing out of that region.

The first is the situation in Nigeria, a country that is involved with the ACP and with which we have good relations. Commissioner, you know better than I do how help is actually being provided here, and that we need to bear in mind that the government does, in actual, fact have a rich country on account of the deposits of raw materials, which, as Mr Šťastný said, should, in fact, be used to provide better social and living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to realise that Boko Haram puts forward arguments and acts in the same way as other Islamic groups and states do in their persecution of Christians. Seventy-five per cent of all instances of the persecution of people on account of their religious conviction currently involve the persecution of Christians. It is clear that the entire Islamic world – including the representatives of the Islamic faith, although they have no central institutions – is called on here finally to take action against such acts of violence and to clearly distance themselves from these acts. I believe that this is the only available course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">We have concerns in Syria and in Egypt and similar areas, and we know what the outcome was in Iraq, for example. For that reason, I believe that the fact that the External Action Service intends to appoint a Special Representative for Human Rights for this purpose is important, and, in this regard, the departments dealing with the persecution of Christians in particular must also be represented. This is not something that should only apply to Christians; we need to realise that it is relevant to all religious convictions, which must be permitted and must not be persecuted, but, as Europe, which is founded on Christianity, we should also have the opportunity to state very clearly that Christians must not be persecuted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first victims have been the country’s Christians. Northern Nigeria is the scene of religious cleansing and today, thousands of Nigerians have become the victims of aggression and murder. The introduction of Sharia law in further states will result not only in hostility, but also in discrimination against Christians over access to education, access to work and freedom to practise their religion.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must not be indifferent to these developments, which threaten to end in a major tragedy. Our diplomatic service and the Member States’ diplomatic services must do everything possible to protect Nigeria from the rising religious hostility.

We look forward to Parliament’s continued support for the European Union’s growing engagement with Nigeria. We will increase our contacts and cooperation with Nigeria, which is at a crucial juncture in its history. It faces serious problems, but there are also a lot of opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the Commission do in response to the troubles faced by Nigeria? Today, we are supporting Nigeria with EUR 200 million in the Niger Delta programme which is our support for fragile peace in the Delta. We are also considering how to support the northern Nigeria programme, where there are many development challenges. Just to mention one, education: northern Nigeria has some of the worst education indicators in the world with only 74% attending school and only about 5% finishing a full primary cycle. In effect, Boko Haram is deliberately depriving Nigerian children of the opportunity to better themselves, help their families and communities and find a way out of poverty. This means that engagement with Nigeria should be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union regularly raises issues about religious freedoms with Nigeria in the context of the human rights dialogue. The rights of Christians should not be seen independently from the rights of Muslims in the country. I believe that this dialogue on human rights will be strengthened in the future. The High Representative has already engaged a great deal and she has a couple of new proposals that were discussed during the informal meetings with Foreign Affairs Ministers held last week in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the European Union help Nigeria against Boko Haram? Following the ministerial meeting between the European Union and Nigeria, we have started to work on the package of support for Nigeria’s counter-terrorist methods. This will be additional to, and complementary with, the EU Member States’ action. It will focus on the root causes of radicalisation, especially poverty, marginalisation in society and lack of jobs. It will also have a dimension of justice and the rule of law. Nigeria is defining its own counter-terrorism strategy, which the EU will support fully, in accordance with human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the killing of two European hostages, I would just repeat the High Representative’s statement of 9 March: ‘I want to express my condolences to both families of the hostages in Nigeria for the tragic loss. We condemn in the strongest possible terms criminal actions like the taking of hostages. Perpetrators must be brought to justice and held accountable for their crimes’.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to emphasise concerns oil revenues. I believe that the Commission has now made a proposal for more transparency on the reporting of profits from natural wealth by the companies. I very much hope that this House will support these measures because we clearly understand that fighting against poverty also requires that all companies engage fully and transparently to report on the profits in a particular country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the EP is coming forward with its resolution on the social unrest and religiously motivated persecution of Christians in Nigeria. EP has repeatedly called on the EEAS to mainstream the aspect of freedom of religion and belief in its human rights dialogue with third countries and to train its staff on this. Religiously motivated intolerance in the world is on the rise and the EU has to step up its efforts to tackle this issue sooner rather than later. I call on the EU, together with the UN, to contribute to a peaceful settlement between the religious communities in Nigeria. It is our common interests to stop the spreading of violence towards Christian communities. Nigeria is among the resource richest countries in Africa with significant economic growth, but also among the most corrupt. The EU must, in its relations with Nigeria, seriously push for social and economic reforms that would channel the revenues from the oil industry for education and economic and social development, instead of re-distributing them among the elites.

I utterly condemn the suicide bombing of a service at St. Finbar’s Church in Jos on 11 March which killed at least four people. My sympathies are with the families of the dead and wounded and I call upon the Nigerian Federal and State governments to bring those behind the bombing to justice while doing more to protect vulnerable communities, especially Christians, in northern and central parts of the country. The EU must support stability in Nigeria. However, Nigeria must demonstrate its willingness to end religious strife as well as re-commit itself to guaranteeing basic human rights including freedom of religion. The Nigerian Government must intervene in cases of those tried under Sharia law, especially those sentenced to death, amputation, flogging or other inhuman treatments. I am particularly concerned about women who are being lashed for committing adultery, especially in instances of rape. Nigeria must also show respect for the rights of its LGBT community and reconsider legislation criminalising homosexuality, which, under Sharia law in the north, is punishable by stoning to death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
