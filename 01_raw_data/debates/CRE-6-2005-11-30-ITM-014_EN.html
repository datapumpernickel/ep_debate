<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markos Kyprianou, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I wish to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Parish and Mrs Figueiredo, for the excellent work they have done and the very swift time in which they have done it. This does credit to all the institutions and I am very confident this directive will be adopted before the end of the year. The concerns of European citizens over avian flu and the fact that we have had the first outbreaks in Europe have made it even more important to adopt this new, updated and more effective legislation as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know – and we had an opportunity to discuss the threat of a pandemic in this House some weeks ago – that avian flu is an animal disease. We have to take all possible measures to ensure that it remains so. It is very important to deal with this threat at source – i.e. birds – and this is the aim of this new, updated version of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is also of great importance for international cooperation. As I have informed Parliament in the past, I have visited South-East Asia, and in fact have just returned from there. The message there is very encouraging, because there is a political will and a strategy for dealing with this threat. However, there is also a need for international support and cooperation. We will offer that support, but we will also participate. The Commission is co-hosting the conference in Beijing with three international organisations, the OIE, FAO and WHO, as well as the World Bank, which will aim to coordinate international assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all distinguish between avian flu, which is an animal disease, and the possible threat of a pandemic. They are two separate issues. I know that in people’s minds there is confusion. They even confuse this with seasonal flu, which is another version of flu, but it is very important for people to distinguish between the two. However, that does not mean one should not take all the necessary precautions and steps to deal with the public health threat as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Avian flu is an existing situation, an existing threat. We have had cases in Europe, though fortunately not in the European Union, but these cases have been dealt with very effectively and efficiently by the countries involved. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Romania, Turkey and Croatia for cooperating very closely with us.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the suspected cases in Greece proved to be false alarms, so I am pleased to say that at this point we have not had any outbreaks in poultry in the European Union itself. Nevertheless, Member States have taken very strong measures and effective preventive measures which are constantly being updated and reviewed to ensure that they reflect current needs and circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">This revised directive aims for better prevention and eradication of outbreaks and to reduce health risks, costs and losses. It covers the low pathogenic version as well as the N2 pathogenic strain, but also introduces effective eradication measures, including vaccination, taking into account scientific evidence and experiences in Europe in recent years – I could mention the Netherlands case two years ago – and elsewhere in the world, and of course the need to avoid the large-scale slaughter and destruction of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal recognises that the avian influenza virus is largely unpredictable, and therefore that we must be able to take the appropriate proportionate measures to deal with this real situation as circumstances evolve. We also take into account animal welfare and ethical concerns, especially regarding the mass slaughter of animals. You will know that has caused understandable public reaction during past animal health crises. That is why we allow Member States, through this new proposal, the option of not applying a stamping-out policy in the event of an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza in poultry. This is why the co-financing for outbreaks of disease caused by low pathogenic virus is only 30%. This provision is aimed at discouraging Member States, whenever possible, from opting for stamping-out.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have mentioned, avian flu is public health concern and we are therefore taking all the necessary measures. The most effective way of doing this, as I have said already, is to tackle this virus at source. Although we are taking these measures and accept, and are responding to, the input of the European Parliament with regard to improving pandemic preparedness, we feel it inappropriate to introduce into the text of this directive those amendments that fall outside its scope – i.e. those concerning public and human health. This directive deals with animal health.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to inform you that two days ago the Commission adopted two plans with regard to public health, one on generic pandemic preparedness and the other on influenza pandemic preparedness. We also held the Common Ground joint simulation exercise last week to test our plans and those of the Member States. Introducing an effective animal health strategy will directly protect and benefit the poultry industry, but it will also indirectly protect human and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the amendments. Later I shall circulate a list of those amendments we accept and those which we do not. There are amendments in the report which we will be happy to accept, whereas others warrant full consideration as a matter of principle but in a different context, such as those on the financial aspects, research and support to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards research in particular, we are working with my colleague, Mr Potočnik, towards a proposal for research into this virus, about which we know little. I shall try to speed up this process. I hope that Parliament will support us in this. It is important to get the results of this research as soon as possible so that we can plan our response. I would be very interested to hear what Members here think. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neil Parish (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I am pleased that the Council has dealt with this item as a matter of urgency. I wish to thank the Commissioner and his staff for their cooperation and help. I also wish to thank the Council for its cooperation and help. I would stress, as the Commissioner did, that this proposal deals with animal health. The aim of the Commission proposal is to improve the control of low pathogenic avian influenza so as to prevent an outbreak of the high pathogenic type.</p>
<p class="contents">Once mutation into high pathogenic has occurred, the virus is extremely difficult to control. There is now a clear need to update current legislation to reflect new advances and our recent experiences in Europe and beyond, and I support the Commission’s attempt to do this. It is very important to get this legislation right in order to protect EU poultry and ensure that legislation is proportionate to the risk posed. We must be well prepared and not fall down the same traps as with the foot-and-mouth outbreak, when there was no proper contingency planning in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal aims to introduce compulsory surveillance for low pathogen avian influenza in all Member States. It spells out the measures to be taken in the event of an outbreak or suspected outbreak, allows new and more flexible provisions on vaccination – and I welcome that – and brings in a more flexible provision for domestic birds other than poultry, which will help in the case of zoos and endangered species. It also introduces new provisions to ensure cooperation between veterinary and public health authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">My report on the Commission proposal has added, I believe, some important new aspects that were not necessarily considered by the Commission. I have called on the Commission to assist in the development of a cost-efficient oral, multi-strain vaccine. Parliament has agreed to put money into the budget for this, and I welcome that. If an oral vaccine can be produced it will be far better for the welfare of the poultry. I would like a study to be conducted on the impact of migratory birds on the spread of the disease. I want to ensure that any outbreak or suspected outbreak is contained, notably by stopping the movements of poultry and other birds. Member States must keep all poultry farmers fully informed of contingency plans which, again, was not the case with foot-and-mouth disease. We must monitor flocks on the flight paths of wild birds.</p>
<p class="contents">I have amended the proposal to make the disease control measures tougher, notably where avian influenza is only suspected, and with respect to the movement of table and hatching eggs. I have also asked for risk-based flexibility in the application of certain measures so as to avoid unnecessary consequences for the poultry industry. I successfully introduced amendments to allow establishments such as zoos and wildlife parks to remain open, provided there is no threat to disease control.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I very much support the Commission’s proposal as regards monitoring for low pathogenic avian influenza and the slaughtering of these birds. However, despite the fact that it is scientifically proven that meat from chickens infected with low pathogenic avian influenza is safe for humans to eat, in practice it will almost be impossible to market such meat. We must maintain European consumers’ complete confidence in poultry meat and products. I fear that if meat potentially contaminated with low pathogenic avian influenza were to reach the food chain, it would damage consumer confidence in poultry meat and products in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I have retabled the amendments excluding LPAI-infected meat from the food chain, because I believe that this must be destroyed at this point. I urge the Commissioner to look at this carefully and see if we cannot adopt these measures that would take meat infected with low pathogenic avian influenza out of the circuit and have it destroyed. I should make it clear to the House that I am talking about meat infected with low pathogenic avian influenza, not about vaccinated meat, in case there is any confusion on that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would call upon all Members of this House to support these amendments and to get this regulation on the statute book as soon as possible so that we can put a proper contingency plan in place in the unfortunate event of an outbreak of avian influenza hitting Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That way, action can be taken promptly and the disease can be isolated and stopped from spreading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial, bearing in mind the potential consequences of an epidemic, that preventative action be taken effectively and promptly – albeit without causing public alarm – both here in the EU and in third countries, in particular Asian ones. Avian influenza is a worldwide phenomenon and affects most domesticated birds, yet its distribution is influenced by the relationship between domesticated birds and wild birds, the location of poultry farms, the routes taken by migratory birds and the time of year.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that vigilance and prevention are of the utmost importance, even in the case of low pathogenic viruses, which can mutate into the highly pathogenic strain after circulation for short periods in a poultry population. Furthermore, although it is rare for human beings to be infected, there have nonetheless been outbreaks among the human population in recent years caused by certain avian-influenza viruses, leading to dozens of fatalities in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and taking account of the opinions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Budgets, whose rapporteurs, Mr Sturdy and Mr Mulder, I wish to thank, the Committee on Agriculture emphasises the need to strengthen the Commission’s proposal on five crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, greater emphasis should be placed on prevention and monitoring, beginning with a survey of risk areas in each country, to head off the potential impact of an avian-influenza epidemic on public health. Secondly, greater Community support is needed to develop research into an oral vaccine to combat the various strains and to promote the use thereof should the need arise; the total cost of vaccines should be borne by the Community. Thirdly, Community support must be given to the Member States to develop a system for monitoring the disease, including laboratory diagnosis and research (particularly into suitable vaccines). Fourthly, measures should be taken involving cooperation and technical support for third countries, in particular Asian ones, in order to enable preventative and screening action to be taken in the countries in which avian influenza originates. Fifthly, aid must be made available to breeders facing a loss of income should the need arise to slaughter birds, the destruction of eggs, the cleaning and disinfection of holdings and equipment, the destruction of contaminated foodstuffs. The EU will partly cover the costs incurred by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned, the amount of financial assistance should total 50% of the costs borne by the Member States, in cases both of high and low pathogenic avian influenza, because if action needs to be taken and animals need to be slaughtered, the losses incurred are the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that in this case it is right to increase Community assistance to 60%, in line with my proposal, because if a Member State faces a situation of this nature having taken the necessary prevention measures, it deserves solidarity from the Community, and this may indeed help to prevent the disease from spreading.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also tabled a further proposal for which I am seeking your backing, ladies and gentlemen. I feel that social justice will be served if support is granted to poultry breeders whose holdings are affected by the disease, not only in respect of the costs and losses incurred, but also 50% in respect of loss of income until a new holding is up and running; this without of course undermining the workings of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to express my gratitude for all the help I received in drawing up this report, and I trust that the Commission and the Council will take due heed of Parliament’s proposals. If so, all possible measures can be taken to prevent and fight any outbreaks, and to ensure that the disease does not spread and affect public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am encouraged by what the Commissioner had to say. I think that they have learnt a great deal. I should like to thank both rapporteurs, Mr Parish and Mrs Figueiredo, for the hard work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Committee on Budgets is mainly concerned with the financial side of things, but that has not stopped it from mainly speaking out in favour of the first option that would take effect in the event of an outbreak, namely to give priority to renewed vaccination. In that respect, the Budgetary Committee has tabled two amendments for the 2006 budget relating to studies into the development of better vaccines and better testing methods and into the role of migratory birds in the spread of bird flu. We hope that the Commission will launch these studies as soon as possible and will not wait until the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major budgetary problems is that the agricultural budget will, in future, be stretched. Not that we would wish it, but it is to be expected that one day, we will face another outbreak of an infectious disease, whether it be bird flu or foot and mouth disease or some other, and money from the European budget will need to be made available to deal with it. The question is whether there is money in the kitty; there may well not be any, and so we think the Commission should, as a matter of urgency, continue looking into the possibility of a European animal health fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budgetary Committee’s second concern is that at the moment, half of compensation is accounted for by the European budget, while the other half is made up by the Member States. The way in which this latter 50% is raised varies from country to country. In some countries, the farmers pay; in others, they do not. This is not what we would call a level playing field, and the Commission should look into this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner on his openness with Parliament – that is a great attribute and very much appreciated by Members – as well as on his urgency and on the fact that he has not panicked. This has been a great attribute right the way through.</p>
<p class="contents">On a number of occasions he has asked Members to help him spread the word. I noticed that when he last visited Parliament, he asked MEPs to try to find out and spread the word in their Member States to gain awareness of what was happening. We are all happy to do this. Of course, we will need full information to continue to spread the word. The Health Council meets on 9 December 2005 and I hope this will make the situation clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to know what the situation is right across the board with Member States. I ask this because I understand that 21 Member States are already fully prepared and in a state of readiness. Could the Commissioner tell us which four Member States are not in that situation?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a party political issue. We want the Commission and the governments to come out of this looking good: we do not want to be accused of stupid, irresponsible measures. It is a great opportunity. We have seen what happened in France and the Netherlands and the fact that people do not trust the European Union, Parliament and the Commission. If we get this right – and I think the Commission is getting it right, but we need more information – we will do a very good job for promoting the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about transparency and making sure that everyone understands it. At the moment, a number of half-truths seem to be circulating. For example, I hear a lot about the European migratory system – the birds that migrate into the European Union. I recently visited one of those sites in the United Kingdom. In fact, all the migratory birds in the United Kingdom come from the north, not from an area where avian flu is present. It is this kind of information that, in my opinion, people are getting slightly wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned the disease and I would like to ask him another question. Avian flu – to the best of my knowledge – is an infection of the gut, not of the respiratory tract. I believe that is correct and I shall be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it correct that a child has already died – admittedly in the Far East – from eating infected meat? What are we going to do about the risk of that?</p>
<p class="contents">To return to migratory birds, I think hunters have a great opportunity to be used in this situation to keep us informed of the way things are. We must recognise that the way in which we are selling food in the European Union is a problem: supermarkets force down prices, thereby increasing the risk of a dangerous virus spread. We had a situation where foot-and-mouth came into the European Union. We do not know how it came in, but the Commission’s staff was very good at sorting it out. Swine vesicular disease came into the European Union, as did Newcastle Disease. Where did that come from and why did it come into the European Union? How are these diseases getting in? It is important to understand – wherever we import food from anywhere in the world – that there is always a risk of bringing a disease into the European Union. We must look at that very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
