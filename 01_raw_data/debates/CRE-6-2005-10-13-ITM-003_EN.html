<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean Marie Beaupuy (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to thank those in the Commission, Parliament and indeed the Council, with which I had some contact, who helped me draw up this own-initiative report. I hope that it will be adopted in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">What has got into Parliament to make it address urban issues, which are certainly not enshrined in our treaties and which do not usually fall within our competence? I feel that, in order to gain a proper understanding of the situation as it stands, it is worth taking a quick look back. Over the past half-century, our institutions have focused a great deal on tackling crucial headline issues such as, initially, coal and steel, the common agricultural policy, the Single Act – one of the cornerstones of our European organisation, enabling people, capital, goods and services to move freely throughout our countries – and then, more recently, the single currency. While these landmark events were taking place, our European organisation adopted thousands of measures relating to the citizens’ daily lives. Yet, despite all of this, we have not seen any coherent development regarding the urban and suburban areas where 3 700 000 people, 80% of the population, live. I wish to stress the terms urban and suburban.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, several important decisions have been taken over the past 15 to 20 years. The first of these decisions – and, no doubt, a significant one too – was taken in 1988, when Article 10 of the European Regional Development Fund specified the need for urban pilot projects. Two years later, in 1990, two documents were published: a Green Paper on the urban environment and a report on urban areas in crisis. In 1993, Jacques Delors organised a European symposium on cities. As regards the URBAN programme, which is the subject under discussion, the first programme appeared in 1994, followed by a second in 2000. Lastly, the URBACT data exchange programme came into being in 2004. In other words, the last 15 years has seen a steady trickle of programmes and measures on urban issues being adopted. I should also point out that, at the same time, in recent years, there have been many conferences, colloquiums and other fora on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, though, things have moved ahead altogether more quickly. On 30 November 2004 the Dutch Presidency held an informal Council in Rotterdam, which placed the accent on the urban dimension and adopted an outstanding text on the subject. I should also point out, in conjunction with my fellow members of the URBAN intergroup, that the URBAN-housing intergroup was set up in 2005. A large number of articles on urban policy have appeared in all the documents relating to the regional funds prepared by the Commission before 2004. In December, the British Presidency is set to host a meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol. We can see, therefore, that urban issues have come a long way.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the question before us today? What we see in our urban and suburban areas is a certain amount of waste. One Member of this House, who is here today, pointed out to us the other day, for example, that, in Leipzig, 30% of refurbished housing remains unoccupied. Is that not a huge waste? Have we not seen – thanks mainly to our regional funds, but also to national funds and local budgets – the occasional school built here and there without accommodation being refurbished, or vice versa, accommodation refurbished without infrastructure such as public transport being renovated? The time has come to put an end to such waste. The time has come for us to adopt a much more coherent policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, which has been the subject of lengthy debate, is not intended to set fresh objectives. We already have objectives. The purpose of this report is to equip us with the resources to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives in our towns and cities. What are those resources? I presume you have all read this own-initiative report. I should like to highlight some crucial points, such as the fact that our three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which prepares and implements legislation – need an internal shake-up so as to enhance the effectiveness of their decisions on urban issues. We are witnessing a power struggle between the Member States, the regions, the cities and indeed the EU, and these authorities must now work together much more coherently in order greatly to improve their own effectiveness once and for all. We need to develop urban policy that is integrated in both spatial and thematic terms. I have spoken about this from the perspective of the negative picture I painted earlier. We cannot implement a measure unless it works in tandem with other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by emphasising good practice. I often say that the awareness and application of tried and tested good practice is often far more productive than a small allocation of funds. Urban policy does not fall under Parliament’s powers. Let us not be under any illusion; Parliament is not about to release further vast sums of money in the framework of the financial perspective to fund new urban perspectives. Everything hinges on whether we can improve our organisation and our effectiveness. This is the proposal that I put to you in the various provisions contained in my report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danuta Hübner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Beaupuy for drawing up an excellent report. It suggests a number of very concrete steps which can be taken to reinforce work on urban issues within the context of enlargement in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. In particular I appreciate your strong support for strengthening the urban dimension in future cohesion policy. The motion for a resolution is clear proof of the European Parliament’s strong commitment and dedication to urban policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted with great interest your proposal to amend Annex VI to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development to incorporate the urban dimension. I am convinced that towns and cities play a central role in achieving greater competitiveness, more growth and more and better jobs in Europe. That is why we intend to place urban actions at the core of cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I share your view that urban planning should incorporate a wide spectrum of policies and develop integrated spatial and thematic urban policy on a human scale to ensure people-friendly cities. I agree with you that we must further reinforce urban policy development priorities. In fact, I have asked my services to prepare a detailed analysis on the contribution of cities to growth and jobs in the regions. A working paper will complement the Community strategic guidelines. It will also provide more specific guidance on how cities and regions can cooperate when preparing and implementing cohesion policy programmes. This document will also bring out more clearly those city-focused priorities which the Commission considers to be indispensable or highly promising in order to implement cohesion programmes successfully. As you know, a number of thematic priorities – such as the knowledge economy, social cohesion and urban environment – are set out in the draft Community strategic guidelines. Cities can make an important contribution to these.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my aim to discuss this document with Member States’ regions and cities. The debate will be opened at the UK informal Council on Sustainable Communities on 6 December in Bristol, where we will present our paper. Afterwards we will start a wide consultation, the results of which will be used to draw up the final version of the Community strategic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to an extensive exchange of views on this working paper on cities with the honourable Members of Parliament. This paper will also respond to your request to develop and propose models and tools for sustainable urban development. It will provide recommendations based on current good practice in promoting sustainable local communities through an integrated approach. Many lessons will be drawn from cities participating in our URBACT networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the thematic strategy for sustainable urban development, being prepared under the framework of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, will be a further step in enhancing dialogue between the Commission and national and local authorities. This thematic strategy on urban environment is currently scheduled for adoption by the Commission on 21 December 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Your motion for a resolution also calls on the Commission to move towards a horizontal application of the urban dimension and towards coordination between the departments of the Commission that are directly or indirectly concerned with urban issues. I can assure you that the services are already working in close collaboration on the urban content of the Community strategy guidelines. In the light of the results of this work, and after the adoption of the legislative framework for cohesion policy 2007-2013, we will assess the working practices with a view to ensuring efficient cross-service coordination on urban issues. My intention at this stage will be to establish an interdepartmental task force along the same lines as your Urban Housing Intergroup to ensure a horizontal approach to policy measures which affect cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you asked the Commission to ensure that intervention in towns and cities and urban agglomerations is strengthened. As you know, our proposal for the future cohesion policy programmes foresees that each Member State will present a list of urban areas that will benefit from specific assistance within the regional programmes. It also makes provision for sub-delegating the implementation of programme management to the cities themselves. However, unfortunately, as we all know, the Council has rendered these provisions optional, like a number of other measures in favour of cities, such as the consultation of urban authorities in the framework of partnership. I count very much on your support to convince the Member States to reinstate our initial ideas in the negotiations. The lack of strong commitment from the Member States would undermine our efforts towards strengthening the urban dimension in our policy and it would call into question some of our concrete initiatives, like the Urban Audit programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to tell you that there has been some progress on urban-related issues in the negotiations as well. The UK Presidency has proposed to turn urban sustainable development into a fully-fledged priority, in addition to those priorities proposed under the convergence and regional competitiveness objectives. Let me assure you that I have no doubts that we need both cities and regions if we want to achieve greater competitiveness, more growth and better jobs. I am also confident that the cities will receive the place in our policy which they deserve.</p>

<p class="contents">More importantly, if we are to achieve social and regional cohesion within the Union of 25 Member States and in the run-up to further enlargement, we need to study the various factors which affect life in towns and cities and propose coordinated and effective intervention through all our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur for his thoughts and proposals on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for incorporating our ideas. As you know, we maintain that the strategy for towns and cities must include a wide spectrum of policies and opportunities as regards transport, the environment, planning, economic activity, migration policy, public health, social integration and safety standards. Within this network of policies, the gender dimension must be taken into serious account. This means that women must participate in planning the humane towns that we all want to achieve; in other words, towns and cities that address the common problems of our fellow citizens, but that also address those that arise from the particular circumstances of the two sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Women, as we make clear in our opinion, face particular situations and various needs, in transport for example, in their everyday life. I therefore believe, Commissioner, that in consultation with local communities, to which you just referred, you will take account of the balanced participation of men and women in consultation fora.

I would just like to remind the House that it was this Parliament that campaigned for URBAN as a Community initiative and, in due course, made a successful job of implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of simplification, the existing URBAN dimension is now to be integrated into the mainstream programmes for the coming planning period for 2007 to 2013. That can definitely be advantageous provided that the URBAN dimension’s successful continuity is ensured. There is no doubt that urban areas are – as the rapporteur has highlighted – economic motors and key elements in regional development created within the EU. The fact that over 80% of economic activity goes on in towns and cities is as indispensable justification for the principle of partnership as one of the key elements in cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Urban and rural policy are dependent on each other; it is for that reason that they may not, in any one territory, be considered in isolation, even though there are extreme differences between rural and urban zones in the ten new Member States. What is remarkable about the cities of the central and eastern European states is the decline in their population, the phenomenon of emigration brought about by the decline of industry, and this is a process that the Eastern European states will have to master in exactly the same way as did the towns and cities of the former East Germany: as a consequence of the socialist era. This is where the Urban Dimension’s city policy, among others, could – indeed, must – have an effect. That is why the rapporteur’s balanced report deserves to be endorsed and its conclusions need to be followed up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report was explicitly drafted as a response to enlargement, which had made these problems even more acute. Let me just remind you that there are in the Central and Eastern European states vast districts full of buildings made of large panels, and with all the problems, both in building and social terms, that are associated with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the Structural Funds, though, there are scarcely any instruments capable of being used to address the problems of urban areas, so, while there are indeed means available to the new Member States whereby they may, with the help of the European Union, monitor and support their urban policies, I would stress that urban development is problematic not only in the new Member States, but also, of course, in the old ones. I see this as a topic that we will have to revisit in the future if we are, given the need for them, to develop instruments with which the European Union can address certain problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We may not – as Mr Beaupuy rightly said – have any powers or responsibilities where urban policy is concerned, but to act as if urban problems were not problems for Europe as a whole would be to ignore the facts of the situation, and so I agree with the rapporteur’s idea that urban policy should be given a broader, horizontal approach, with the Commission being called on to take appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think, though, that it makes a great deal of sense to proceed with great moderation when it comes to changing this House’s Rules of Procedure, and it is for that reason that my Group has tabled an amendment on the subject. Far from opposing urban policy, we are in fact very strongly in favour of it, but we are opposed to altering the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of amending the Rules of Procedure resurfaces from time to time, but I do believe that this would be the wrong way of going about decisions on urban policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might be permitted to touch on another point that may well not have any direct relevance to Mr Beaupuy’s report. Commissioner Hübner explained what the Council is working on at the moment. I can do no other than urge the Council and the Commission to come to a decision as quickly as possible on the Financial Perspective and thereby give us a framework, which should as soon as possible have the relevant projects attached to it, for if they do not, we will be unable to implement the Cohesion Policy for the period from January 2007 onwards and will be unable to deal with the problems in the new Member States’ urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a decision from the Council as soon as possible, and that decision should coincide as far as possible with those taken by Parliament.</p>

He was already doing so before the creation of the European Parliament’s Urban Housing Intergroup, of which he himself is Chairman and I a member, and which is working very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Commissioner for supporting in so timely a fashion the approach we take to our work, and for encouraging it. She demonstrated her support yet again just now in her speech to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, it is clear, is today requested to make an additional commitment – which I think I can guarantee, and I speak for Mr Beaupuy too – to involve itself more fully, with a view to preventing any disastrous backtracking by the Council. Backtracking would only reduce the role of cities, a role which, in my opinion, is not only an essential part of cohesion policy, but also represents one of its central pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">Cities are, in fact, the key players in regional policy. As well as being centres for the most complex issues, such as social exclusion and pollution, they are centres in which the futures of their entire surrounding areas are moulded, a fact I have also tried to assert in my role as shadow rapporteur on the European Regional Development Fund regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The driving force of a programme which sensibly invests and manages funds earmarked for cities can, and must, give a similar economic and socio-cultural boost to suburbs and surrounding rural areas, especially in the light of the recent enlargement of the European Union. That is why I believe that today we need to engage even more with this subject, based on the experience that this Parliament has already acquired. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much of what has been taken up into this report reflects the work of the urban planning Intergroup, of which the rapporteur is the chairman. Not only towns and regions, but also civil society, face both a major challenge and an excellent opportunity to communicate European policy and its objectives. In Leipzig, from which I come, programmes such as ‘Urban II’ have produced outstanding results, not least by getting the public involved. Direct participation makes possible a European perspective at the local level.</p>
<p class="contents">If we squander this potential, we cannot be surprised when many people in Europe see the decisions taken in Brussels or Strasbourg more as interference in their internal affairs than as forward-looking action. What is needed today is an all-embracing approach to urban planning, involving jobs no less than issues around suitability for children and senior citizens, the supply of affordable housing or the development of transport connections.</p>
<p class="contents">The urban dimension must, though, also become a horizontal task for the Commission’s Directorates-General, enabling it to be reflected in all policy areas. Whether with regard to the structural funds or to the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, European policy cannot really be successful unless the cities and regions are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">My ears pricked up at a recent survey according to which 75% of the cities and municipalities have no concept of what the Lisbon Strategy is. Particularly after what the Commissioner reported today, that should provide food for thought for our Member States, who may be willing to implement the partnership principle on a voluntary basis, but are not prepared to be bound by it. They are probably less inclined to share power.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore look forward with a great deal of eager anticipation to the analysis and the proposals on sustainable urban development that the Commissioner announced this afternoon. This is the way to really get European cohesion policy to work, and I look forward to continued good cooperation between the Commission, Parliament and, eventually, the Council too.</p>

<p class="contents">European towns and cities are still the places <span class="italic">par excellence </span>of creation and the centre of social and cultural development, as we can see from the attraction they exert over people. On the other hand, however, they are the places where numerous and varied problems are concentrated, such as environmental pollution, traffic congestion, housing problems, crime and drug addiction and social exclusion, immigration and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with reference to the report by Mr Beaupuy, I should like to comment on five points which I consider important. As a member of parliament from a country which became a Member State in the last enlargement, I cannot but welcome the effort of the Committee on Regional Development to address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point I should like to emphasise relates to the observation about the great disparities in terms of urban policy between the 25 Member States, particularly as a result of the enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which often have no clear and comprehensive urban policy at national or regional level. Although I agree with this recital, we must not forget that the same drawback also applies in numerous older Member States, where urban policy is an endangered species and towns and cities are being left at the mercy of some higher power. The effort, therefore, to address and find a viable solution to the problems which are the scourge of towns and cities must be a joint effort in all 25 Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which I should like to comment and which is of major importance to Member States with a rural economy, is that towns and cities or areas form part of regional territory, and hence sustainable urban development must be pursued in harmony with neighbouring rural zones. As you know, in numerous Member States, large rural zones often become isolated when neighbouring towns are deserted. We therefore need to step up our efforts to make smaller towns more attractive, so that, for example, villages are not deserted in favour of cities, as this can have negative repercussions on the rural economy of some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that over 80% of economic activity is exercised in towns and cities makes local authorities pillars of regional development. Therefore, regional development and urban development have now become interconnected concepts.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking as a starting point the principle that urban and rural zones form part of the region and that they are interactive and interdependent zones, our action must centre on upgrading rural areas in order to iron out differences between and balance the two zones.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, on another point, the rapporteur calls on the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament to propose an amendment to Annex VΙ of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development with a view to incorporating the urban dimension specifically, in addition to regional and cohesion policy, in its objectives and competencies, taking account of the work of the other committees concerned (transport, environment, research, employment and social affairs, internal market, culture and so on) in a horizontal approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This message is particularly important not only because it will increase the competencies of the committee in question, but also because it will send a message to the citizens that we are concerned, we are listening, we are paying attention to the problems of their daily life and we are trying to find viable solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I want to say that, instead of admitting the inadequacy of sustainable policies, what we are doing is to suggest that what is to blame is a lack of support for an outdated practice, which is contrary to the Lisbon policy and is not worthy of our efforts. We need to separate one term from the other and work – I repeat jointly – to make the vision of sustainable urban development a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the role of cities as development areas for knowledge and economic activity, it strikes me as useful to contemplate the specific impact cities have on attaining the Lisbon objectives. I am pleased that the rapporteur has devoted his attention to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the rapporteur is right in pointing out that both the Commission and the Member States can each in their own way contribute to the development of cities: the Commission by monitoring the side effects general economic and regional policy have on cities, and Member States by drawing up development plans for their cities and urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Although cross-fertilisation is necessary and possible in certain areas, this evaluation appears to be doing justice only to the fundamental powers of both Member States and the Commission. I can therefore warmly support his calls to the Member States for added consideration to urban policy, and warmly congratulate him on this fine report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As one of the previous speakers rightly said, town centres are becoming places where drug addicts, criminals and migrants congregate. The Council of Europe turned its attention to this problem some time ago, but with little success. There certainly are economic reasons for the death of these old town centres, but the so-called European social model has aggravated the situation further. Rents in town centres are cheap and controlled, and rents for subsidised premises on the outskirts are also low. Consequently, people prefer not to live in the centres, because it simply does not pay them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">If this policy remains unchanged so will the state of affairs, and the situation in town centres will steadily worsen. Even now, one only has to look upwards of an evening in cities such as Brussels, Strasbourg, Venice, Rome and Florence to see the dark windows of uninhabited buildings that have usually been well maintained. People do not wish to live in them because it does not pay them to do so. There are also demographic reasons for this state of affairs. The population of Europe is decreasing and this means people do not wish to live in the old town centres where criminals and drug addicts are concentrated. If things are not put right and the economic and demographic conditions remain unchanged, nothing will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth keeping in mind that all this is the result of the so-called European social model. Nonetheless, it suffices for someone to venture to make the least comment on the subject of this notorious social model in the House for all hell to be let loose against them. Members will recall the statements made yesterday by Commissioner McCreevy on the matter. The Commissioner had Europe’s own interests at heart when he indicated that Europe had to become competitive and efficient, and that it cannot allow itself to be as social as it is and would like to be. At least, that is what I gleaned from how his statements were reported. The outcome was that Commissioner McCreevy was summoned to appear before the House. This is not the way to build Europe and it is not the way to save our beautiful old historic town centres either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eighty per cent of the world’s population will be concentrated in densely urbanised areas of the planet, bringing us close to the <span class="italic">ecumenopolis </span>posited by the geographer Constantinos Doxiadis in the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="contents">Another geographer of international repute, Jean Gottmann, described the spread of another pattern of settlement and urban development – the megalopolis – as exemplified today by the urban sprawls on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and in Southern China and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">The phenomenon of massive urban expansion is also underway on the coast of California, in India – between Delhi and Calcutta – as well as in Europe, along the Rhine axis of the Ruhr, which runs from Germany to the Netherlands, and in Italy’s industrial triangle of Milan-Genoa-Turin. I will stop there or the list of examples will grow too long.</p>
<p class="contents">These are huge demographic melting pots of often very different cultures and social groups. These highly artificial constructs suffer from constant energy and environmental imbalances, as well as worsening problems of communication, water supply, social tension and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike closed natural systems, these artificial ecosystems are configured as open systems. They should therefore try to sustain themselves by focusing on certain priorities: reduction of waste production and improved recycling of resources; and planning of efficient horizontal dimensions, which depend not only on what a city produces and how it produces it, but also on how a city interacts with other urban centres and surrounding suburban or rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Beaupuy is surely right to highlight in his report the importance of urban partnership networks, at both interregional and cross-border levels. The dimensions of the problems encountered are spread over such a broad spatial area that it is only through an integrated approach to investment and administration – we might define it as the great urban basin – that we can hope effectively to tackle them. We need to find a way of making sure we do not move from the reality of a ‘megalopolis’ to the reality of a ‘necropolis’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, it would be absurd for the policy of the Structural Funds to ignore the problems of towns and cities, be they unemployment, crime or quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Parliament has always shown an interest in the problems of towns and cities, both small and large, and in 1999, I would remind you, the Community URBAN initiative was maintained at the insistence of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Beaupuy report underlines this interest and sends the message to the European Commission and the Council that we need to show an increased interest from now on in the problems of towns and cities.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Structural Fund regulations integrate the Community URBAN initiative into the basic programmes. This is something the European Parliament welcomes and is supporting in its negotiations with the Council on the new Structural Fund regulations for the period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we shall try in these negotiations to highlight the urban dimension even more, by emphasising the call for it to include a list of towns and cities which will be covered by the Structural Fund programmes for all the Member States for the period from 2007 to 2013, in order to make action by Member States on towns and cities more specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we are waiting for the guidelines from the European Commission in order to ascertain how the interest of the European Union in towns and cities is being specialised, including through the guidelines, and we are here to support specific proposals by the European Commission, while remaining faithful at all times to the line which the European Parliament took a great many years ago.</p>

We agreed fairly early on that the problems affecting towns and cities in the new Member States are no different from those that have affected – and to a large extent continue to affect – urban centres in countries that became Member States much earlier. I mention this merely to confirm how similar we in fact are.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that Parliament is addressing the issue of towns and cities and large agglomerations and I hope that this initiative will meet with a commensurate response from the Commission in the form of practical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As I discovered in discussions with representatives from Czech towns and cities – and I have no reason to doubt that the situation is similar in the other new Member States – the most pressing problems include sizeable investment deficit inherited from previous years, property inherited from the army, transport and regenerating industrial waste ground and pre-fabricated housing estates; I could go on in this vein.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that towns and municipalities are important stakeholders in the EU’s cohesion policy. Between 2000 and 2006 some EUR 30 billion was earmarked for towns and cities, and I firmly believe that that figure will be exceeded in the forthcoming financial perspective 2007 – 2013. Some people complain of the red tape involved in submitting projects and applications for appropriations from the European funds. I should like to remind those people that we are talking about the money of European taxpayers, our fellow European citizens, and we must accordingly establish clear rules and exercise a certain degree of caution when dealing with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of the worst deprivation, the most severe needs and the biggest environmental challenges are indeed found in our towns and cities. However, I say to Mr Libicki that they are also the source of Europe’s greatest dynamism, prosperity and cultural richness. We pay the bills. I can and do argue to my eight million constituents in London – a figure, incidentally, which makes us a city state larger than 11 Member States but without the equivalent representation – that they should pay for sustainable rural development. However, I cannot and will not persuade them that their hard-earned tax money should assist the purchase of another Mercedes for a cereal baron. Nor can I honestly explain to them why the interests of the 80% majority are so overlooked in EU policy. That is why I so welcome Mr Beaupuy’s report and indeed his leadership of the Urban and Housing Intergroup in this Parliament. I also welcome Commissioner Hubner’s promise of a study on the contribution of cities to regional development and the UK Presidency’s apparent intentions to make urban development a specific objective. It is a pity the Presidency is not represented here today.</p>
<p class="contents">My own particular concern is with the impact of justice and security policies on urban areas. Asylum and immigration, and policies on tackling crime and terrorism, are of crucial concern to cities. It is here that most migrants arrive. It is among the ethnic minority communities of cities like London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels that we seek cooperation to counter terrorist threats, but where alienation and poverty are sources of tension which repressive policing will only inflame.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be grateful if the rapporteur is able – as he has kindly indicated that he wishes to do – to make some small oral amendments to mention justice, security and liberty policies in his excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To date, there has been a conspicuous lack of cohesive European policy on urban-related issues, although over three quarters of the Union’s citizens live in urban areas. Today’s debate is therefore indicative of genuine realism. I am delighted a document of this nature has been drafted. I am also pleased to note that it contains references to the European Urban Charter and the New Athens Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, matters relating to cities cannot ever be considered without reference to the surroundings of the cities that constitute urban agglomerations. It is also important to keep in mind the existence of extensive rural areas. Throughout history, the development of cities has acted as a catalyst to the development of whole regions and conversely, the deterioration of the former has led to the downfall of the latter. This is still the case, particularly as regards regional capitals, or in other words local metropolitan centres. It therefore makes sense to include the urban environment in the strategic objectives for regional development, and consequently to provide for full participation in the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">There certainly are some challenging specific issues relating to municipal engineering. They include urban transport, the supply of energy and water, waste water treatment and waste recycling. Cities have many other roles to play too, however, and I should like to mention education and the promotion of culture in particular. Cities must also deal with a whole range of social issues. Nowadays these include serious security matters, unemployment, and the death of city centres mentioned previously by Mr Libicki.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to recall what Pope John Paul II once said to representatives of Italian cities, as it links in with the human aspect referred to by the Commissioner. The Holy Father stated that a city cannot be an end in itself. Its end should be the service of human beings, to which cities should adjust their structures and governing principles. He went on to say that public authorities should guard against losing sight of this truth, for fear of becoming like a machine that hums uselessly and is likely to cause injury. Let us all therefore strive to be useful, be it in the House, in the Commission, in the Council or in any of the cities in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under Urban II in my constituency in Northern Ireland, we benefited from a very worthwhile programme in North Belfast. However, with Urban II coming to an end, a similar need in highly deprived areas in East and South Belfast remains unmet. These are some of the areas which featured most prominently in recent street disturbances and which show high levels of deprivation and neglect. They need far-reaching and tangible help.</p>
<p class="contents">I note in terms of the future that the legislative proposal for regional policy from 2007 explicitly embraces an urban dimension and, within the competitiveness and employment objective for which my region will qualify, there is a commitment to concentrate on areas which have the most serious problems. Thus, in terms of those deprived areas of Belfast that I have mentioned, I certainly will be looking for a meaningful programme of assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the last 30 years the main focus in terms of the implementation of policy objectives has been on economic and social cohesion. The outcome of the actions undertaken indicates the need to include territorial cohesion amongst these objectives. In the broader context of the problems arising concerning the relationship between centres and peripheries and between metropolitan areas and small centres of population for example, the issue of urban development is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to the Lisbon Strategy, cities are to become centres for innovative activities intended to promote development. They are therefore set to become the potential engines of development in the European Union. At the same time, however, it is in those very cities that increasing internal disparities have been noted, together with a worrying increase in social problems and even the social exclusion of certain groups. Special attention should therefore be paid to cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I earnestly hope that due regard will be paid to urban-related issues in all Community policies, not just in cohesion policy. In particular, I believe it is necessary to recognise the need for it to be mandatory to include the urban dimension in the implementation of cohesion policy tasks in the Objective I framework and also in Objective II regions<span class="italic">.</span> It would also be appropriate to delegate authority for project management to city level when a city’s own regeneration programmes are being implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Towns and cities play an important role in the social, economic and cultural life of Europe. There is something paradoxical today about European towns and cities and urban areas, in which 78% of the population live.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, they are levers for development in an ever-increasingly competitive global economy, concentrating wealth, knowledge and know-how. They are also centres for the provision of public services, such as education, health care and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, most of the most serious problems of our modern society are located in towns and cities: acute problems of poverty and social exclusion, deterioration in the natural and man-made environment, lack of green spaces and atmospheric pollution, loss of local identity and higher crime rates. At the same time, more acute problems of racism are appearing in our towns and cities.</p>
<p class="contents">The connection between regional development and urban development is clear and cannot be ignored in the efforts which we are making to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion. Our towns and cities are not isolated. All towns and cities, irrespective of size, together with the suburban and rural areas surrounding them, constitute the driving force of each region and can play a central role within the framework of the implementation of the revised Lisbon or Gothenburg objectives. That is why the need to manage the urban question at European level is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Policy on towns and cities needs to be at the epicentre of efforts to achieve a strong, competitive and viable Europe, while maintaining social cohesion. In the new programming period, the policies which contribute to the development of the territorial systems of Europe will need to demonstrate complementarity, coordination and consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, coordination is needed of efforts by all partners at local, regional, national and European level, with the proper utilisation of the potential of towns and cities for sustainable development.</p>

I am Mayor of Tolfa – a delightful small town north of Rome – and even in this capacity have been able to see how significantly economic development and social dimensions are affected when citizens gather and integrate into an urban whole. Our cities are embracing more and more varied realities – different nationalities, disparate requirements, problems on various levels – and as such act as a microcosm of what is taking place on a macroeconomic level across the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise, therefore, how actions aimed at fostering integration and social, economic and environmental development can have a correspondingly positive effect on citizens, which is then translated into added value for the European Union. Each modest success, in fact, can only help create citizens who are more mature, more open-minded and more European, and who are equipped to understand the challenges they face, and to continue along the path embarked upon in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Extending a hand to the cities of the new Member States is therefore a vital means of creating the equality to which the EU aspires for all its Member States. In that way, all types of friction and inequality may at last be overcome, for the sake of the unified project of a Europe particularly conscious of the problems faced by minorities and by the most disadvantaged groups in the least developed regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cities, therefore, constitute the backdrop against which the majority of the inhabitants of the European Union live.</p>
<p class="contents">Lately we have witnessed a certain downplaying of the importance of the urban dimension within cohesion policy, and so this report completely changes that particular approach, which we were not able to support.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be forgotten that in the heart of the Europe of 15 we also find the so-called Pentagon, that is, a zone linking London, Paris, Milan, Berlin and Hamburg in which a large proportion of the economy and population of Europe is concentrated. The Pentagon idea is of course completely opposed to the concept of territorial cohesion, as set out in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which stresses cities – especially small and medium-sized ones – as key players in regional development and in achieving the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst acknowledging, therefore, the practical difficulties the new countries have faced, and must continue to face, we must remember that even the cities of the old Member States had to be integrated into the system and territory of the Community.</p>

<p class="contents">Following enlargement and bearing in mind the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria, it is obvious that now, more than ever, a pan-European strategy is needed in order to address the challenges of increased disparities in terms of urban policy between the Members of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country and in most of the new Member States, there are serious large-scale problems that need to be clearly addressed with comprehensive interventions such as economic and social actions, aimed at the revitalisation of deteriorated inner cities and the renovation of large post-war prefabricated housing estates.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of these problems do not only relate to the new Member States, even if in these countries the situation is worse than elsewhere in the Union. In the new Member States, around 40% of the urban population lives in these deteriorated areas, creating ghettos within our cities. Beside the disastrous social and economic consequences of this deterioration, environmental aspects should also be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the new Member States and cities are simply unable to deal with these challenges on their own. The newly proposed regulation only allows for a very limited scope of intervention for integrated urban actions. Thus, the fate of the deteriorating inner city areas and the large housing estates will only get worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody agrees that cities and urban agglomerations or areas have a central role to play in achieving the revitalisation and Göteborg objectives. It is also clear that cities and urban agglomerations play a major role in achieving regional development objectives. It is therefore of the utmost importance seriously to strengthen the urban dimension within the mainstream structure of EU programmes. Strengthening the urban dimension does not mean that we are requesting more money. On the contrary, we are calling for more flexibility and for the possibility to spend the available money on the most pressing and important issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to take on board that in the newly-enlarged Europe there are over 73 000 local authorities, and it is those working in the local authorities who are the first to gauge the reaction of EU citizens and to deal with the immediate consequences of the proposals made by us in the European institutions or in national government. When it comes to urban policy, then this is the case twice over. The first people to be approached should always be the mayors of towns and communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We presumably agree that holding debates with all local authorities is, from a budgetary point of view, virtually impossible. We could easily hold debates, however, with the associations to which they belong. In the Czech Republic, for example, the Union of Towns and Municipalities covers almost three quarters of the population of the Czech Republic, and provides a platform for dialogue between the local authorities and the government. This follows a recently concluded cooperation agreement, according to which the government is required to submit to the Union all newly proposed policies relating to the communities for comment, and in turn discuss those comments with the communities. Dialogue of this nature would be beneficial to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The national local authority associations come under the umbrella of European associations. Here in Brussels, for example, a few dozen metres from the Parliament building are the headquarters of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. I mention this so that we may take advantage of the potential of such umbrella organisations and cooperate more with them. As regards urban policy, we have an early opportunity during the debate on the role of towns in the revamped structural policy for 2007 – 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is symbolic that we are discussing the issue of the urban dimension of the EU during the European Week of Regions and Cities in Brussels. I should therefore like to call on the Committee of the Regions and the Commission to support this initiative, which involves the towns and cities themselves. For proper dialogue to take place, however, our partners require time and space to be able to make their contribution, and we need time and space to be able to make good use of their contributions, and in turn to improve the quality of the laws and initiatives on which we are working.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Beaupuy, for his work on this initiative, which, to my mind, takes account of the actual needs of Europe’s towns and communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly desirable if we remember that approximately 80% of the population of the European Union live in towns or cities, as has been emphasised several times already in this House today. Cities are crucial to regional development and also to attaining the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. It is cities and the areas surrounding them that generate growth and innovation plus economic, social and territorial cohesion. It is also the case, however, that the most complex problems tend to be concentrated in the cities. I have in mind social exclusion, spatial and ethnic segregation, violence, drugs, pollution, unemployment and illegal trading.</p>
<p class="contents">There are marked discrepancies between European Union countries regarding urban policy, particularly after the most recent enlargement and the accession of 10 new Member States. These discrepancies are partly due to the different degree of economic development and partly also to the fact that certain new Member States do not have an urban policy in place at national or regional level. It is particularly in the new Member States that complex urban problems have been noted, relating amongst other issues to management of the housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, transport, protection of the natural environment and waste disposal. In addition, it is mainly in the new Member States that the most notable cases of problems caused by social exclusion or by living in neglected prefabricated slab housing estates can be found. That is why effective action to regenerate post-industrial premises is vital for those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission should waste no time in taking efficient action aimed at coordinating urban policy. In particular, the Commission should prioritise the development of tools for urban development, the exchange of best practice and experience and joint projects that strengthen interregional and transnational cooperation. Only then will it become possible for these cities that are new to the Union to become assets to it instead of liabilities, hence the importance of Mr Beaupuy’s report. I support it and would like to thank him very much for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I would like to thank the rapporteur for what I think is an excellent report. 78% of us live in cities. The nice thing about cities is that they are a common European phenomenon and even anti-Europeans such as Mr Allister could support Urban II. That is already a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, given that we have the Commissioner for Regional Affairs here, is to focus not only on urban affairs but other affairs towards the Baltic Sea region as well. That is perhaps something that the Commissioner and DG REGIO could look at, in other words, the fact that we have eight countries with a whole bunch of big old Hanseatic cities now surrounding the Baltic Sea area. Perhaps they could think of a Baltic Sea strategy along those lines. I would also like to stress that cities are the most important growth, innovation, economic, social and regional centres that we have and therefore the focus should be on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address my final point to my friend Mr Libicki in reference to yesterday’s debate about what Mr McCreevy said or did not say. I am Finnish and I come from a ‘welfare’ system. Whatever Mr McCreevy said, I think what we did yesterday was in many ways wrong. The World Economic Forum ranks Finland as the most competitive economy in the world, Sweden as the third and Denmark as the fourth, but I can guarantee one thing: the last person I want to have preaching to me about competitiveness is a German Socialist in the form of Mr Schulz!</p>

It was a pleasure to listen to Commissioner Hübner’s speech this morning, in which she made specific commitments to the effect that we can look forward to a new framework as early as at December’s informal Council. I unreservedly endorse this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jacques Delors used to speak about the Europe of the regions. If we were to draw up the balance sheet right now, it would be the Europe of the regions and the cities. Last year, I helped initiate a study in which we compared eight countries, eight regions and eight urban poles of development. This involved cities such as Milan, Dublin, Bristol and Nantes, and showed that it is the best possible cooperation between the region and the city that leads to the best results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important that this same cohesion, and not competence, should be the basis of any analysis. Cohesion between the region and between the cities, good governance and multi-level governance offer the best prospects. I have noticed that in Europe, even in my own region, a new synthesis is developing: hierarchy is making way for synergy.</p>
<p class="contents">My region comprises <span class="italic">Brabantstad</span>, a large area encompassing five cities that have joined forces. Good regional policy also implies good urban policy. That being the case, I should like to revisit this notion when the regulations are laid down later on in the year. Drawing up urban lists to promote the programmes is a fine thing, provided that it does not lead to fragmentation. In summary, given that cities are the pioneers in their regions socially and economically, it is useful if we in the Committee on Regional Development could review the clarification of the Committee’s role in the urban dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commissioner has indicated that she wants to give this urban dimension even more prominence in the regulations. I would like to ask her if she could say anything about this during this sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, we wish him a speedy recovery, so that he may be back on his feet as soon as possible and able to make use of his right to speak in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Casa’s behalf, let me thank Mr Beaupuy for his fine report. I think we are all aware that towns and cities have to be the focus of any future regional policy, being, so to speak, the epicentres of the problems with which our regional policies will have to deal. We know that 80% of people live in conurbations, that more and more people are moving to towns and cities, and that the problems associated with that are becoming more acute.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of using our regional policy to keep the rural areas around our cities attractive, and to prevent this flow into the cities necessarily devolves upon Europe, so the European Union, in the period of time between 2007 and 2013, must not only come up with rational policies, not only for cities, but also for rural areas, particularly in mountainous and isolated regions, in order to be able to offer the people who live there proper conditions under which to work. That should not mean, though, that we should neglect the towns and cities, for many of the problems that arise in them could be resolved with the help and support of the European Union, and so we should use benchmarking as a means of highlighting which solutions make sense for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr Stubb on what he had to say. All of us in Central Europe look northwards, if not exactly with admiration, at any rate with very warm sentiments, and are in fact glad that these states have managed to maintain the European social model. I would go along entirely with what he had to say about our Socialist Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have listened very carefully. Mrs Krehl raised the point of the financial perspective. All I can say is that I could not agree more. I think Europe is simply unable to absorb a longer period of uncertainty without very strong negative political, economic and social consequences, and that is why the lack of a good decision in December will cause damage that European citizens cannot afford anymore.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the debate on the urban dimension, I see that debate as a broad and strong support to this need to strengthen the urban dimension in our cohesion policy. Once again I want to say how much I appreciate the efforts of Mr Beaupuy and of the other Members of the Parliament who worked with him. I also want to assure you that we look at cities and towns on a Europe-wide basis. We look at all the problems and all the contributions of Europe-wide cities and towns and the contribution to the change in Europe. We are also aware of how much we can learn from towns and cities in Europe. There is an enormous amount of best practice which we have taken from the Urban Programme and I hope we will be able to use it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Two or three specific issues were also raised. One is the gender issue and the issue of equal status between men and women. In this context I would like to say two things. One, with regard to regulation, we have the provisions in the general regulation, but – also in response to many of your comments – what we have done over the last weeks when revising the position of the Commission was to propose adding the gender dimension for the first time in the history of cohesion policy to the ERDF regulation. It has not yet been approved by the Commission, but I hope it will be a major step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that we will take into account the gender dimension in our consultation on the working paper on urban issues which we are currently working on.</p>
<p class="contents">Housing was mentioned in different contexts. As you know, the housing issue is among those few issues which are still outstanding in the negotiations in the Council, in addition to some other very difficult issues on which Parliament has also voted, including cofinancing rates and eligibility of VAT. My understanding is that these questions will be solved in the context of the debate on the financial perspective, not in the context of the negotiations on the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Baltic Sea area, I want to say that within the current Interreg Programme it is one of the best – if not the best – performing programmes. I also hope that in the future we will have under the third objective this Baltic zone for transnational dimension. It is under major threat because, as you know, the budget proposal under the Luxembourg Presidency for the European territorial corporation objective in particular as regards the transnational dimension has been drastically reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the report. In response to Mr van Nistelrooij, with regard to timing, we are working on the document on urban issues. We will I think start this or next week interservice consultations in the Commission. I hope I will be able to say something when I come in November to the meeting with Mr Beaupuy’s group, but generally all I can say at this stage is that we would like to have the first discussion with the Member States already in December and then, as I have said, continue the consultations until more or less March. Then, maybe – but we will have to discuss this – sometime around March we could have a joint conference on those issues. However, we have to discuss it and see what we can do together.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly look forward to further cooperation with your Intergroup on urban and housing issues and I once again thank you very much for the discussion today.</p>
