<p class="contents">We have discovered, in effect, that in the Commission’s work programme for 2003, it was intending to submit a directive on postal services which would seek to separate legally, in other words to turn into subsidiaries, the commercial activities on the one hand and the public-service activities on the other, without consulting Parliament or the Council, in other words by using the procedure laid down in Article 86(3) of the Treaties. This method of procedure therefore amounts to breaking away from what has always been the legal basis for discussions about postal services within the Union, in other words Article 95, which is essentially a codecision procedure and therefore makes any decision on the matter the subject of a democratic debate. If this assumption were to prove to be true, it would of course be a recourse to force which we would be unable to accept. We have examined several postal directives which all form part of the gradual process of opening up the market, and we do not see any reason for resorting to force in this way, which I repeat would be intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask you, Commissioner, whether the Commission intends to confirm this assumption, in other words to change the legal basis so as to avoid any democratic debate before the Member States and before the representatives of the people. Secondly, I should like to know what the content of this draft is, since you have given us, very precisely, during this debate, the opportunity to do so. In fact, since we know that the area concerned will gradually disappear between now and 2009, we do not see how it could be the subject of subsidiary creation or legal separation. Finally, we should like to know the motivation behind this draft text which at the moment seems to us to be extremely confused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vermeer (ELDR). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to apologise for Mr Sterckx's absence. I wish him well in Sunday's elections. I do not like nuclear options, to use the term adopted by someone in Mr Bolkestein's cabinet to refer to Mr Monti's proposal to force the postal market to split its activities. Only recently did I find out that nuclear options or nuclear explosions are not always dangerous. Thailand is about to decide on digging a canal right across the country, just like the Suez or Panama Canal. This mechanical excavation work would certainly cost 20 billion. The Japanese are very interested because this would save them USD 300 000 annually if oil tankers heading for Japan would no longer need to pass through the perilous strait of Malacca. The Japanese subsequently suggested helping to build it by removing a number of difficult mountains along the way by means of a few friendly nuclear explosions. This would cut down the building costs to 3 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the nuclear option does not always cause as much damage as we imagine. The Commission has applied Article 86 before, notably in the early nineties, to the telecom sector. This worked well then. The liberalisation of the telecom sector is still known as one of the most appealing successes of European policy of the nineties.</p>
<p class="contents">To me, Mr Monti's proposal is therefore aimed at the Council, which will now have to take some serious decisions concerning the liberalisation of the postal services. The fact that the EP is being by-passed with this proposal is not easy for me, and cannot be dismissed just like that. Nevertheless, together with the European Commission, I am turning my gaze to the Council, for they are the ones that matter in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the universal provision of services by postal companies, Mr Bolkestein once mentioned the compensation fund which could be a purely mechanical way of solving the problem of cross-subsidisation at the coalface. It will therefore remain possible, Monsieur Savary, to send a letter to the remotest corner of Provence. Does the Commission intend to table further proposals in this area? Would a compensation fund of this kind then be able to run parallel to the Commission's recent proposal?</p>
<p class="contents">As for the plans to impose VAT on public post office services, I should like to point out that these post offices can also deduct the VAT from services they would need to pay for. In addition, the plans provide for the possibility of charging a lower VAT rate. With reparations and new-fangled proposals of this kind, we will not achieve a sufficiently effective and decisive policy in Europe in a hurry, not to mention the Lisbon objectives. Surely we wanted a dynamic Europe? Let us, then, try to send out a signal that the European Parliament will make every effort to give this economic sector in Europe, which is currently in difficult waters, a shot in the arm. I do hope that we will stand united and attach more importance to the goal that we want to achieve than to these methods, which may be needed just once to make true progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to have the opportunity, speaking also on behalf of my colleague, Mr Monti, to summarise and explain our policy to Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">In its work programme for this year, the Commission had, subsequent to recent competition decisions regarding the postal sector, foreseen to reflect on introducing more transparency in the relationship between incumbents' activities inside and outside the universal service in the postal sector. The Commission is at present still evaluating this question.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as you know, the Commission will be publishing in the coming months a Green Paper on services of general interest. Given the wide debate which has already accompanied this initiative and that will certainly follow the publication of the Green Paper, the Commission would like to re-evaluate its proposal for a directive on transparency in postal services in the light of the results of the above-mentioned debate. Therefore, the Commission has decided to withdraw it from its work programme for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, whatever the result of this further analysis, should the Commission decide to go on with the project, this evaluation will not result in the introduction of new, substantive obligations for postal operators but only in transparency obligations to enable the Commission to monitor anti-competitive practices throughout the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would not normally rise to speak on this issue, which is handled very competently by my colleague Mr Ferber, who is one of the most vigorous champions of postal service liberalisation, but who also works tirelessly to ensure that the customer's interests and rights and consumer protection are taken seriously in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have risen today because I believe that we really must press hard – as my fellow Members have pointed out – to ensure absolute transparency. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the plans that she has announced. However, it must be said that such transparency has often been, and continues to be, sorely missed in both the Commission and especially the Council, although, of course, we also demand absolute transparency from the postal services as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, and I fully endorse what my fellow Members have said on this issue, we of course need Parliament to be in a strong position in terms of its legal status. We need codecision. We must be quite clear about this, because no one else, apart from this House, represents the interests of postal service users adequately. I would like to make one thing quite clear: the reports which have appeared in the media in the last few days – my fellow Member has already mentioned them – which claim that value added tax is to be imposed on postage stamps really are designed to generate anti-European feeling among European Union citizens. I really do urge you to bury these plans as swiftly as possible. I do not mean that you should play them down, I mean that you should bury them. I do not think that it is the European Union's task to put forward this type of proposal, which is completely half-baked and really only has an impact on consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me say this: we must ensure – and this too has already been mentioned – that the postal services, notwithstanding all the liberalisation which we are trying to achieve, of course also continue to have a key social function. As we know, our society is increasingly fragmenting into those who can make dynamic use of modern technology and those who cannot. We must not forget the people in peripheral regions, the socially weak, and the increasing numbers of old people. The age pyramid is turning on its head. In many Member States, the postal systems seem to combine all the disadvantages of the old state monopolies with the shortcomings of the new liberalised market, instead of creating synergies by drawing on the positive aspects of both new systems. This clearly demonstrates the problems associated with the current transition period, especially for customers, as well as the serious lack of transparency. Let me give you just one example: <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span> removed large numbers of post boxes throughout Germany by stealth. In my electoral district, there is a hotel called '<span class="italic">Zur Post</span>', which has provided postal services for centuries. Overnight, its post box was dismantled, causing damage to the building's façade. The licensee, whose family has operated a posthouse in conjunction with the hotel for centuries, was deliberately not informed. Just imagine the scenario: so many post boxes have been removed that the ones in Munich are now overflowing. It has actually become impossible to post a letter in the city centre at certain times of the day: the number of post boxes has been cut back to such an extent that they are completely full by the afternoon. That is not competition. That is not customer-friendly conduct. It shows that there is also still a tendency to think in terms of the old monopoly structures while ruthlessly ignoring what was perhaps their social dimension, namely the provision of a service to citizens and a service to customers.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we need as much market as possible, as quickly as possible. We need as much transparency as possible as quickly as possible. However, we also need minimum standards of consumer protection in areas where the market alone cannot regulate the problems that arise, which means the areas I have described, in particular. I therefore believe that it is essential to press ahead with this process, not only through communications and Green Papers and so forth, but by working in close cooperation with the European Parliament on a legal basis which enables us, the only legitimate representatives of the European citizens and hence the postal service users, properly to monitor this complex process, which profoundly affects the life of every individual, and ensure that it is economically profitable, socially just, and compatible with people's needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear, as you have just said, that you have found an escape route via the Green Paper on services of general interest. Nevertheless, the intention was, and still is, to break away, if possible, from Parliament and the Member States, in order to impose a directive which actually comes down to dismantling the postal service. We must learn to call a spade a spade.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to echo what Mr Posselt said, though his argument was somewhat paradoxical. He is in favour of liberalisation, but deplores the fact that post offices are being closed down and that the public postal service is deteriorating. Yet this is inevitable. It is clear that a public service cannot be profitable, particularly when it has to ensure an equal service in highly populated areas and in regions which are much more sparsely populated. If we divide up the public service and want to turn it into a centre of profit, that will mean the end of the public postal service, the end of any postal presence throughout the territory, and the end of the social nature of this sector. That is why – and I would ask you, Commissioner, to pass on this message to Messrs Monti and Bolkestein – we are intransigent. We are intransigent in our support for the democratic principle which you are seeking to circumvent and to flout, by changing the legal basis and by trying to avoid Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that democracy is a dreadful bore for all executives, but it is, nonetheless, a proof of civilisation. We will naturally be prepared to go much further if the Commission persists in its attempt and in its desire to pursue its liberal offensive by breaking away from the people and their representatives. I can tell you this, Commissioner, we would not hesitate to contest the legal basis, before the Court of Justice of the European Communities, if Mr Bolkestein persists in this disastrous project, which is no surprise to us, coming as it does from him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, and I think that other Members here today feel the same, we are not at all sure whether your colleagues, and in particular Mr Bolkestein, have briefed you adequately, and entirely transparently, with regard to their intentions. Those intentions, which I would describe as secret, because we have the impression of not knowing exactly what they are, seem to consist of continuing with the dismantling of the European postal services without going via the European Parliament. That is the matter at issue here: the Commission is acting outside the codecision procedure, in other words circumventing the compulsory route via the European Parliament in order to legislate on the future of the European postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to repeat the many arguments that we have already set out here, on numerous occasions, in order to defend public services and the European postal services, to explain – once again other Members have drawn attention to it ahead of me – the essential role played by the public postal service today in keeping our regions alive. We are sticking to those arguments, because this is the message that the citizens of Europe are sending us and it is our job to maintain that position.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot help but take note of the Commission’s reply, but what it says to us is that the Commission has withdrawn its programme for this year. Does that mean that this matter will be transferred to next year’s programme? There is always, as I have pointed out, the possibility that the Commission will go back to its draft following the Green Paper. What would that mean? Nothing is clear! We are certainly not reassured by this, particularly since, as I have just said to you, we are perfectly well aware of Mr Bolkestein’s intentions. It is essential, therefore, to proceed via legal channels, in other words via a European directive that can be discussed here, so that we can see what the Commission’s real intentions are.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to you, Commissioner, that what is at stake here is respect for the work of each one of us, respect for the work of the Commission and respect for the work of Parliament, which represents our citizens. I should also like to emphasise, once again, because we have the feeling that the message has not been fully understood, that postal services, as Mr Savary has already said, are something that our citizens rely on. We cannot, therefore, endorse any draft which does not go through the procedure of a directive discussed in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the whole debate will continue within the context of the launching of the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to clarify that this initiative was launched against the backdrop of competition concerns regarding the postal sector brought to light in recent European case law and by the Commission. From the outset, this initiative was conceived as a means of enforcing competition law and not as a legislative measure. We are fully aware of the limits of the power of the Commission and of the European Union in what we can decide in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Commission considered on the one hand that the situation in the postal market could engender various forms of abusive behaviour by public postal operators. On the other hand, it considered it would be worth exploring whether extending the transparency requirements in question to all incumbents might adequately assuage these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate will definitely continue. I will of course also make sure that my colleague, Mario Monti, is informed of all your best arguments, and we will have an opportunity to come back to this discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
