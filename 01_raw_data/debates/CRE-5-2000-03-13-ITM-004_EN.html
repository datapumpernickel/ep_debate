The aim of the regulation under discussion today is to establish measures designed to promote the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests in developing countries, in order to guarantee the funding necessary to maintain and make progress with the actions and projects which have been under way for this purpose since the adoption of Regulation 3062, valid until December 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the financial instrument by means of which the Union can fulfil the obligations arising from the Agreement on biodiversity, the Framework Agreement on climate change and the Agreement on the fight against desertification. All these agreements indicate that developing countries must be supported in the search for solutions to the problem of their forest resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1990 and 1995, over 56 million hectares of forest, distributed unevenly in various parts of the world, were lost but, without a doubt, this particularly affected developing countries as a result of the increased amount of land used for agricultural purposes, the construction of infrastructures, or due to natural disasters and fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore facing a problem of the first magnitude, not only for developing countries, but also for the whole planet and all the living beings that inhabit it, a problem that Parliament has already spoken about at first reading at the end of the previous legislature on 5 May 1999. Since then, a long, and sometimes difficult, negotiation process has been taking place within the Council, which did not reach a common position until December 1999, and between the Council, the Commission and Parliament itself, in search of the necessary consensus. All this took place under the restrictions caused by the approval of a budget which imposed limitations in various respects, and in particular the need to allocate funding to implement the special plan for the reconstruction of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, Parliament approved a total of 34 amendments of which the Council, in its common position, has totally or partially taken up 18. Of the remaining 16, some, and in particular Amendments Nos 5 and 6, are no longer relevant following the interinstitutional agreement on the 2000 budget. The debate and negotiations that we have held with the Council and the Commission have focused on three topics: the budget, dates and comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur particularly wishes to highlight the hard work and flexibility shown by all concerned in the search for a consensus on the budget, so that, from an initial figure of EUR 9 million from the B7-6201 line, which implied a total of EUR 73 million for the whole period, we have reached an agreement that implies the provision of EUR 249 million for the next seven years as a whole, starting with the EUR 30 million already stipulated in the budget for the year 2000. Based on this budgetary agreement, which includes an agreement on dates, the differences have focused on aspects of comitology derived from the historic positions of Parliament and the Council itself that, with a view to the future, in my opinion – and not to insist on the problems made manifest in Mr Wijkman's intervention – I believe that they should be revised in an interinstitutional agreement in order to speed up the parliamentary legislative procedure and make it more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to request the support of the House with regard to Amendments Nos 1, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, and a negative vote for the others, which, if successful, would break the agreement reached during the discussions with the Commission and the Council, which would oblige the whole negotiating process to begin again, paralyse some of the actions and projects under way and undoubtedly cause serious problems in the policy of conservation and rehabilitation of the tropical forests that we are trying to develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, as with all budget lines, it is very important to discuss the funding these budget lines represent. As with the previous report, I am not happy that the duration is limited, but the very many projects put at risk are a good reason to reach an agreement with the Council as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as with Mr Wijkman's report, I agree with the rapporteur on the split comitology, meaning that the strategic guidelines will be decided under a management procedure while there will be an advisory committee for project implementation. One point which is of really fundamental importance to me is made in various amendments – for example, Amendments Nos 2 and 4 – which emphasise the active participation of forest peoples and the indigenous population. I believe that this is an absolutely fundamental point, especially when we are talking about the sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you for that. But we also all know only too well that not all projects are as successful as we would like them to be. This makes it all the more important, in our view, for both the people concerned on the spot and local groups to be involved, as early as the preliminary planning stage, in decisions such as how projects are to be organised, so as to ensure that these projects – which of course we wish to fund – are sustainable from an ecological and social, but also cultural, point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always the case – and we are aware of this too – that the interests of local people are respected; instead they are often subordinated and sacrificed to the economic interests of particular groups, such as for example multinational logging companies. There is a lot that I could say about Brazil in this context, about how interests of this kind are represented there, because one thing is clear: the issue of whether tropical forests can be used sustainably at all, without their being permanently damaged in the process, is still not satisfactorily settled. It is precisely here that there should be no cut in the Commission and the Council's contributions, because that would almost certainly be counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">This is because if the forests continue to be damaged to the same extent as they have been up until now, the local people will be the first to suffer and then we will all suffer throughout the whole world, because dramatic changes in climate can of course already be identified. It is also very important for us now for the projects to be able to continue to run without interruption. The demands we are making of the Council are not after all demands which we have plucked out of thin air, and I believe that it ought to be possible through skilful negotiation to secure something here, because the conditions are not after all impossible to meet. Otherwise we can only endorse Mr Fernández Martín's report; the comments made by Mrs Scheele and others are also a perfect reflection of our own thoughts. Thank you very much for this generous gift to my colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The biodiversity of our planet is at stake. The Commission has thus acted appropriately in proposing a new Council regulation on tropical forests and I fully subscribe to the thrust of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, the pinpoint relevance of whose work I salute. He has identified some valid points, certain aspects of which I would like to examine more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem to me absolutely essential to reflect on the scope of the regulation. Firstly, programmes must be more closely targeted at the rehabilitation of tropical forests. The Council regulation of 1995 perhaps focused in too exclusive a manner on the protection of tropical forests and not sufficiently closely on the harnessing of their productive potential. Besides this, future Community actions must take into consideration every facet of sustainable forest management. This implies respect for the indigenous peoples who depend on forest ecosystems. One should never overlook the fact that there are major obstacles to the indispensable involvement of these vulnerable communities: the forest areas in question are often the scene of unrest and conflict or suffer from the adverse impact of tourism, which all too often is held up as a miracle cure, and of local laws on forests which are hardly ever enforced, even where they actually exist.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, forests in which there are no production activities of any type, but there are also forests that continue to fulfil an economic function. This is the case with our own forests within the European Union, and I would ask my fellow Members what Community aid was provided for European forests after they were decimated by the storm that raged last December? We must without doubt take up the challenges laid down in this report, but must also institute a genuine Community policy on conservation and sustainable management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For these and other reasons, Europe's citizens rightly expect the Community to support actions to conserve and sustainably manage tropical forests.</p>
<p class="contents">I say tropical forests, but in fact a new feature of this regulation compared to the previous one is that the scope of the regulation now covers all developing countries and hence now includes countries such as South Africa, China and the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account. We have just discussed the environment regulation and the comments I made then on a number of horizontal issues are also largely applicable to the forest regulation. For this reason, I will be brief.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the amendments listed in the Fernández Martín report, the Commission's position on the main horizontal issues is as follows. Financial reference account: the Commission accepts the compromise figure of EUR 249 million over seven years proposed in Amendment No 9. Comitology – the Commission supports in principle Amendment No 11 but prefers the wording of Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15. The amendments propose a split comitology arrangement with annual guidelines and priorities being subject to a management procedure while Council would examine projects over EUR 2 million under an advisory procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Duration of the regulation: in order to avoid conciliation, the Commission's position is not to support Amendment No 12, which places an unlimited duration on the regulations. In our view the seven-year duration proposed by Council represents an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Bank guarantees: the Commission does not support Amendment No 8 concerning bank guarantees for reasons outlined earlier. We are against special provisions being made in specific budget lines as this goes against our common objective, namely, to simplify and unify administrative procedures. Furthermore, following a Commission decision in 1999, we consider that the issue has been largely resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the other amendments, our position is as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes and supports Amendments Nos 7 and 10. Amendment No 4 is considered acceptable. We do not support Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 6 as we consider that the concepts have been taken into account elsewhere in the regulation following the first reading. Hence, in the interest of clear and concise legislation, we would prefer that these amendments be dropped. Amendment No 1 is not supported as in our opinion it brings little added value. Given the Council's negative position on this amendment, the Commission would favour it also being dropped. Finally, we do not support Amendment No 5 as the term 'serious doubts' is considered to be too subjective, making it very difficult to implement the regulation. Furthermore, the objective of this amendment, namely, to avoid projects with negative social, cultural or economic or environmental effects, is addressed in Article 4 (5) on impact assessments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
