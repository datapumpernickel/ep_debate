<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as we meet to discuss the situation throughout the Middle East today, tensions in the region are high – and understandably so. The killing of the Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and seven other Palestinians by Israeli forces last week has resulted in outrage across the region. The European Union condemned this extrajudicial killing as contrary to international law. In an already inflamed situation, it is vital that all sides exercise restraint and refrain from acts of violence which will only lead to more deaths and which will put a peaceful settlement further beyond reach. Against this backdrop, the Arab League Summit scheduled for this week in Tunis has been cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, more than ever before, there is a need for the countries of the region to choose the path of peace and to turn away from the path of violence and recrimination. There is a need for governments to show leadership for peace, and to turn away from the politics of the last atrocity, which serve no one’s interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere in the region, in Iraq the security situation remains a cause of grave concern. It is disturbing that recent attacks have aimed at maximising civilian casualties and have been intended to promote sectarian violence. A secure, democratic and peaceful Iraq, within its present borders, can exert a positive influence for peace and stability across the entire region. The European Union looks forward to the transition to a representative Iraqi administration and is committed to working with the people of Iraq in securing a peaceful and stable future for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a pressing need for action to address the various problems and challenges to peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East. I believe that the European Union is ideally placed to make a contribution in support of this objective. Historically, the European Union has enjoyed a close relationship with the countries of the southern Mediterranean and the Middle East, built up through centuries of intertwined history, commerce and exchange. We are not strangers to each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, through Euromed and the Barcelona Process, the Union has enjoyed a structured relationship with countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean for ten years. The Barcelona framework is comprehensive in scope – covering political, economic, social and security issues of mutual interest. It commits us to working towards a shared zone of peace, prosperity and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic sphere we are working towards the establishment of a free trade zone with a market of 700 million people by 2010. The possibilities offered by this vast market will lead to a growth in employment, prosperity and stability right across the partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has also concluded Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with all but one of the Euromed countries, and I hope that the negotiations with the remaining country will be concluded soon so that the grid of arrangements can be completed. I would urge all partners to expedite ratification of these agreements, which are an important instrument in developing economic relationships between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An important element of our engagement has also been to promote democracy, good governance and the rule of law. This is in line with the conclusions drawn by the 2002 UNDP Arab Human Development Report. Significant funding has already been made available by the Commission in support of programmes which promote these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has also developed a framework of cooperation and dialogue with the countries of the Gulf through the Gulf Cooperation Council. At present we are working with our partners in the GCC to achieve a free trade agreement. Although negotiations have been long, and at times difficult, they are now moving in the right direction. In addition we are considering ways to develop relationships with Yemen and Libya, and reflecting on our relationship with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Union already has a deep and close relationship with the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is one based on partnership and dialogue, and on a willingness to work together to address the challenges facing the region. It is also a relationship that is based on the recognition of the strategic importance which each represents to the other. We are their neighbours just as they are our neighbours, and it is in our shared interest to see a zone of security, prosperity and progress develop across the wider region.</p>
<p class="contents">In recognition of the importance of the region to Europe, the European Union is currently working to develop a Strategic Partnership with the Middle East and the Mediterranean following a mandate from the European Council in December 2003. This is also a key objective of the European Security Strategy, again adopted in December 2003. Security and stability is a shared interest of the countries of the region and of the European Union. We need to do more to address the causes of instability which afflict the region – causes which include lack of economic development, under-developed educational opportunities and the need to promote open societies and economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Our primary objective is to promote the development, through partnership, of a common zone of peace, prosperity and progress across the Mediterranean and into the Middle East. The goal is to enjoy close and cooperative relations with all the countries of the region, responding as far as possible to initiatives from within the region itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is a strategic priority. However, reform in the region should not be conditional on progress in the Middle East Peace Process – or vice versa – but both objects should be pursued in tandem. This is the context that informed the adoption of the interim report presented to last week’s General Affairs and External Relations Council and endorsed by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The interim report proposes an EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It sets out a series of shared understandings held by the members of the Union with regard to relations with the region, proposes key principles and objectives which might inform our strategic partnership and proposes these together with work programmes for the Mediterranean and the Gulf as a means to implement our partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that the impetus for reform comes from within. There is already much being done, both at governmental level and by civil society. It is for the region itself to work out an appropriate way forward. Equally, there can be no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to the challenges facing the region. We are actively consulting with partners in the region who are our key interlocutors. This will be an essential element in preparing our final report for the European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, in his capacity as President of the European Council, had planned to address the Arab League Summit in Tunis yesterday, as a further step in our intensified consultations with the region. But, as I have already noted, that meeting was cancelled. Foreign Minister Cowen is currently in the region, holding a series of meetings with key interlocutors. The presidency's commitment to consultation and dialogue remains absolute. We will continue this process at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Mid-Term Ministerial Meeting to be held in Dublin and at the Ministerial Meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already commented on the need for progress in the Middle East Peace Process. There can be no long-term solution in the region without the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict which has cost so many lives on all sides. Implementation of the Quartet Roadmap remains the basis for reaching a lasting comprehensive settlement resulting in two viable, sovereign and independent states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. As members of the Quartet, we will continue to work towards this end. Acts of violence by either side cannot contribute to advancing the political process necessary to reach such a settlement, and such acts, therefore, must be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East are facing a broad range of challenges politically, economically and socially. Equally, those countries possess enormous potential which, if fulfilled, would result in benefits for all the peoples of the region. Progress in all areas – economics, commerce, education, democracy and civil society – is essential if the conditions for lasting peace and stability across the region are to be achieved. The European Union is committed to working as good neighbours with the governments and peoples of the region towards this end, which is in all our shared interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, may I first thank Parliament for making time for this debate. There are so many other things which Parliament has to discuss, but it is exceptionally important that today we should have a chance to discuss the Mediterranean and the Middle East because the directions we set for our policies in this region in the coming months should be thoroughly discussed and debated here; they involve fundamental decisions on how we are going to develop our relationship with our neighbours; and they involve fundamental decisions which will affect the whole relationship for the first part of this century between Europe and the Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">My friend and colleague from the presidency has explained very clearly the principles in the interim report adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the European Union last week and he explained how, through a series of intensive consultations with the region, they will form the basis of a concrete work programme to be presented to the European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to underline that we are not starting from scratch: rather, we are building on a comprehensive partnership with the Mediterranean countries and a set of bilateral relations with the countries east of Jordan. We will continue to develop our partnership on the basis of these existing instruments. I would add here that Europe is the most significant player in the region. The Community now spends close to EUR 1 billion a year in the region in promoting economic reforms, sectoral reform, institutional and political reform and in supporting sustainable development across the region, including our specific funds for supporting the Palestinians and for the reconstruction of Iraq. If one adds in the lending from the European Investment Bank, it makes a total of around EUR 2.5 billion a year. Furthermore, the European Union is the biggest trading partner for every country in the region except Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">So with this level of involvement, why has economic development and political reform been so slow to take off around the Mediterranean? Why is the human development gap still so great? The answer is two-fold: first of all, our approach is a long-term one which bears fruit incrementally, but I would venture that working on the basis of partnership, consultation and ownership of the reform process by reformers in the region will give us more solid and sustainable results than any attempts to impose democracy from the outside, whether through lectures or through the barrel of a gun. But secondly, and crucially, it is important to remember that the Barcelona process was formulated in an atmosphere of optimism, in the aftermath of the Oslo agreements. Stalemate in the peace process in the Middle East has time and again stymied progress on reform. Recent events are another sad but powerful confirmation that, as our report put it, it will not be possible to build a common zone of peace, prosperity and progress unless a just and lasting settlement of the conflict is in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again – and I am afraid I have had to say this all too often in speeches in this Chamber – we stand before the smoking ruins of the peace process. And this at a time when we had some hope of movement: the cancelled Arab League Summit was expected to provide a positive impetus to the peace process by relaunching its Beirut peace initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">How, I wonder – and I expect this question comes to the minds of many honourable Members – has Sheikh Yassin's assassination helped to improve the security of the Israeli people? How has it contributed to even the stated goal of a peaceful and consensual withdrawal from Gaza? I thought, and I still hope, that we had already seen the worst of the atrocities carried out by suicide bombers. But what we have witnessed lately is wickedness beyond imagination: for example, a frightened adolescent, explosives strapped to his body, is told that he will go to heaven and is sent out to kill himself and others at a military checkpoint. It is despicable and it is cowardly. What kind of world have we created when 12-year-olds are out on murder missions like that rather than playing football or doing their homework? And what are the circumstances? What is the environment that creates this culture of death and murderous recrimination?</p>
<p class="contents">My broader point is that if we are serious about wanting reform in the Arab World then, as the European Security Strategy states, resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict remains a strategic priority. It is what philosophers would call a necessary but not sufficient condition. Progress cannot be a pre-condition for confronting the challenges of reform, nor vice versa. But to attempt one without the other is, in my view, only too likely to prove a recipe for failure on both counts.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret, then, that the Arab League summit could not take place as planned, not least because it was expected to adopt a common declaration on domestic reform which would have been an important staging post in developing our common agenda. But working in this part of the world means, almost by definition, that one has to remain hopeful, so I hope that our Arab partners will be able to come together again soon. We are certainly prepared to do what we can to help.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we now have a European Union position which we can take into consultations with the region with some confidence of generating new momentum in our relations with our Mediterranean and Middle Eastern neighbours. Insofar as that is true, we are very grateful to the Irish presidency for the creative work it has done, both intellectually and diplomatically.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that our friends across the Atlantic are recognising that our long-term, consensus-building approach has some value, based, as it is, on building common agendas that respect differences of approach in different countries and regions. The Greater Middle East initiative from the United States generated controversy in the region, mainly because the objectives appeared to have been set without any real consultation process with the region. In the furore surrounding this, few paid attention to the substance. In content, what they are suggesting could involve the development of American policy towards the region based on the kind of comprehensive and long-term engagement which we have been advocating and trying to implement for many years. We have much to talk about with officials in Washington if they are prepared to match this commitment with appropriate levels of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Time will tell, but whatever the results, the European Union should focus on developing its own strategic partnership with the region. If we are successful, I believe we can make a significant contribution to fighting terrorism in Europe and in the region, one that is as important as the proposals to strengthen the European Union's internal security that I know will be discussed by Parliament tomorrow. It will take us another step down the road towards a central objective of the EU’s Security Strategy, namely: 'to promote a ring of well-governed countries … on the borders of the Mediterranean with whom we can enjoy close and cooperative relations'.</p>
<p class="contents">I make one final point which builds on what I have just said. We spent last Thursday and Friday in the Council discussing what this extraordinary circle of democracies in Europe can do to protect our way of life, our prosperity, our values, our belief in the rule of law and in civil liberties and the lives of our citizens; and what we can do in Europe to prevent more of the terrorist atrocities which have driven daggers into the hearts of many European families.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many things we have to do internally. There are many things we have to do in the areas of police and judicial cooperation. I have no doubt whatsoever that one of the most important things we have to do is to work more energetically, more creatively, day and night, to try to bring peace to the Middle East. The conflict does not justify anything any terrorist ever does and a number of terrorists and those who support terrorists use the plight of Palestinians and use the position in the Middle East as a wicked justification for the misery and mayhem they create. That is true. It is also true that one should not appease terrorism. It is true that there are important security aspects involved. But we all recognise as well that to bring peace to the Middle East would remove one of the causes of alienation in country after country which helps to provide a breeding ground for terrorism and for the murderous ideas that terrorists espouse.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope that we will be able to work more enthusiastically and more successfully to bring peace to the Middle East, and that the beneficiaries of that peace will not only be the people of Israel and the people of Palestine, but the people of Europe and the wider world as well.</p>

Indeed, it builds precisely on the long-term perspective mentioned in the last two speeches. It is a partnership of 240 Members of Parliament: 120 from the partner states and the southern shore of the Mediterranean, 120 from the EU national parliaments and the European Parliament. We have still to fill in the personnel, but we have established the outline of the bureaux and the composition of three working committees which will prepare future parliamentary assembly work – a Political Affairs Committee, an Economic Affairs Committee and a Social Affairs and Cultural Exchange Committee. It is an important parliamentary aspect and a good platform to build on.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the timing was such that both of the speakers here today – the Council and the Commission – were tied up with the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels preparing the summit meeting and were unable to participate. Both institutions acknowledged the launch of this Assembly and both wished it well. We need as a Parliament to ensure that future meetings are arranged at a time to enable the Council and the Commission to participate, because the parliamentary part is, and can be, an invaluable long-term development and communications platform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This session marked the culmination of the efforts made immediately after 11 September 2001 to reach, on both sides of the Mediterranean, a better mutual understanding and to dispel the spectre of war between civilisations, which is a potential consequence of the downward spiral of blood and vengeance into which the barbaric supporters of indiscriminate terrorism are attempting to drag us.</p>
<p class="contents">Still reeling from the shock of the images of 11 March in Madrid, it was on the morning of 22 March that we learned, President Cox, of the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, with all the consequences this could have. This gave us another reason to reiterate, in the presence of the official delegations from Israel and Palestine, the urgent need to find a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in which they are embroiled and to emphasise how important it is for the European Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to launch that strategic partnership for a common future with the Middle East on the subject of which you have just addressed us. Let us be aware on our side of the Mediterranean that our future and that of our children and grandchildren will depend on the way in which we have been able to extend to Africa in general and to the Middle East in particular, that area of peace and stability that our founding fathers were able to establish on our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore resolve to have more influence in the negotiations in progress within the Quartet, since we well know – as you said, Commissioner Patten – that Europe can and must now play a decisive role there. Whether or not we wanted it to be, the United States is considered, rightly or wrongly, to have taken Israel’s side. Russia does not have the same interests as ourselves, stemming from our geographical proximity to the region, and the United Nations does not have our means to act. If we Europeans were finally to speak with the powerful voice expected of us, there is no doubt it would be heard. I am sure that the will to do so exists in our Parliament, as this debate will once again prove, quite simply because it reflects the will of a very large majority of our fellow European citizens. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, can we begin to hope that this will might finally manifest itself other than through pious wishes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was not one of our best friends, his assassination is a clear and flagrant violation of international law. They could have arrested him and tried him. I would also point out that we have created an International Criminal Court which must have a role to play, although it is not supported by some States, including Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">We roundly condemn the assassination of the Hamas leader and other Palestinians, on the direct orders of a government, the government of Israel. We also roundly condemn the murders and terrorist acts aimed against the civilian populations of both parties to the conflict and I believe we must appeal to the Palestinians not to respond with a murderous increase in terrorist acts and more bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">This assassination has already had very grave consequences, including the suspension of the Arab League Summit. In this regard, I would like to express my agreement with the severe judgment of Shimon Peres in the Knesset when he said that this action would bring even more serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">There must therefore be an end to this policy of continuing to build the wall within the occupied territories, of ordering extra-judicial executions and, furthermore, there must be a withdrawal from Gaza, to which the current Israeli Government has clearly committed itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say on behalf of my group that the repeated violations of human rights, non-compliance with the latest United Nations resolutions on the part of the Israeli Government and, above all, Ariel Sharon’s insistence on renewing executions outside the framework of international law, will leave us with no other option than to reiterate the positions adopted by this House in its Resolution of 10 April 2002 and to call on the Commission and the Council to strictly apply the second article of our Association Agreement. We do not want to go that far, but we believe that we must issue a solemn and severe warning.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to make three requests: the first is to urge Israeli civil society, that vibrant Israeli society, and all its political parties, while defending its right to its own security, to demand that its government act in accordance with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would call on the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to urge those Member States of the European Union which sit on the United Nations Security Council to immediately present a proposal to establish an international intervention force on the 1967 borders, with the mandate of protecting both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, that the Commission continue with its aid, with the European Union’s aid, to assist the Palestinian National Authority to be strengthened and reformed, because a strong interlocutor is required if we are to argue that there must be a Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the whole of this process must come within the framework of the proposals being made to resolve the problem of the Middle East. It is clear that in order to resolve such a bitter and profound conflict, it is better to propose peace than to begin new wars and increase the cycle of violence, above all in a situation in which the stability of those regimes which could contribute to supporting a process of reform is being broken. I therefore believe that we must restart and reinforce a process in which the European Union, the United States – which also has a serious responsibility – the Arab League and all the countries of the region can continue along the lines of the statement on a common future for the Middle East recently proposed by the German Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Fischer, and in which the European Union, the region’s main partner, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, could contribute many elements in relation to peace treaties, security, arms control, disarmament, respect for human rights and democracy and economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that the European Parliament has done its bit with the creation, at last, of the Athens Parliamentary Assembly, and we have a duty, not only political but also moral, to continue the European Union's efforts in line with the Barcelona process in order to overcome such a bitter and profound crisis which calls on us to show political, economic and moral responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like everyone else, my group feels extremely frustrated and powerless at our not being able to do more to solve this bloody conflict that is the cause of so much suffering. In the last few days, we have been talking a lot about terrorism and, clearly, nothing would mean more in the fight against terrorism than peace in the Middle East. The situation there is the source of huge frustration and fanaticism, and it inculcates into young people a feeling of hopelessness and despair that creates a breeding ground for recruiting suicide bombers who are themselves also very young.</p>
<p class="contents">Two states – recognised by one another, democratic and existing side by side – would naturally have an enormously positive effect on stability throughout the region. Plans, projects, conferences and new initiatives – it feels as though we have tried everything. There is no lack of creativity when it comes to the Middle East. We need no more initiatives. We need political will, a desire really to sit down, negotiate and achieve peace. Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest that today’s leaders, whether in Israel or Palestine, have this will.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party condemns the murder of Sheik Yassin. It was contrary to international law. Assassination may appear logical from a military point of view, but it is the worst of diplomatic means. Yassin had odious crimes on his conscience. He has never recognised Israel’s right to exist. In all respects, he was a loathsome terrorist. Nonetheless, we cannot accept this type of killing. It must be possible to make higher demands of a democratic state such as Israel. Hamas has now been given a new martyr and thousands of people burning with the desire for revenge. The Palestinian leadership must therefore show unprecedented strength and leadership in order to prevent a new spiral of violence. Arafat must emphasise that it is not Hamas that is setting the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group cannot be too emphatic in its condemnation of the suicide bombers. This senseless killing of civilians, innocent children, women and men is paralysing the Israeli people and making the slightest errand or social excursion fraught with mortal danger. The fact that ever younger teenagers and children are now being recruited as suicide bombers is the most repellent form of terrorism of all and can never ever be explained or excused.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel and Palestine must return to the negotiating table and to the Quartet’s Road Map. I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for their work to bring this about.</p>
<p class="contents">We must obtain an end to the violence, and the Palestinian Authority must once and for all recognise Israel’s right to exist. For its part, Israel must stop building the Security Wall, which is condemned by the whole world. Walls can never be the solution. The previously promised and announced withdrawal from Gaza must also begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace in the Middle East and a peaceful Iraq in which I hope that the UN can be given a greater role would be very great progress and would have huge significance for the process of reform throughout the region. If, in the way that has been sketched out in the proposal now adopted, we succeed in incorporating these countries into a close and extensive network of trade and cooperation, it would constitute huge progress for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The collapse of the Arab League summit is tragic, but there is yet hope that reference will still be made to human rights and democracy, which are the places from which we have to begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I just want to raise another issue about which the ELDR Group feels uneasy, and that is the riots in Syria in which hundreds of Kurds have recently been killed. Many are imprisoned, and there are reports of members of this group being tortured following riots a week ago. I hope that the Council and the Commission can step up the pressure on Syria to put a stop to this killing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgantini (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> There is no doubt – and it is an obvious thing to say – that the conflicts in the Middle East are becoming more tragic by the day. I truly believe, and I am not just copying what others have said, that we must have the courage to admit that much of the responsibility for these unresolved conflicts lies with the international community and, most of all, with the military policy of President Bush and anyone who has stood up for that policy alongside President Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot evade this problem, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and with Commissioner Patten, that the Palestine-Israel question is central and essential to it. I also think we should abandon our conformist position and stop saying that the Palestinians do not recognise the State of Israel: they recognised it in 1988. It is not true that the Palestinian Authority does not want to negotiate: it is continually saying that it is prepared to negotiate. The one who is rejecting negotiation, the one who really is following a different policy is Ariel Sharon.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should assess the matter objectively. There is no doubt that the Palestinian Authority bears responsibility for its own inability to stop terrorist acts, but I also think we should clearly assess to what extent Ariel Sharon’s policy has brought on the growth in terrorism. Mr Patten is right: it does not mean that terrorist acts in themselves, irrespective of the policies that are being implemented, should be condemned and suppressed. Let us stop telling ourselves that they are all birds of a feather. There are differences, and these differences are the ban on and the failure to implement any international rights for the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now think about that great plan, rather than a working paper, that the United States has prepared for the G8 Summit in June. In fact it is an arrogant, imperialist project and, although it provides for the development of democracy, democratic processes, preambles, aid and support, it does so without any discussion with anybody. We cannot export democracy – apart from the fact that we should begin to think about our own democracies – since democracy is a continuous process in which we too are inadequate, in which we too sometimes have gaps and differences.</p>
<p class="contents">As it has been put forward, the Greater Middle East initiative is a plan that will certainly not help the growth of democracy. It will probably help some accomplice or subservient regimes, but it will not contribute to the reconstruction of Arab countries that do in fact need to free themselves from oppressive regimes and really need democracy. Not with arrogance and imperialism, however, please! I think the European Union’s decision to opt for the long term and not to aim for immediate results by cutting the Gordian knot of old is the right one. We therefore need time to reflect and to build relationships. In this sense, the Parliamentary Assembly organised in Athens is important: we have seen the differences and the diversity of the Arab world as well, and not just its weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to return for a moment to Ariel Sharon’s policy. In 1973, when Winston Churchill’s grandson asked him what was to become of the Palestinians, he answered that there was no need to worry: ‘We’ll make a pastrami sandwich of them.’ He would crush them in a sandwich. That is what he is doing by building the wall and preventing freedom of movement. Sheikh Yassin’s assassination was not the first: there have been 250 extrajudicial executions, and the first victim was Tabet Tabet, an Al Fatah pacifist who was working with Peace Now. Why, though, do we always have to keep repeating and reiterating these things?</p>
<p class="contents">I sometimes get tired of repeating myself and feeling that everyone bears the same responsibility. There are various types of responsibility, and I think that, with this decision, Ariel Sharon did not just kill a leader, something that – for heaven’s sake – I as a woman regard as the utmost in evil, but his intention was in fact to transform a national conflict into a religious conflict. That is what is so terrible. Four days ago I was in the mountains of Kurdistan and saw demonstrations in Van for Sheikh Yassin. That is the risk we are running; that is what President Bush has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also agree with the proposals put forward by Mr Barón Crespo on Article 2 and the other items. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why, as General Morillon said, are there, however, only words and pious wishes? Why not back our words with action? The EU has, of course, practical and unique opportunities to punish Israel through the Association Agreement. As early as May 2002, we considered, here in the European Parliament, that it was the last straw when it came to Israeli human rights violations, and we demanded then that the Association Agreement be suspended. Why does the Council not listen to Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Commission has expressed itself along the same lines as Parliament. At the most recent meeting of the Association Council, the Commission produced a long list of Israel’s infringements of human rights and of UN decisions. At that time, the Commission warned that the EU would subsequently have to review its position if there were no improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are concerned here with trade policy pure and simple. In a memo aimed at all importers of Israeli goods to the EU, the Commission has observed that Israel is being fraudulent in identifying the origin of its goods, so that goods from illegal Jewish settlements on occupied Palestinian land are being sent to the EU with ‘Israel’ stated on the certificate of origin. Fraud of this kind, involving the rules of the trade agreement, is on its own enough to justify suspending the Association Agreement. Why all these words? Why no action?</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we know that Israel has nuclear weapons and, according to the experts, probably still more weapons of mass destruction. Clearly, Israel is allowed to have them but, when others acquire them too, they are bombed back into the Stone Age. Why is action not taken against Israel?</p>
<p class="contents">How are we to have a peaceful world order, based upon law and justice, if tough punishment is meted out to certain lawbreakers – especially if they are Arab Muslims – while another lawbreaker, Israel, appears to be able to do whatever it likes, and all that occurs is that we repeat the same debate year after year after year without anything happening? The least that can be asked is that we repeal and suspend the Association Agreement, just as the European Parliament has requested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, I believe that the Middle East is gradually getting closer and is even right on our doorstep. We can see this in speeches with which, in some cases, I could not disagree more, such as Mrs Morgantini’s speech, but not just hers. Indeed, I believe that the terrorist attacks that we are witnessing within Europe must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot suddenly just consider the issue of the murder of Sheikh Yassin. As a Catholic, I reject any idea of one day hitting someone: not killing them, but just hitting them. In my opinion, this is not, however, the point. I believe that if we want to guarantee our citizens peace, tranquillity and serenity in the future, we need to draw up a very different proposal and follow very different lines of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, as such, cannot just be a mouthpiece for a message in terms of European funding for the Middle East area. Europe must put forward a genuine and specific proposal. I believe that this can be done, and in this case I appeal to Commissioner Patten and the Irish Council Presidency to call for an end to the conflicts. I believe that this could once again give politics a real voice and not just an issue on which to speculate in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">For those who, like me, have experienced terrorism – a different type of terrorism, ‘red terrorism’ – and have seen a bomb in the house and a brother get out through a window, political words meant nothing at the time, in the eighties. The answer that we found – as a young person at the time – was unique and truly incredible: there was a unity in purpose to achieve a single objective: to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this can only be done if we, as Europe, are aware of this and at the very least now compile a list of terrorist associations to be assessed at an international level. I believe that everything else is just idle chitchat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a matter of taking one of the two obvious, and old, sides in the Middle East conflict, with the Israelis on the one hand and the Palestinians on the other. This debate is outdated. The choice we must make concerns the current real divide, which pits the moderates against the extremists on both sides. The United States does not make this choice. It even does the exact opposite and sides with the moderates and extremists by turns. Furthermore, it very often sides with the extremists, whether they be the fundamentalist Muslims or Israeli religious extremists. It does this in accordance with the interest it has in dividing the region in order to rule it better.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Europe’s interest lies specifically in reuniting the region in order better to make a success of the forms of Mediterranean cooperation that will make the Mediterranean what it always was, that is to say the geopolitical centre of the world. France’s policy is the exact opposite of that of the United States. France resolutely sides with moderate Palestinians and Israelis on both sides. This is why, alone in the face of the United States, it is the other major power present in the Middle East. Alas, apart from France, Europe is too divided, so that we are reduced to the feeble words we have just heard from the Council. It is a shame, but it is not surprising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, in this Parliament, we have heard the party chairman Mr Barón Crespo authoritatively, and others I believe somewhat less authoritatively, remind us of the possibility of calling for Article 2 to be applied, that is to say the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel because of the death of Sheikh Yassin. His death is certainly a violation of international legality; there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council dedicated five paragraphs to condemning Israel for this, but I do not recall having read anything in the text about employing handicapped children for just a few euros to turn them into human bombs with 10 kg of explosives. We Radical Members have called for the suspension of the Association Agreements – as Commissioner Patten knows only too well – under Article 2, which unfortunately we have never, or almost never, put into practice, for scores of countries, many of them also in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important not to lose sight of this fact. If we consider it right to condemn Israel, a democratic country – having awarded it, so to speak, the title of democratic country – which means we can expect it to respect international law, assuming, on the other hand, that it is pointless to ask for respect, for example, from the other Arab countries, we are making a huge mistake and we are continuing to rant on without having an effective role in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of the Greater Middle East, for example, it is true that the Americans have been over-ingenuous, putting forward this proposal without allowing it to be scrutinised and assessed perhaps more attentively and being put first and foremost to the governments of the Middle East. The idea in itself is a good one – not the idea of exporting democracy, which just makes the concept appear ridiculous and trivial, rather like the one that we too tried to develop, to some extent artificially, long before the US proposal, with the infamous Sana’a Conference on Democracy and Human Rights in the Middle East. Either we lay the foundations for political democracy or, as Europe, we go along with the American idea, independently, of course, but put forward a strong proposal in the months to come, in consultation with Arab countries, taking an approach that seeks to involve them – not just at a governmental level but also at a civil society level – in a solid and strong proposal to promote the kind of societies and democracy called for by these countries in order to achieve development, as the UNDP told us.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, therefore, the way to resolve – or to include – the Israel-Palestine issue too in a more overall solution. To conclude, I applaud the fact that the major leaders of the European left finally recognise, as we have been saying for 30 years, that the accession of Israel and Palestine to the European Union is another important path towards reaching a lasting solution to the Middle East issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I do not think we should play the same narrow-minded game here at every sitting, raising again the supply of goods from the West Bank to the European Union. There is nothing wrong in discussing the matter, and last time we had a full debate about it. If those goods were supplied by the Palestinians, they would enjoy the same European Union preferences and it is therefore pointless to always encumber such a serious question as this conflict with such banalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, everyone in this Parliament condemns the illegal executions that Israel is carrying out. They are incompatible with international law and there is no need at all to discuss the matter. It is good that we as a European Union are making that absolutely clear. Many Americans are also saying that it is wrong. That is why we should not always be setting France against the USA in the matter. Henry Kissinger, too, said that quite clearly at the weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must do, however, is something that demands rather more: we must now engage in dialogue with the Arab world. It is of course far from reassuring that the Arab summit has recently been cancelled, that it cannot take place because it has been impossible to agree on a declaration containing the words democracy, parliament and civil society and speaking of women’s rights and democratic reform. We must also be clearer in reminding our partners south of the Mediterranean of our fundamental convictions if we want to reach a comprehensive solution. Those who are normally always very vociferous about these things in this House should also be vociferous in addressing the Arab world about them.</p>
<p class="contents">We do that with Israel. It is a democracy. We can expect a lot of it, and I believe we are right to do so. We should, however, develop a broader perspective on the Middle East. That also requires a dialogue with the Arab world about our fundamental principles. Otherwise, we will never find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The second report was published recently and goes into more depth as regards the lack of education and training, the severe limits in terms of cultural production, technology and research. The most revealing fact is that the team that is working on this project is made up entirely – and I repeat, entirely – of Arab researchers. The strategy for the Greater Middle East, drawn up by the Bush administration, is based largely on these analyses, with a limitation that I would say is fatal: that of prescribing changes and reforms without establishing any relationship with the Arab and Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the risk that this approach will fuel the notion that so-called Western civilisation thinks itself superior to all the religious and cultural traditions of the Arab world. This notion lies at the root of the feeling of humiliation that is so widespread in these countries and which terrorist groups exploit, hoping in turn to fuel hatred towards the West.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment that I would like to make concerns relations between the Bush administration and the Sharon government. In the eyes of the Arab world, the principle of double standards is intolerable. Can Sharon’s Israel still be defined as a country under the rule of law despite the extrajudicial executions, collective punishments, the construction of a wall in Palestinian territory, the settlements and the lack of access to fundamental resources such as water for the Palestinian people?</p>
<p class="contents">The US administration, so inflexible that it inflicted two wars on Iraq and ten years of embargo, today is not budging an inch on what was once again defined as a humanitarian disaster by the rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva yesterday. The concern is that the method chosen by the US administration and its indifference to the Middle East conflict could have the opposite effect, that is to say for it to seem, in the eyes of the public in these countries, that even greater credit is given to non-democratic governments and political classes that are responsible for the unfair use of resources, for widespread corruption, for the lack of democracy and fundamental freedoms <span class="bold">– </span>of women for a start – and in short those responsible for the crisis and the decline of these societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a role and a responsibility in all of this, but also a solid history of relations in the Mediterranean area, based on a different method, that of partnership. Recently this strategy was stepped up, as a response to enlargement to the East, with the neighbourhood policy. Today is therefore not about challenging all this, but rather about establishing a relationship with the Bush administration, with the Arab League and in collaboration with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), which makes Europe’s point of view heard as an alternative to the initiatives from the US Administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For Europe, the Mediterranean is a crucial area, an historic challenge and until it is transformed into an area of peace, development, democracy and stability, Europe will not, I am sorry to say, be able to fulfil its potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the conflict between Israel and Palestine is erasing any glimmer of hope and the worsening of the conflict is certainly not helping to combat international terrorism, indeed in ideological terms it is fuelling it. In order to ensure a future of peace in this area, however, greater responsibility is needed and all our efforts, our political authority and our financial and human resources must be used to ensure that we get back on the road to negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Athens Forum was therefore an important step, but this is not about supporting one side or the other. The route that we must take, even now that hopes for peace seem almost dead, remains that of working towards a clear objective: two states, one alongside the other, Israel and Palestine, that live in peace and security without discrimination and with respect for human rights.

Having participated in the establishment and development of Hamas with, at the time, the intention of weakening the PLO, the Israeli powers today seek to torpedo any idea of a peaceful solution. This brute-force approach has but one aim: that of destroying any hope of a negotiated peace with, as a consequence, the construction of the Wall imposed as the only acceptable solution. This shameful wall imprisons an entire nation, goes on annexing its land and resources and is overwhelmingly condemned by world opinion, as witnessed to by the debates of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this policy that is suicidal for both the Palestinians and the Israelis, the call by sixty key Palestinian figures to refrain from avenging the death of the Hamas leader is extremely dignified and courageous. It is high time the European Union supported them by clearly identifying Sharon as the main obstacle to peace; by specifically entering into official talks with those opposed to this policy of adopting the worst possible line, notably the pioneers of the Geneva Accord; by officially requesting the immediate deployment of an international force to protect the population of the Palestinian territories; and by suspending the agreement with Israel, as demanded by our Parliament two years ago. In short, by matching words with action in the interests of respect for international law. Any other approach is bound to fail and cannot be taken seriously under any circumstances, especially by Arab countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While the American president continues to encourage Sharon, welcoming him in a few days’ time, the Union can no longer hide behind words. In a totally different spirit to the American plans for a Greater Middle East serving only their economic and strategic interests, Europe must finally take action if it wants to realise the ambition declared in Barcelona of bringing about a region of peace and prosperity. The proven lies concerning the reasons for armed intervention in Iraq and the new boost given to terrorism extending also into Europe drive us to take initiatives much bolder than those implied by what the Council and the Commission have told us today. An end to the occupation and the recognition of a sovereign and viable Palestinian State would also deprive the terrorists of a fertile breeding ground.

Unfortunately, Sharon does not even remotely live up to this respect. It is detrimental to every peace effort that the international community is <span class="italic">de facto</span> allowing Sharon constantly to violate international rules. To condemn Israel is not enough: measures need to be taken. The EU could begin by suspending the trade agreements. Clearly Israel is entitled to protect its citizens against terror attacks, but Sharon's persisting violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, are not protecting but endangering its citizens. It is contrary to international law; it totally undermines the very concept of the rule of law, which is a key element in the fight against terrorism. Israel could easily arrest suspected terrorists, instead of killing innocent passers-by, of whom many are women and children, using exactly the same despicable means as suicide bombers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Authority cannot stop suicide bombings when Israel deliberately fuels everything that leads to them, thus sharing the responsibility for them. In many cases, Israel has used extrajudicial killings against exactly those Palestinian leaders who have been strong advocates for peace and for stopping the suicide bombings.

The Middle East is a source of vital oil supplies to the West and the location of one of the longest and bloodiest disputes between the Arab world and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the location of some of the most ruthless regimes, ranging from the old Iraq of Saddam to the current government of Iran. Saudi Arabia is also brutal in its decapitations for misdemeanours, like alcohol consumption. The Middle East is a source of many of the EU's refugees, particularly from Kurdistan, and if we allow Turkey into the EU, the EU's borders will stretch into the Middle East to face Syria, Iraq and Iran directly. Therefore stabilising this region in peace, democracy, good governance with the rule of law and respect for human rights is essential to the EU's interest, as well as the people there who have suffered under tyrannical governments for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I support the roadmap for peace, for a two-state solution in Israel and in Palestine, for a democratic Palestine alongside the State of Israel. But I remain critical of the fact that EU money was given in direct budgetary assistance without adequate safeguards to prevent diversion of funds to corrupt practice and possibly even terrorism in a theatre of war and in a zone where such practice is commonplace: this, I believe, was wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, Parliament's working group looking at this will regrettably be publishing two separate reports. I have always supported and continue to support the liberation of Iraq from Ba'athist tyranny and remain optimistic that eventually we will see a new Iraq emerge which will serve as a catalyst for democratic change elsewhere in the region. Lastly, I hope to see more dialogue between moderate Muslim leaders and the EU's political classes if we are to avoid the much feared clash of civilisations as a scenario. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion – I would insist – these circumstances, together with the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, have led to the suspension of the new Arab Summit, scheduled for yesterday in Tunisia, and I believe that no possible initiative for a so-called ‘Greater Middle East’ can succeed in any way in this context. We simply have to look at what King Abdullah of Jordan, who we all know to be a clearly moderate leader, said the day before yesterday – and I quote, ‘the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, a week before the Arab League Summit, demonstrates that the Israelis wanted the meeting to fail and for the Arabs not to be able to relaunch their dialogue initiative, because Israel does not want peace’. If a moderate leader says what I have just quoted, the Union must take note of what this implies and take action as a consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying to Mr Laschet, who has just spoken – although I regret that he is not here – that I agree with him when he says that we must talk less about the extra-judicial assassinations violating international law, because we all condemn them. The problem is that these assassinations take place, we all condemn them, but none of us act to put an end to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, the American plan deserves some consideration since it invites us to move beyond the illusion in which European action is currently mired, the illusion whereby resolution of the conflict would precede the democratisation of the Middle East.

The Union bears a historic and political responsibility, and it can no longer content itself only with issuing condemnations when the region is ablaze or weeping when terrorism strikes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the United States tells us that it has a plan for the Middle East. How, though, can we talk in terms of plans when we know that Syria has a presence in Lebanon, when the occupation in Iraq is ongoing and when a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has still not been found? This plan is, indeed, disputed and disputable. It is disputed because the United States has not bothered to discuss it with the countries concerned. This clearly reveals America’s mistrust and their unilateral practices, just as the pre-emptive war in Iraq did. It also reflects the geopolitical ignorance of the United States and the generalisations it makes by including Maghreb in the Middle East, and Pakistan and Afghanistan among the Arab countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what does this plan advocate? The fight against terrorism? Yes, but with the installation of American bases in the region. Has not this been the case since 1990-1991? Resolution of the conflict? Yes, but to be credible, it would be necessary to fight all forms of terrorism, including the state terrorism conducted by Israel, which is doggedly trying to exterminate the Palestinian people, yet with total impunity. Lastly, democratic reforms? Certainly, yes, they are inevitable and essential, because the people are today suffering an economic, political and democratic deficit. These reforms are needed, but so is economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in conclusion, only by reducing the gap between the ruling classes and the people will these reforms be possible. Civil society must be involved. It is for this reason that we in Europe must support the forces of progress or internal forces for peace and strengthen dialogue in order to dispel fears, to finally put an end to this violence and to let our common values govern us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since the Palestinian leadership started the second <span class="italic">Intifada</span>, two and a half years ago, in order to achieve their goals by violent means, nearly one thousand Israeli men, women and children have been killed by poisoned minds with shrapnel grenades around their waists. Where is the Europe-wide indignation about the Palestinian leaders, who drape bombs around their children and, if they are detained by soldiers, are prepared to blow them up in cold blood?</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East is the Palestinians' unwillingness to recognise the State of Israel. There is no other explanation for Arafat's refusal at Camp David. The State of Israel accounts for only 0.6% of Arab territory. For a long time, Arab nations thought they could drive the Jews into the sea by using the Palestinian refugees as a means of putting Israel under international pressure. The Arab countries have never allowed their Palestinian brothers to lead a dignified existence. The UN, too, kept the refugee status of the Palestinians artificially in place for 50 years. King Abdullah's first reaction to a possible retreat of Israel from the Gaza was the fear that Palestinians would be looking for jobs in Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace is inextricably linked with justice, and that is where the problem lies. On its own continent, Europe has placed democracy on a pedestal, but ignores democracy in Israel, in a region which consists of nothing but dictatorships – enlightened or not, as the case may be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a tragedy because the summit was to have considered a number of proposals for reform in the Arab region. I want to focus on this question of reform because that is fundamental to our security in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Foreign Minister spoke about the Arab-Israeli conflict. He also spoke about the evolution of democracy and civil society in these lands. My question is, what can <span class="italic">we</span> do?

<p class="contents">As some of you may know, I have spent some time in the last few months, as rapporteur on the democracy initiative, going to the conference in Sana'a, Yemen, to Cairo, Alexandria, Damascus, to the Arab Parliamentary Union conference and to Athens last week with you, Mr President. This sort of democratic odyssey is trying to establish one thing: the appetite of the peoples of the Arab countries for democracy, the rule of law, civil society and so on. We know what our foreign policy priority is: we know it is human rights, it is democracy, the promotion of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. But in this arc of instability on our rim, while the EU is spending EUR 700 million plus in MEDA funds, only EUR 7 million of that is being spent on democracy. I find myself caught between the Scylla of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Council and the Charybdis of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Commission. We need a programme that works: we have the means to do it and we have the will to do it in this Parliament. The question is, do the Commission and Council accept their political priorities?

I call on the Palestinians not to use violence to avenge Sharon’s illegal act. Now is the time to break the cycle and opt for peaceful resistance in a dignified manner. I would echo the appeal by a group of Palestinian academics not to commit any new suicide attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Sharon violates human rights, ignores UN resolutions by building a wall in the Occupied Territories, by building new settlements and by the extrajudicial executions of Palestinians. I would therefore call for a suspension of the EU's association agreement with Israel in accordance with Article 2, the human rights clause, until such time as the Israeli Government has withdrawn its call for attacks, which are in contravention of international law, and mean that the Sharon Government constitutes a threat to safety and to the constitutional state of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli-Palestinian situation is a seriously disturbing factor in the entire region. What the Middle East needs is a broad democratic initiative for dialogue and cooperation between all countries in it, and Europe possesses the appropriate instruments to bring one about. We must organise the partnerships between the EU and the Mediterranean countries in the framework of the Barcelona process, in which we strategically promote political and economic, but also social, reforms, in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am convinced that there is a great political need for this among the citizens of both Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would call on the EU Member States in the UN Security Council to submit a proposal for a UN intervention force based on the boundaries of 1967, in a bid to protect the Israeli and Palestinian citizens against terrorist attacks. Working for peace in the Middle East is a huge contribution in the fight against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The women were from 22 different Arab countries. What struck me was that they all speak a common language, which gave them a unity that perhaps we still aspire to here in Europe. Regardless of what they spoke about at that conference – and they were all highly educated, sophisticated women – the issue of Palestine was mentioned by every single person. Clearly, this issue is a hugely unifying factor throughout all the Arab countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Ireland have learned – tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period – what it is to live with terrorism. We have also seen some of the bitterest enemies in the world take a leap of faith that led to peace in Northern Ireland – to the great relief of all of us. Commissioner Patten clearly had a part in that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to repeat many of the things colleagues have said here this afternoon, but we have to recognise that at the heart of the tragedy is another generation of little people living in those squalid camps in Palestine who are growing up, and the first game they play is throwing stones at soldiers – just as they did in Northern Ireland. There is also another generation of children on the other side of the border who are too terrified to go to school in case the bus they are riding in is blown up. These are the children who 20 years from now will be the leaders, or perhaps the victims, or the suicide bombers.</p>
<p class="contents">We all condemn unreservedly the dreadful events in both Palestine and Israel. But there has to be that leap of faith, that moment in which, as a friend of mine said, we have to smile weakly and have a strong stomach and forget about the awful things we have done to each other and start to try and address the dreadful issues in the Middle East which are central to practically every single major political issue in the world today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it is not all going to be hot air, then in my opinion two things in particular must remain at the heart of such a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, resolution of the main conflict in the Middle East. I wish the US would devote as much energy – by which I do not mean military manpower – to solving the actual Middle East problem as it is doing to Iraq. I would also like Europe to expend as much energy solving the Middle East problem as some European Union Member States are doing in the case of Iraq, because there would then be fewer terrorist attacks and there would be fewer illegal killings like that of Sheikh Yassin. As Commissioner Patten said, the culture of death must be defeated and destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, yes, the Arab world does indeed need reforms. Unlike many of my fellow Members here, however, I have not seen much evidence of the Americans supporting the reform movements in Jordan, Egypt or Saudi Arabia in recent years. I have not noticed them supporting democracy and human rights in those countries very much. If the United States of America is now taking up that cause, I am very much in favour of joining them in supporting the reform efforts inside the Arab countries. There are enough women who are dissatisfied with the continuing severe discrimination against women. There are enough minorities who are dissatisfied with the discrimination against minorities. There are enough people in the Arab countries who are dissatisfied with discrimination and disregard for human rights and the rights of minorities. Not long ago, we welcomed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy people who had recently written a report showing where the obstacles lie, obstacles to modernisation and democratisation recognised by the Arab countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the only practical way forward for a new Middle East policy is not to threaten outside military intervention but for Europe, in particular, to support the reform forces in the Arab countries. We should be doing more, spending more money and of course also using much more energy to drive those important reforms in the Arab countries forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, if he looked into it further, he would say that we have a greater tragedy. Where is the balance? The balance is quite clearly worse today than it was ten years ago when there were events and political choices.</p>
<p class="contents">When it became clear from various quarters that the official government line was to murder people, we did not react. When the new wall of shame started to be built, again we did not react. A particular peculiarity distinguishes the shape of our policy. Yes! We are the biggest financiers of the area, but to finance someone without intervening politically is basically like pouring water into a pitcher full of holes, into a bucket full of holes, which cannot hold the water.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing now? Quite clearly we have to take initiatives. In a few days, as is our custom, the presiding country will meet the president of the United States of America in order to raise the imperative question of the joint approach to this issue. It would, of course, be better if this meeting were held in Brussels at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also talking about the Euro-Mediterranean conference and we all welcome the meeting in Athens at parliamentary level. However, there must also be a corresponding initiative at government level. In other words, if we cannot get to the heart of the problem, we must confine the problem. It would not be a bad thing, for example, if we set up a special office in the area, based in Cyprus, to take account of all the irritations and take the corresponding initiatives. Politics are not neutral. Politics mean initiative, pro-action, proposals and results. If the European Union wants to demonstrate its ability, including for its own interests, it is an area which has matured to the point at which it will have the general acceptance of mankind if it makes a positive contribution to resolving the Palestinian problem, which is the tip of a broader problem, but if the tip is solved, it will also be resolved at the base. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I totally condemn all terrorism, whatever its source, and I also call on Palestinians not to respond violently to this most recent provocation. If we are to begin to bring an end to this spiral of violence, then someone has to take the first leap. I abhor in particular the use of children as proxy bombers and the targeting of civilians by Palestinian terror groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Ariel Sharon has once again adopted bully-boy tactics which can only block the peace process and obstruct any chance for constructive negotiations. The continuing occupation of Palestinian territory and the construction of the so-called security wall, mostly on Palestinian territory, is ghettoising Palestinians, destroying their livelihoods, imprisoning and impoverishing them and driving them to despair. The European Union, on the other hand, has all carrot and no stick. It is not that the European Union does not have a stick, it simply refuses to even wave the stick, never mind use it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on the Commission and the Council to demand that Israel take immediate steps to comply with the human rights obligations it entered into in the association agreement. It is not doing so and unless we take action to insist that they do, we will reap a terrible harvest in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Cyprus joins on 1 May, Tel Aviv will be half an hour's flight away from the European Union, and we will be direct neighbours. During the recent visit by Parliament's delegation, we noticed that many Israelis have high expectations of the European Union. They are expecting us to take a leading role in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel is being ruled by a man who rides roughshod over international law and who, in the present conflict, continues to pour oil upon the flames. He is doing a great deal of damage to his country and gives international terrorists an excellent excuse for their actions.</p>

I should like to thank the Members who have participated. This has been a useful discussion, and it has also made clear that there exists a fundamental consensus amongst us on the need for the European Union to exert maximum effort on the issues that have been raised. We all agree that the European Union needs to raise the level of its engagement within the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree particularly with Members as to the importance of intensive consultation with the countries involved in the region. The drive and the initiative to address these challenges and to implement the necessary reforms must come from the region itself. It is easy to be in despair when you see, as we have seen, horror heaped on horror, misery on top of misery. However, the reality is that the Union must be involved in pushing forward where it can to try and create at least a space in which peace can be created.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must work in partnership with the region to this end, to help to meet all of these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">A lasting and comprehensive settlement is set out in the roadmap, and the roadmap is the only way forward. It was mentioned that the suspension of the Association Agreement is a way forward in the region. I think that discussion and pressure would produce some progress. In the interim report on the strategic partnership endorsed by the Council last week, the European Union has established a set of guiding principles for its engagement in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency is committed to developing the strategic partnership on the basis of partnership and dialogue with all the countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like to thank Members for their thoughtful and incisive contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It comes in the wake of a cluster of similar murders, which some people are justifying in the name of protection from terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sharon government would not dare to commit crimes if it did not have direct support and encouragement from the USA. For its part, the ΕU is continuing its policy of tolerance and support for Israel which puts the slaughterers and the slaughtered on an equal footing. The summit in Brussels confined itself to expressing its opposition to ‘extra-judicial killings’ (as it calls the murders), but recognised ‘Israel’s right to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly expressed its solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and its support for its just fight and its absolute condemnation of Israel's policy of genocide, its regret at the loss of life and its conviction that the source of all the violence is the occupation of the Palestinian territories. It also expresses its support for the pacifist forces in Israel and for all those who refuse to serve in the army and the occupied territories.

A joint initiative for peace, stability and democracy throughout the Middle East, in the words of the title of this Council and Commission declaration, would be worthy of our support if it were indeed a joint initiative for peace.

<p class="contents">Parliament and the European Union must adopt clear and unequivocal positions to condemn terrorism, but such positions will only have credibility when they condemn the terrorist policies of the Israeli Government and when those positions lead to concrete political and diplomatic measures, such as suspending the association agreement with Israel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
