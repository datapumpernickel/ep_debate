<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. − </span>Madam President, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to present to this House the Commission’s work programme for 2013, which has just been adopted by the College, which is still in session, because this programme is the culmination of an intense political dialogue and very close collaboration between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We had very good collaboration with the Conference of Committee Chairs. The structural dialogue between the Commission and the sectoral committees was much deeper than last year and the debate after the State of the Union address, the recent exchange of views between the Commission and the Conference of Committee Chairs, and the exchange between the Conference of Presidents and myself have all been information sources which contributed to the preparation of the Commission’s work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It was quite clear from all these discussions that this programme has to focus on how the EU can best contribute to what is our most pressing priority: reviving growth and creating jobs. 2013 will indeed be a decisive year in turning Europe round to face up to the crisis and to pursue the path of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. As we listened to the exchanges this morning, we could all conclude that there is no one silver bullet, and that all levels of society must contribute. But we are at EU level and we have to look at how the EU level can help to show a lead and make sure the result of our action will be a strong record to put before the electorate in 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission’s priorities are clustered around seven key policy areas. The first covers moving towards a genuine EMU. Here it is quite clear that a deep and genuine economic union must be based on political, and hence more democratic, union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is boosting competitiveness through the single market and industrial policy. The third is building fully integrated networks in telecoms, energy and transport as a prerequisite for competitiveness, jobs and growth. The fourth is growth for jobs: supporting employment services, promoting social inclusion and entry into labour markets, with special measures to help vulnerable groups, notably young people who are faced with a huge unemployment pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth is using Europe’s resources to compete better. The sixth priority is to provide greater safety and security to all EU citizens and the seventh – last, but not least – strengthening the EU as a global actor, notably to unleash all our potential in trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For each of these seven key policy areas, the work programme sets out clearly the long-term vision and objectives, summarises what is missing and explains how the Commission will take up the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, let me briefly take you through some of the main priorities. The details of building a genuine economic and monetary union are the subject of a deep reflection. As this morning’s debate showed, the discussion will continue but the Commission will present shortly its blueprint, which should be a contribution to this debate. It will show how to have an ambitious approach, based on existing institutions to ensure full democratic control. Making this happen will be the key priority for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means modernising the ways that we generate public revenue – at European and at national level. The Commission has responded today to the request from those Member States who wish to move ahead quickly on a Financial Transaction Tax. Large and small Member States determined to pioneer a new way to make everybody shoulder their fair share.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore continue to push for a strong and competitive financial sector to restore growth and investment in the real economy. I see, for instance, that good progress is already being made on the credit rating agencies file in Parliament and in the Council. In 2013, we will address shadow banking, and put key indices used in the financial sector on a stronger footing. Businesses and home owners cannot be open to manipulation of the interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are not starting from scratch. The legislation this House has passed has already transformed the financial sector to a great extent. The European Semester is now established as a key pillar of economic governance. But to restore the confidence of citizens and markets we must go further and together.</p>
<p class="contents">If stability is the basis for sustainable growth and jobs, competitiveness and confidence are the engines. Europe’s economy can only survive with a strong and modern industrial base and our companies can only win away if the home field provides an optimal platform.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need a strong single market. We need to fill regulatory gaps. We need to unleash the growth potential in networks and the digital economy. We need to exploit mobility and we need to use cohesion policy as a driver for reform, not just as the safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have seen the ideas put forward by the Commission in its Industrial Policy Flagship and Single Market Acts. Building on the progress made in the first phase, we should all pull together to make sure that these actions are developed, agreed and implemented before June 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement on the package for the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 is critical. It offers the kind of smart investment the EU economy needs and, subject to an agreement being found, we will need to devote a lot of attention and effort next year to the finalisation of sectoral instruments and programming of the next generation of projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The next year will also see new initiatives in key areas: on access to finance, in particular for SMEs; on cutting costs in areas like VAT; on leveraging investment in strategic sectors from aeronautics to pharmaceuticals; on broadband infrastructure and electronic payments. We also need to give investors long-term certainty and long-term vision about the society they live in.</p>
<p class="contents">Modernising infrastructure in ICT, energy and transport is critical to providing this certainty. So too is a fresh look at European air and waste legislation. This is, in particular, why we need a framework for climate and energy policy to 2030.</p>
<p class="contents">To build the future, Europe must build on its youth. Youth unemployment is a crisis within the crisis. The human tragedy and the economic loss of leaving a generation on the sidelines is something that we can neither allow, nor afford as a society. While many of the levers are national, there is much that Europe can do to invest in its people, to increase mobility between jobs and across borders, to target education and training in the right skills, and to protect the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Semester is proving a key tool to stimulate job creation and to bring closer a truly European labour market. Amongst new proposals will be very practical measures to network national employment services to work together. I hope also that the proposals we are preparing for December of this year on employment packages, especially on youth guarantee, will be one of the priorities for this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a community of values. At a time when our attention is directed at the economy, we must not lose sight of this: our freedoms sustain our prosperity. To grow and create jobs we must continue to safeguard and expand the freedoms of citizens. The EU must also protect its citizens by adapting to new threats and challenges. Concrete action next year to fight arms traffic, improve judicial cooperation and protect financial interests through a European Public Prosecutor will all help to ensure that citizens and companies can exercise their freedoms and rights in security.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2013, the Commission will also continue relentlessly to defend European values and interests around the world. In external trade this can make a huge difference, with the potential for 2 million new jobs in the medium term. Possible agreements with partners such as Japan and the United States would have a huge impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must continue to show that it is a positive force worldwide. This was very clearly recognised by the Nobel Prize Committee. Effective development and humanitarian aid will be directed to those most in need and an active enlargement and neighbourhood policy will continue to make the EU an anchor of peaceful development in our region and beyond. Once again, putting the new generation of programmes in place will make a key contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, honourable Members, these are crucial years for Europe. The steps we take over the next few years will decide our future path. We must direct our energies to making the most of the rest of this legislature, bringing all key proposals to their conclusion before 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is looking forward to working closely with Parliament and the Member States to move from programme to progress and to take the next decisive concrete steps together towards a stronger, more prosperous and fairer Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Parliament, in the different committees and also in plenary, has been dealing with this for quite a long time. We have not seen the new text, so we can only learn from what the Vice-President of the Commission says, but I would like to welcome the readiness on the part of the Commission to take on board some of the elements which were discussed here in Parliament just a month ago and which were included in our resolution in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously at this time of crisis we have to be more aware of programming, but I would also like to stress – as we stressed in the resolution – that the Commission and Parliament have to be flexible and react quickly to the difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to enumerate some of the points which our group, the European People’s Party, take as a condition for the support of the Commission work programme. Obviously we give our support when the Commission plays its full role in defending the Community method. We encourage and would like to see better use of delegated acts, which is a clear distinction in the new Lisbon Treaty. This must help our controlling role over the Commission’s work and, obviously, the work of the other institutions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the Commission when it is ready to further reduce the regulatory burden or to identify the regulatory areas which are really important from the point of view of the crisis. Obviously we cannot say in general that we should deregulate everything. There are areas which the crisis has shown need more regulation, but the regulatory burden as such should be reduced. We also support the Commission when it is ready to improve the implementation and the rate and timing of EU legislation. If we are making laws here in Parliament, it is in vain if the Member States or the application of that legislation is not affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to support the political ambition and vision of the European Union in the global world, especially in the light of what President Barroso said at the September part-session in his speech on the state of the Union. Obviously we, as Members of Parliament who are directly elected, are accountable for the European Union’s action and lack of action, so we rightly demand added value. We are also ready to respond quickly to different situations and to use the fast-track procedure whenever it is needed for the good of European citizens. But we are also responsible for checking and controlling the Commission and other European institutions with regard to the efficient use of taxpayers’ money. We would also like to support the line of the Commission in the area of cohesion policy. You mentioned youth unemployment, which was also part of our discussion last time, and also the employability of elderly people and supporting mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to underline and stress – as the Vice-President has stressed – the creation of the necessary measures in order to strengthen the European industrial base. This is a very important point for our party, as is the full implementation of the internal market with a binding calendar.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point stems from this: when we are doing something – and the Commission work programme should be exactly about that – showing a roadmap and a binding calendar of how we are going to proceed the next year – it should be with flexibility and reactivity, because our responsibility does not stop at fulfilling pre-designed patterns but also extends to creating an innovative reaction to the different elements and events of the crisis. I would like to express, with these conditions, support for the Commission work programme on behalf of the European People’s Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has also told us that the reform agenda will work only if it is fair and equitable, because inequality is unsustainable. Finally, he has stated that Europe’s global competitiveness will depend on its social model. I believe that this is a sound assessment of the situation and that the intentions are correct, but they are nothing more than fine words, because between Mr Barroso’s statements and the Commission’s work programme there is a virtually unbridgeable gulf. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at how the 2012 work programme has turned out. More than half of the Commission’s programme has not been implemented. Work has yet to be completed in areas such as renewal of the strategy on health and safety, workers’ rights, the right to bodily integrity and workers’ freedom of movement. All of this affects the lives of EU citizens, as does the Tobacco Directive, a revised version of which we hope to see before this Parliament very soon. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore failed on 2012, and yet it disappoints with regard to 2013. Where are the measures aimed at tackling youth unemployment? What can we expect from the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion? Where are the commitments on social dialogue?</p>
<p class="contents">Youth unemployment in Europe lies above 20 % and, in many countries, is higher than 50 %. The ‘Youth Guarantee’ is to be welcomed, but it requires a strategy that is more aggressive and better coordinated. </p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem with the work programme, however, is its failure to address social and employment questions. The Treaties call for the promotion of employment and guarantees relating to citizens’ lives to be coordinated with social protection and economic considerations, but the Commission has opted for an inflexible strategy of price stability and fiscal discipline, a strategy that is not working and is, moreover, self-defeating. </p>
<p class="contents">If our experience teaches us anything, it is that monetary union is unsustainable without economic and social union. That is why we, like the Vice-President, are calling for this broader social governance to be included as part of the European Semester, for the European Semester to incorporate a more inclusive vision and social investment that ties in with the Europe 2020 goals. We need to realise that economic and monetary union is not an end in itself, but an instrument for ensuring the welfare of citizens; we therefore require a youth guarantee, a social protocol guaranteeing social rights and an active employment policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we count on the Commission’s support in upholding the Union method and in order to prevent reforms that will undermine the position of the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">With my last point, I would like to stress the need for the European Union to undertake to ensure the distribution of food to the millions of EU citizens living in poverty, who are the responsibility of the European Union and not just of the Member State governments or national authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was not clear whether such building blocks would include a draft proposal for a redemption fund, and I would be very grateful for Commissioner Šefčovič to clarify this. It will be extremely problematic for Parliament to agree on the ‘two-pack’ in the absence of progress on the redemption fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following the unfortunate disappearance of former Commissioner Dalli, what is the fate of the Tobacco Products Directive? This is an issue of great interest to Parliament and Mr Šefčovič is in command of the portfolio of former Commissioner Dalli at present and might be able to tell us this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is of course splendid that we are having more plans for lawmaking in the single market area, but we have to appreciate that the present package of single market law is still far from complete. The Services Directive, which is a key element in this, is not properly in force yet in several Member States. The Patents Directive is still out there craving for a solution and the ALDE Group would wish to emphasise the importance of completing current programmes of implementing the law that we have worked on and ought to be in force before we can see our way clearly to the final sunny uplands of a single market that will appear to be more complete. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This unexpected affair is intriguing and has left me somewhat bewildered. There is something fishy about this alleged story of corruption and we have the right to find out all the details. Of course, Commissioners must not be above the law. They must answer for themselves like any other citizen. However, nor must Commissioners must be beneath the law and I have the feeling that John Dalli is being deprived of basic rights and, in particular, the presumption of innocence while there is no concrete and direct proof of his guilt.</p>
<p class="contents">Several questions come to mind, therefore, and I would like the Commission to give us some insight into this affair. What legal provision, what regulation or what Treaty has Mr Dalli infringed with his behaviour? What is the Commission’s view of his alleged guilt? Is it not possible that this affair might be a manoeuvre to derail the Tobacco Products Directive?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would ask you to give us some details about this extraordinary situation and I call on OLAF to send us its report as soon as possible</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I read Mr Barroso’s letter assuring us that the Tobacco Products Directive would not be postponed. However, we would like more information about the timetable, which is already more than a year behind. This long-awaited Directive is ready and I would ask the Commission to make every effort to implement it. Are we going to have to wait until Tonio Borg takes up his post? We believe that this is extremely urgent from a health perspective and that the Directive should therefore get back on track, because if we do not do it now, it will have to wait until the next parliamentary term. Who will win in that case? The tobacco lobby! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is nothing particularly unexpected in them, but I want to make a broader point, if I may, about presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say to Mr Šefčovič that this is not actually the Commission’s work programme at all. This is a list of new initiatives. But, as a number of my colleagues have pointed out, the continuing work on projects started during 2012 – and even earlier – which have yet to be completed is as important as the new initiatives. Also, a really important part of the Commission’s work – and here I support what a number of colleagues have said already – is actually the implementation and enforcement of existing regulations and directives.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the area with which I am most familiar, we will complete next year, I am sure, a major review of the public procurement directives. That will require an intensive transposition and training programme across Member States to make it really effective. I would say to Commissioner Šefčovič, that in future his work programme has to be the whole work programme. We do not just want to see the new initiatives; we also want to see the progress which is going on in those areas, because that is a crucial part of your role in the Commission. We want to see that programmed, we want to see what you are doing and we want to be engaged with that.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Andrew Duff, mentioned the Services Directive, which my committee has been working on extremely actively. This brings me to the second thing which is completely absent from the programme. Here at the back we have a list of your ideas about the proposals which are simplifying regulation, but I want to remind you that in our resolution on the work programme – which you commented on – we specifically asked the Commission to improve the quality of its legislative drafting and also to deal with the concerns we have about the qualitative impact assessment procedure and how well that is working. There is nothing about this in here at all. Why not? We know that the Secretary-General of the Commission is working on a review of that, which is not mentioned in here either.</p>
<p class="contents">So do better next time, please. Send us a proper work programme: initiatives, continuity, quality, implementation. Let us make this work properly, Mr Šefčovič; let us not have a partial programme, and please also stop dressing up these ideas with new little sub-initiatives. Let us get down to the real meat of doing our job better together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look forward to making a constructive and positive input on the proposals, which have the potential to benefit the people of Europe. Taken as a whole, however, the work programme is, we believe, another missed opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to come up with a radically new approach. There is no mention at all of the tobacco directive, which is already long overdue. The work programme needs to put people’s needs before profits, and it needs to recognise that the austerity measures are particularly detrimental to women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Child poverty has increased as a result of the austerity measures. I listened intently to what you had to say about growth and jobs. Despite the upbeat rhetoric, measures to invest in jobs and growth are half-hearted and under-funded, and are rendered somewhat ineffective by the ideological attachment to the policies of austerity. Already we have 25 million people unemployed across Europe, and that number is growing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is disappointing that the work programme does not address at all the failed policies of chasing after Third World conditions in employment and public services. We will not get out of this crisis by lowering wages and destroying jobs and public services, cutting spending and pouring billions of pounds into the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the September State of the Union address by President Barroso, I said that he needed to give his head a shake. I respectfully suggest, Mr Vice-President, that you need to do the same, and get a better understanding of the damage that has been caused to peoples’ lives by the severe austerity measures that are being run through the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, 2013 will also see the transition to the third phase of the European Union’s emissions trading system. In this regard, the Commission is fighting for ever greater powers to interfere in national politics and with the competitiveness of individual economies. Neither Parliament nor the Member State governments should agree to this. The proposal for a decision on the timing of auctions of CO<span class="sub">2</span> allowances is just one of the actions put forward by the Commission that could plunge national economies even further into crisis, in particular countries such as Poland, whose industry is dependent on coal. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am hopeful that the Commission’s work programme for the next year will also include my compatriots’ proposal, registered as one of the first citizens’ initiatives, to suspend the climate and energy package that is so damaging to our part of Europe.

Indeed, the austerity programme is calculated to produce unemployment and not to combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">One policy area mentioned is genuine economic and monetary union: the euro, with its common external value that is hideously overvalued for the countries of the South, and which is aggravating and perpetuating the recession for them. Another Commission priority is said to be to use EU resources to improve competitiveness. Well, countries with overvalued currencies cannot compete even with other countries in their region. The EU’s embrace of globalism means that European manufacturers have to compete with emergent economies with pirated designs, workers on artificially depressed wages and slave-labour conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. − </span>Madam President, I will try to react to the comments made in the interventions by the honourable Members concerning the Commission’s work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very sorry that I was not able to deliver the text of the Commission’s work programme because it was approved just one-and-a-half hours ago. We had wanted to present it to the House immediately. However, now it has been adopted, I am sure that it will be available very soon, today.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the relationship between delegated and implementing acts, we have been working together with Mr Szájer on a common understanding on how to use delegated acts and how to use implementing acts. We both agree that the source of our proposals, whether we propose delegated or implementing acts, should be the Treaty, because it is very clear on what kind of policies you need delegated acts for and for what kind of policies you need implementing acts.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a topic we discussed at great length with the Conference of Presidents and with the Conference of Committee Chairs. What we agreed was that we need to coordinate much better in our legislative process, and much earlier on, because what happens sometimes is that the delegated versus implementing act issue becomes a bargaining chip at the end of negotiations, which is not correct. Very often this makes things legally unsound, and the Commission has very often had to approach the European Court of Justice to reverse some of the decisions which have been adopted in the legislative process following the choice in our review of the wrong legal instrument for a particular legislative proposal. A suggestion would be to cooperate closer early on, to respect the Treaty and not to use delegated or implementing acts as a bargaining chip at the end of the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the regulatory burden, here we have absolutely the same view, which is that we need to reduce it. The Commission has already put on the legislative table proposals for reducing the administrative burden by more than 31 %. It is now our common task – and the Commission will take this very seriously – to see how this possibility is actually being used at Member State level. We are working together very intensely, but we do not always see all the simplifications we have introduced at European level trickle down to the national level. We have to continue to work on this together, so that the real reduction of the administrative burden is also felt at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Harbour that there is always something to learn and improve on when it comes to the impact assessments. I consider we have been doing this for some time already, and I am very glad that the European Parliament is also introducing its own capacity to perform impact assessments on the amendments proposed in Parliament. I believe that through mutual efforts we can really improve the quality of the overall impact assessments for our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning our efficiency, for the year 2012 there is a proposal for 16 main initiatives. We have delivered eight already, and it is still not the end of the year. So I believe we will respect our traditional high level of fulfilment of our programmes. I have checked the figures, and in 2010-2011 we always delivered on over 90 % of what was in the programme. If we have slightly different figures, then let our experts get together so they can work on the same basis and arrive at the same figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the employment crisis, I fully agree with Enrique Guerrero Salom that this should be a top priority for the next year, as I indicated in my introductory remarks. This December we will introduce the youth employment package, as part of which we will propose the Youth Employment Guarantee Scheme. This will be based a little on the experience we have gathered through the work of the eight action teams we sent to the Member States with the highest youth unemployment. We believe that through the quick and swift reallocation of funds – which in most cases has already been done – we can create more than 400 000 jobs for young people that will be supported directly by the EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we were discussing the MFF. I can tell you that in my remarks to the Council there is one line which is repeated in all my remarks – make sure that 25 % of the EU funds under the next financial perspective are devoted to the European Social Fund. The Commission is very clear on this. We are saying that any kind of reduction in that percentage is not acceptable. I hope that we will be able to convince the Member States of this, because I also see it as a reflection of our using EU support to create the conditions for youth and the elderly to be employed and to have proper qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">The last issue, which was repeated by several speakers, is the situation concerning my former colleague, Commissioner Dalli and the tobacco directive. Concerning the resignation of Commissioner Dalli, it was quite clear that, after the Olaf investigation and the discussion of the Olaf report by the President of the Commission and the Commissioner, his position was untenable, especially vis-à-vis the reputation of the European Commission. Therefore, as you know, the process has already started for the appointment of the new Commissioner. I believe, after my initial contacts here in the European Parliament, that we can hold the hearing of the new Commissioner within a couple of weeks and that the new Commissioner could be in office very soon. I have already discussed the plan for the coming weeks with the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. We will have a meeting with Mr Harbour in a couple of minutes. What I want to make absolutely sure is that the work which has been started will continue. All the trialogue sessions will continue as planned.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the tobacco directive, for the Commission it is absolutely vital that it is this legislator, this Parliament, which will work on the tobacco directive. We want to make absolutely sure that we will present a good proposal upon which I believe this Parliament can reach at least a first reading agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it would be much more natural if the new Commissioner could start this process from the beginning, through the trialogues, until the end. I was very encouraged by the possible schedule for the appointment of the new Commissioner. I believe that the timescale will be very short, and I can assure you that it is a top priority for the Commission to present the tobacco directive in time for this Parliament to decide upon it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, there is no doubt that recession management will fail if it is based on the policies that lead to the crisis in the first place. I welcome the Commission’s work programme for 2013 because, in my view, its component parts represent an innovative shift away from the line adopted in previous years, and because in the interests of promoting economic recovery, it is based on two significant pillars of structural reform: reviving growth and ensuring budgetary discipline. I also welcome the Commission’s position as presented in the document ‘Towards a job-rich recovery. I am delighted that the changes in sectoral policy introduced with a view to creating jobs appear to be having the desired effect. I support the efforts of the Commission to improve governance mechanisms, notably the partnership principle that is to be applied to the drafting, implementation and evaluation of national reform programmes. In line with the European principle of solidarity, I welcome the Commission’s intention that this proposal should help prevent the Council from being able to impede the functioning of the EU Solidarity Fund, which provides assistance to Member States to deal with unforeseen disasters. I would like to highlight another observation based on a similar concept, namely that we need to bear in mind the subsidiarity principle when reallocating unused Structural Funds to the new growth measures and involve local and regional governments. I support the Commission’s work programme and hope that it will be implemented resolutely and successfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is nothing – absolutely nothing – in the Commission’s proposals about health and safety at work. It seems that alongside its regulatory agenda for the financial market – which, of course, I greatly welcome – it is operating a ‘deregulatory agenda’ for our companies and the business environment in which they operate. My fear is that this will lead to the systematic erosion of the basic minimum standards in place in the European Union. On the pretext that it wishes to improve the business environment for all of Europe’s companies (and with SMEs accounting for 98 % of companies in the EU, I think we can safely say that this refers to all of them) and stimulate the economy and industry in Europe, the EU’s existing acquis is weakened. This is especially noticeable, in my view, in relation to workers’ rights of codetermination; it is also apparent in relation to health standards and safety at work. The European social dialogue is put under massive pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore urge the Commission in 2013, the European Year of Citizens, to publish such a strategy in the form of a directive on violence against women. The same goes for equal pay for women and men. In a resolution adopted on 13 March 2012, Parliament called on the Commission to present a proposal reviewing current legislation implementing the principle of equal pay. We expect the Commission to put forward such a proposal in 2013. It is also necessary to resume work on the directive on non-discrimination. At a time of crisis, the European Union must take care of all its citizens. I am therefore calling on the Commission to make a determined effort to continue its work in this area and on the Member States to adopt the proposed directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission’s activities as regards boosting youth employment. The situation is critical. The average unemployment rate for young people in the EU is now more than 22 %, with 50 % of young people unemployed in some Member States. As a Parliament, we expect the Commission, as part of the umbrella communication on the employment package, to put forward clear targets and timetables, along with legislative proposals concerning youth mobility. The communication should also contain provisions relating to the ‘Youth Guarantee’, the quality framework for internships, language skills and youth entrepreneurship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These were the topics discussed in the Dalli case. Fighting corruption is a priority. When corruption is sanctioned outside the law, fighting it becomes an act of corruption in itself. The European Anti-Fraud Office has not found any direct evidence to prove that Commissioner Dalli is guilty. Nor has it indicated any legal text that has been contravened. Circumstantial evidence alone cannot overturn the presumption of innocence. The procedure followed by the Commission in the case of Mr Dalli leaves a stain on his reputation in every sense. If Mr Dalli is innocent, the sacrifice of an innocent Member would e a shame. If he is guilty, the Commission’s attempt to hide behind his ‘voluntary’ resignation, and the guilt of not having prevented the irregularities or sanctioned them promptly, would an act of cowardice and irresponsibility. To ask an innocent person to resign is an aberration. What then can you ask of a guilty one? To ask for proof of innocence goes against the principles of law. What is certain is that his resignation delays the adoption of the Tobacco Products Directive, to the delight of those who are opposed to it. Slander is cheaper than a bribe. Therefore, I wonder, who is the corrupt party: Mr Dalli or the European Commission ?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
