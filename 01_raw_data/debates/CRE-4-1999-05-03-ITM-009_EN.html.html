<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fourçans </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting this afternoon follows on from the Annual Economic Report we adopted on 11 March. Today"s report on the BEPG (broad economic policy guidelines) places greater emphasis on the economic strategy and the structural reforms needed according to the specific situation in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our text comprises two main sections, in line with the Commission"s proposals: the macro‐economic section and the structural section.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I would like to look at the macro‐economic section. Although a slow‐down in growth has been predicted for 1999, we are not talking about a recession, which means that there is no reason to change the overall economic strategy in Europe. In other words, we need to develop our strategy along the lines of a good policy mix where salary increases correspond to productivity gains with a view to promoting growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, budget deficits must continue to decrease and the necessary adjustments must be introduced according to the speed with which this reduction occurs. This means that automatic stabilisers should have a part to play, but I would stress that they must not jeopardise any reduction achieved in public deficits which is absolutely vital for growth and employment today and, above all, in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is to be achieved, such a reduction should be mirrored, where possible, by a reduction in taxes and other levies, or at least by their stabilisation. This approach requires greater control over state expenditure and improved effectiveness and quality in terms of public expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards monetary policy, we should of course like to emphasise the importance of the ECB"s independence, which is essential for it to best fulfil its role in the area of price stability and guarantee the conditions that encourage growth and employment. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, it should indeed be independent, but not at the expense of the vital democratic accountability that we in the European Parliament must vigilantly ensure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second section of our proposal relates to structural reform. If unemployment is to be significantly and permanently reduced, growth is undoubtedly important, but it will only be achieved by way of thorough, consistent reforms that are adapted to suit the specific characteristics of each of our Member States, as advocated by the Commission. What is more, such reforms need to be carried out over a period of time in a consistent and determined manner.</p>
<p class="contents">What do these reforms involve? I shall not go into details here but I would simply like to tell you about the general ideas. Improving the workings of the single market and the European markets in general is one of the key aspects. In order to achieve this, Commissioners, there needs to be greater integration in terms of the financial markets. Moreover, the markets in goods and services also need to be opened up as they provide the greatest number of jobs. The level of participation in the labour markets must also be increased and we must render them more flexible by adapting the social welfare systems and reducing labour costs, particularly for workers with less skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, we must continue to liberalise the telecommunications, energy and transport sectors and guarantee better financing for SMEs. We also need to reform the social welfare and tax systems as well as the education and professional training systems.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the direction in which European economic policy should be moving. No doubt you will say that it is an ambitious programme, and I agree. But the public must be told the truth, especially in this pre‐election period. They should be made aware that this type of reform is needed if unemployment is to be genuinely tackled and that the sooner it is implemented, the sooner we can begin to reap the fruits of our labour.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Menrad </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, this report from the Employment Committee was originally supposed to deal mainly with a Commission communication on Article 127 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is to say with the mainstreaming of employment policies at Community level. The committee decided also to include the European Employment Pact planned for the Cologne summit. This became the main subject of the committee"s report when publication of the communication was delayed by the Commission"s resignation. The communication did subsequently appear, however, on the very day after the vote on my draft report had been taken in the Social Affairs Committee. It is now sensible to include it in Parliament"s report together with several amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 6.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also under pressure of time with our opinion on the Fourçans report on the Commission"s recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines, which it is also my task to deliver. We should like to thank Mr Fourçans for his very fine work and also for the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has taken on board some important points made in the opinion of the Social Affairs Committee. His report explains how the recommendation is exceptional in two respects. Firstly, these are the first broad economic policy guidelines since the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999. And secondly, for the first time, job creation is seen as the most important aim of economic policy. We recommend the adoption of the Fourçans report.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let us return to the Employment Pact. The comment made by the chairman of the special summit on employment held in Luxembourg in 1997, Jean‐Claude Juncker, also applies to the Cologne summit: it must not be a literary convention. He was referring to the many declarations made at previous summits which were not binding. In fact, a whole series of worthwhile, practical initiatives were decided on in Luxembourg and that is why we do not, thankfully, need to start from scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the European Council in Cologne has to make a tangible improvement on Luxembourg. To sustain a high level of employment, a longer‐term strategy for tapping society"s potential in terms of creativity, innovation, pioneering spirit and willingness to invest and perform needs to be developed, in accordance with the employment guidelines. Institutional reforms to promote dynamic competition and flexibility have to be coordinated with the need to maintain – but also to modernise – social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the Employment Committee"s report calls for the following: an increase in the number of unemployed people to benefit from an active support measure such as vocational training or job‐creation measures, compared with the proposals in the guidelines; the autonomy of the European Central Bank and the two sides of industry; and further efforts to consolidate public finances. We specifically declare our support for the stability pact; respecting it makes it possible for interest rates to be lowered and thus to stimulate investment.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, we recommend a wage policy geared to productivity. If profits and investment in new jobs are increased as a result of wage restraint, then it is not enough to fob the employees off with a simple thank you for that restraint. The Social Affairs Committee believes that there should be voluntary schemes allowing them to participate in both profits and capital. In return for a moderate wage agreement, employers might also increase their investment in human capital or recruit more workers and trainees.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we call for intelligent working models and the reduction of overtime, for flexibility instead of a unilateral reduction in working time with full pay, an easing of the tax burden on labour, the convergence of corporate taxes to prevent the relocation of undertakings solely on tax grounds, and finally regular meetings of the political decision‐makers with the two sides of industry and the European Central Bank so that common strategies can be agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee, we also discussed the issue of whether special employment programmes for specific groups – such as young people or the long‐term unemployed – ought to be implemented and financed at European level, on top of the national action plans and measures carried out by the Member States under the Structural Funds. This would be wrong. Subsidised employment programmes costing billions would be completely wrong – they are neither the right response to structural unemployment nor should they be financed at European level. On the other hand, greater cooperation when formulating national policies – through rigorous application of the employment policy guidelines and action plans and improved monitoring – means European added value, which, together with the stabilising effect of a hard common currency in the European internal market, will in the medium term also contribute to there being more jobs and less jobless, which is an important precondition for the social dimension of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I ask you to vote in favour of this report. I will close by telling you that colleagues from all the groups supported me in the committee by making constructive criticism and tabling constructive amendments.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Herman </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fourçans report is important not only because it fully endorses the Commission"s recommendations, but also because it plays a clear part in the political debate that has caused a great stir among European circles, including within this Parliament. The debate focuses on whether or not the introduction of the euro has given rise to the need to relax the budgetary and monetary discipline that led to the historic decision of May 1998, with a view to promoting a more tentative form of economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">The position adopted by the Commission and by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in this connection is qualified: while price stability is guaranteed and maintained, we can be more flexible as regards monetary policy, provided of course that budgetary discipline is maintained and continued. In fact, productive private investment has deliberately had to slow down for years precisely because of the enormous debt accumulated and the substantial sums given to finance both this debt and our deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the advantages of this report is that it has prevented us from giving in to the temptation that entraps many a politician on the eve of an election, namely giving into the people"s demands. However, the people are calling for fewer sacrifices and more handouts, which is naturally incompatible with the demands of budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Placing the emphasis on macro‐economic resources is much more attractive. Changing interest rates and extending public deficits are far more popular initiatives than the unwelcome measures of restoring the balance of social security, increasing the flexibility of the labour market and reducing labour costs for the least skilled.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore welcome the fact that on the eve of the elections, Parliament, like the Commission, has been able to tackle the demands of the economy and managed quite honourably to resist the pressures of public opinion, the media and other pressure groups. This is why, Madam President, we welcome this report and will vote for it enthusiastically.</p>

In recent months, we have on occasions had a robust discussion on which way to go: should we have an expansive policy as advocated by the Social Democrat group, along the lines of what Mr Lafontaine would like, or should we stick to the rules that we agreed? I think it is a good thing – and it is presented in a balanced way in the report – that we have opted for that line, namely to stick to the rules. A measure of support is now developing among the Social Democrats too for implementing these kinds of structural measures, which are so important for ensuring the internal stability of the euro: low inflation, which brings lower costs and which also enables more jobs to be created through the structural measures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is important not only for getting people into work, but also for those who are drawing their pensions. We shall have to guarantee this stability in future, and on the other hand we must ensure that there is greater flexibility. If we can stabilise our financial position – which is up to the Member States, and in that regard I am extremely happy with the Commission"s response here, which Mr Fourçans emphasises in his report – in such a way that more jobs can also be created in the future, then we shall amongst other things strengthen our competitive position vis‐à‐vis the United States. In short, then: let us have more people in work in the Union and better provision for those taking part in the work process in these Member States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moreau </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, the recent events that led to the Commission"s resignation scarcely instilled it with the modesty they should have done, to say the least. In fact, the Commission"s arrogance has once again manifested itself in its recommendations on the broad economic policy guidelines. How can we simply stand by and watch the Commission once again lecture the governments of the Member States in as diverse areas as public finance, social welfare and the labour market? Each country has received a good dressing‐down. Some are accused of budgetary relaxation, some are being clearly encouraged to reform their pension, health and welfare systems, while others have been told off for the lack of flexibility and adaptability of their labour markets or for being too slow in liberalising their public markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an authoritative approach is all the more intolerable since these problems are a result of the guidelines that have been in place for years and that have led to the high unemployment rates and poverty experienced by the majority of our countries. These guidelines are based on the reduction of labour costs and they hamper growth. I welcome the fact that certain governments have expressed their support for relaxing budgetary constraints, and the Central Bank itself has had to take account of the risks of a slow‐down in growth by cutting interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">However, budgetary relaxation alone will not be enough: the straitjacket of the stability pact must be replaced by a genuine growth and employment pact. This is why, in our view, the Cologne European Council must put an end to the grand and noble declarations on employment and commit itself to actually implementing effective measures. Our group has proposed several initiatives in this respect: boosting public investment through the release of additional resources, including at Community level; continuing to cut interest rates, using a more selective approach, with a view to encouraging projects that create jobs; reducing working hours without reducing salaries or flexibility; and establishing minimum wages.</p>
<p class="contents">These employment policies should be integrated into all Community policies and be accompanied by quantified objectives that are binding and that can be monitored. Unemployment will only decrease significantly if such measures are adopted.</p>

This is very much a question of the simplest jobs having disappeared in our society, with differences in pay growing so enormous that some people are paid huge amounts of money for what they do, while others would in fact be more productive, in the traditional sense of the word, if they were not in the labour market at all. But that is in no way an acceptable state of affairs, either for society or from the human dignity point of view. Member States should make low incomes free of tax and lower the rate of taxation across the board since at present, for example, it is deterring people from even accepting temporary employment. Part‐time workers and those engaged in atypical work should qualify for welfare and a pension if we wish to take responsibility for people who have to resort to atypical employment more and more.</p>

<p class="contents">Budgetary discipline remains a good idea in all the Member States. Without good budgetary planning, it is very tempting to resort to a broad monetary policy to ease the pain.</p>
<p class="contents">Popular support in the Member States for a tight financial and economic policy is an unpredictable factor. It is worrying that in some Member States, EMU discipline rests on one‐off measures and not on structural change. The analysis commissioned from the Netherlands Economic Institute makes it clear that the main problem‐cases in terms of EMU, and the ones which need more careful attention, are Portugal, Italy and France. Can the Commission and the Council guarantee that they will receive it?</p>
<p class="contents">In future, most countries will face a funding problem due to the fact of an ageing population. By no means all the Member States have yet begun to address this problem. Systems for financing retirement benefits, pensions and health care will need to be radically revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain are Member States which remain sensitive to fluctuations in the rate of interest on their national debt. These countries need to modify the scheduling of their national debt and make sound progress on reducing their budget deficit.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Randzio‐Plath </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, it is good that the European Parliament"s report on the broad economic policy guidelines in the Community and the Member States strongly emphasises how essential it is to coordinate economic policies, and that it goes even further than the Commission proposal by also demanding practical initiatives. The fact is that structural measures and labour market policy are only part of the answer to the unemployment problem, which we are all concerned about. What is decisive is whether we can achieve growth rates in excess of 3 % in Europe and in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For this to be the case, economic policy must fulfil its responsibilities in terms of employment policy and ensure that there is a balanced and appropriate policy mix in the European Union with instruments geared towards supply and demand. We need economic policies to be coordinated so that we can engineer and guarantee higher, sustainable growth. You see, monetary policy is no longer responsible only for price stability, financial policy only for a sound public budget, and wage policy only for pay trends. If the Central Bank, the State and the two sides of industry can work as a team – while fully respecting the independence of the individual parties – they will be able to exert a decisive influence on investment, growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">All three players must therefore in any case be placed under an obligation to contribute to a balanced and appropriate policy mix in the Community. An essential part of this is a financial policy which will help in particular to increase investment and which will not try to consolidate without considering the economy. We need an incomes policy which will help to increase households" purchasing power without triggering increases in labour costs which exceed increases in productivity – which means that pay trends must be compatible with productivity gains, but should not fall below them either – and we need a monetary policy which will contribute to economic growth by delivering price stability. That is why the ECB"s decision to cut interest rates was the right decision and an important step forward. The ECB has finally made its contribution to growth and employment in accordance with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the Member States will also have more scope for investment in their budgets, even though consolidation is still an important goal. It should be borne in mind, however, that fiscal measures are one way of responding to cyclical or local blips in demand and that their effects vary from country to country. Establishing a strict deficit ceiling can definitely have an adverse effect, and greater account needs to be taken of individual situations. Apart from this, where are the proposals for how the Member States can stimulate public sector investment while still respecting the 3 % ceiling? The guidelines need to give pointers here.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe still underestimates the significance of cross‐border infrastructure projects, and here – five years after the Delors White Paper was discussed at the European summit – the Council of European Finance Ministers is requested finally to produce European added value in the fields of transport infrastructure and information and communication structures, to push through modernisation schemes and here also to make offensive use of the European Investment Bank, so that in view of the sluggish economy, an upturn will be stimulated more than it has been hitherto by European public sector investment, if possible in partnership with private investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and employment policy complement and support each other. The Employment Pact must play a special role. It can only do so if the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment policy guidelines are drawn up at the same time, so that both sets of guidelines apply when both national budgets and the European budget are established. If fighting mass unemployment is the number one challenge for the future of Europe, then it is not only necessary for those involved to agree; the context in which action should be taken, as well as what it should consist of and the timetable, must be laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is how economic and employment policy can actually be linked together and if, in addition to this, tax policy also makes a contribution, for example through a reduced VAT rate being applied on labour‐intensive services, then Europe will be able to make considerable progress.</p>

In paragraph 4, the rapporteur rightly acknowledges the modest performance of the European Union in terms of growth and employment and in paragraph 16 he notes that public investment is not always given the priority it should enjoy compared to operation expenditure. In paragraph 23, the rapporteur states that vigilance is required in view of the prospects of possible deflation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all well and good, but these observations do not lead the rapporteur to question any of the dogmas on which European economic integration is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the example of the euro. The introduction of the euro prevents Member States from implementing monetary policies to regulate their situation. In the event of an asymmetric shock, which the report does not mention, those states that would be most affected, for example, by inflation, would no longer be able to fight it through a differential monetary policy. However, fiscal policy could naturally still be used, while wage policy or the unemployment rate could always be used as adjustment variables.</p>
<p class="contents">However, calls for tax coordination, which is unfortunately advocated by the rapporteur in paragraph 34, mean that this second means of adjustment would no longer be open to the Member States. So unemployment is left as a regulatory instrument or pressure on wages, and why not indeed? The problem however is that, quite frankly, no one is prepared to acknowledge this for obvious electoral reasons, as this would make the euro and its creators unpopular.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, speaking on behalf of a committee dominated by the PSE Group and the PPE Group, could not of course express any point of view other than that of those two groups, and so could not denounce the fact that the Socialist policies implemented in 13 of the 15 Member States would put Europe at a competitive disadvantage in the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">The combination of the global free trade movement and the increase in social and fiscal burdens, which are a result of these Socialist policies, partly explains Europe"s low growth rate, particularly in comparison to the United States. There can be no social progress without economic growth, but there can be no growth where the spirit of enterprise is scorned by egalitarianism and bureaucratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Socialism is thus backfiring on the people because of its poor economic management and its dogmatic cosmopolitanism. The broad guidelines of a European policy should move away from state control and cosmopolitanism as these are the two things that essentially benefit the dominant American economy. Moreover, I regret the fact that the rapporteur did not consider it appropriate to mention the effects of the United States domination of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is unfortunate that the self‐censorship that has prevailed in this report – which was unavoidable as there was undoubtedly no alternative – forced the rapporteur to limit his work to purely technical aspects, although it was often very thorough, without tackling the fundamental political issues facing our economies, which will one day have to be tackled before our people.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Lancker </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I have to say that we are especially glad, at this late stage, to be able to give our views and have a discussion on the European Employment Pact. Whilst Amsterdam and Luxembourg placed jobs fair and square on the European agenda, it is obvious that the Luxembourg process alone will not be enough to bring about a drastic reduction in unemployment in Europe. What we really lack is a strategy, a macro‐economic European strategy and a structural employment policy which hang together, enabling us to focus our full attention on the right goals.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the German Presidency"s proposal to make headway on a European Employment Pact. Indeed, the European Parliament itself has always insisted that a pact on employment is required, since the stability pact urgently needs something to counterbalance it. But in all honesty, the provisional version of this Employment Pact looks a touch anaemic. It will not be an umpteenth rehash of fine words as a policy mix or a revamp of social security, served up with a dash of Luxembourg sauce, that gives the European Union a decent policy on jobs. And quite frankly, the economic guidelines now before us simply continue to swear by an increasingly tight policy of cutbacks for many Member States, and the belief that flexible wage structures, a deregulated labour market and reductions in social protection will create jobs is definitely not my idea of what a European Employment Pact ought to be. It is more of an American‐style cocktail which does nothing new to stimulate growth and merely makes for more social inequality and more uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe"s Socialists and Social Democrats, inspired by Antoni Gutiérres, made proposals of their own for a pact on jobs at a congress in Milan, and I am delighted to see that both Martine Aubry and Dominique Strauss‐Kahn have adopted large parts of these. The message is very clear, Commissioner. Certainly the European Pact must not be an empty vessel, but nor must it be a neo‐liberal recipe book. It must contain concrete measures and must get all those involved to make clear commitments – the European Central Bank, the social partners, the ECOFIN Council and the Social Affairs Council. The key elements which we believe must feature in a pact of this kind include first and foremost a European strategy for growth. The current growth forecast of 2 % looks set to create even more unemployment. The special action programme agreed in Amsterdam was a good decision, but far too modest. So the European Investment Bank and the Fund must free up new resources and the Member States must also be enabled, through their own budgetary policies, to give their economies a shot in the arm, not by making the stability pact more rigorous but by interpreting it more flexibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need a fiscal policy which is an incentive, rather than a disincentive, to employment. The decision on VAT on labour‐intensive services is all very well, but in the meantime we still have the Monti proposals, the Primarolo proposals as our staple fare, if I can put it like that. This log‐jam urgently needs to be cleared; we have to revive our European fiscal agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the guidelines on employment must be strengthened and given specific shape. One specific commitment might be this: if all the Member States did as well on jobs as the top three scorers, we could get not 150 million but 180 million people into work. And in any event, we urgently need to restore the link between work and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need more coordination, more coordination between the guidelines on employment and the economic guidelines, not so much as regards timing but as regards substance. We cannot go on having economic guidelines which preach budgetary discipline and at the same time guidelines on employment which are subordinate to them. We shall never get a serious strategy for growth that way. It is this that the Cologne summit needs to understand, and I hope that somebody will listen.</p>

I should like to thank Mr Fourçans and Commissioner de Silguy very much for explaining their economic policy guidelines so clearly both here and in the documents. I know that they have been the subject of much controversy for many years. Today we have the euro, and today no one is disputing the fact that their proposals are right nor that Mr Menrad"s report, which covers the employment policy side, is a very good report, which can be debated here alongside the Fourçans report.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to Mrs Randzio‐Plath, I do wonder whether she has actually already given up on the stability and growth pact. After all, she has repeatedly stressed these points in the committee as well. I think it is absolutely essential for the three most important aspects to be respected, that is the stability and growth pact, a wage policy geared to productivity, and the need for structural reform. In recent weeks and months, we have discussed what economic and financial strategy is right for the euro zone time and again. Article 105 of the EU Treaty leaves no room for ambiguity here. As far as the European Central Bank"s tasks are concerned, economic policy is clearly secondary to price stability. Should we step up coordination of economic policy? Yes, that is also laid down in the Treaty. Should a conventional interventionist economic policy à la Keynes be pursued to control the economy? No!</p>
<p class="contents">Chronic unemployment in Europe will not be eliminated by means of a European employment programme or by the Member States in the European economic and monetary union having a uniform economic policy, but by means of structural reform. There can be no doubt that the stability pact was right, is right and will continue to be right. I see that Mr Diller, Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Finance, is with us. Your former boss, Mr Lafontaine, came up against a brick wall in Europe with his ideas on this subject, did he not? Basically, he failed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that monetary policy should not be obstructive to economic and financial policy. Of course it is also true that if there are stable interest rates, stable prices and low interest rates, Member States will have considerably more scope to eliminate chronic unemployment than they had before. It is therefore necessary not to ease budgetary discipline; to do so would not be prudent, as Mr Herman has emphasised. On the reform measures, several colleagues have mentioned flexible labour markets. Mrs Van Lancker spoke about the pension system. I think that Germany, which has a pension system funded by contributions, will actually experience serious difficulties in the long term, and that in one generation it will simply not be possible to build up a fund system to run alongside the contributions system. Very wide‐ranging structural reforms are therefore required, which must prevent problems also being caused by the State placing too great a burden on GNP, unduly high taxes and social and benefits policies making excessive demands.</p>
<p class="contents">If coordinating economic policy triggers a process of learning and competition, with people asking ‘How do the other countries actually go about this?" then this will achieve more than illusionary spending programmes. Competition between the countries in the euro zone will call many traditional systems into question. I believe that this is right and proper!</p>

We have the internal market and we have EMU, but Europe needs more. I should like to focus today on unrestricted fiscal competition. With help from the Commissioner, we have achieved some progress here, but the Council is not doing enough. It is the Council which is dragging its feet on a number of very important issues, for example switching labour costs into environmental and energy taxes, and now it seems that this dossier too is being blocked. It is precisely these areas which offer great opportunities. At my instigation, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs produced a report on production levies and green taxes, and this shows that the introduction of this kind of taxation at European level could have a major impact on jobs. I would urge the Commission to read this report by Parliament"s research departments.</p>
<p class="contents">Worker mobility continues to be hampered by the fact that earned income is taxed twice by virtue of the different treatment given to allowances and taxation in the Member States. I therefore think that with regard to social security and pensions, it is very important to pursue convergence between the Member States. I am not advocating the imposition of European legislation ‘from the top down", but efforts towards convergence can certainly be made ‘from the bottom up", and that will most definitely be needed if we are to secure the financial future of our ageing populations. I would make the point once again that a huge demographic shock awaits us, and that the European Union needs to coordinate its policy for coping with this.</p>

Furthermore, in addition to these general trends, it mentions each specific country in turn – acknowledging that each country has its own peculiarities – addresses the issue of the growth of its economy and puts forward the necessary reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">This change was necessary, and I would like to point out that it is in keeping with the flexible interpretation and orientation of the criteria contained in the Treaty and which I have time and again supported. The very existence of economic and monetary union demonstrates that this is not just a formality. On the contrary, it addresses economic and monetary issues in a dynamic way and calls for the coordination not only of the monetary but also the economic and social policies of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that this flexibility must also extend to the structural framework. If general economic policies are not coordinated, monetary policy will be ineffective and will not have the desired validity to enable the currency of the European Union to play its true role. In these circumstances, therefore, we must avoid any potential split within the European Union and we must aim to incorporate all Member States into EMU as quickly as possible. Only in this way will it be possible to achieve the more effective, comprehensive, coordinated reforms that the Commission is calling for. And only in this way will we be able to have real economic and monetary union, as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the statement made by the Commission on this issue, which seems to open the way for a more rational and more effective economic approach, the main characteristics of which are quite rightly highlighted, discussed and enhanced by our rapporteur, Mr Fourçans in his excellent piece of work.</p>

Last year it was possible to bring unemployment down to 10 %. This pleasing, though by no means adequate trend cannot, however, as claimed in many quarters, be attributed to the employment policy measures taken by the Union. The realisation that the efforts made by the Union hitherto, including the NAPs, have been insufficient and have had little success is another reason why this Employment Pact is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to take a positive view of these reports, then we can say that we have recognised the problems and have ideas about how to tackle them. But ideas and an awareness of the problem alone will not create a single job. The will and the ideas are there, but there is a big gap when it comes to implementing the measures. There are only limited ways in which the Union itself can create jobs. This is the task of the nation states and companies, in particular the SMEs on which we must focus all our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating one new job costs around ATS 1 million in my national currency. Since 1989, therefore, the appropriations in the Structural Funds alone could have created six million jobs!

It may not be quite so astonishing, because unfortunately the election campaign has of course already started; were this not the case, then perhaps the speeches would have turned out somewhat differently. Mr Menrad has tabled a good and reasonable report which my group can also support, provided our amendments are accepted. He is right that we do not need to start from scratch with everything. We have experience at national level in a few Member States, but at European level, formulating the Employment Pact and implementing it is new territory. The national action plans were also new territory, and unlike the previous speaker, I strongly believe that the Luxembourg guidelines and the national action plans have contributed to the fall in unemployment. Of course more needs to be done; no one is disputing that, and it is mentioned in both reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am largely in agreement with you, Mr Menrad, I should like to mention a few further points on which our views differ, and nor do I think that the German Government has such a narrow view on this as you described, Mr Langen. We obviously welcomed the stability pact, but an additional stability policy which strangles public budgets, robbing them of all political room for manoeuvre and making it impossible for them to create the necessary basic conditions in education, research and training, is no good to anyone. That is not the kind of stability pact that we had in mind. Nor is it sufficient – and Mrs Van Lancker is right here – for the ESF to be our only source of funding for employment policy; in any event, that is another matter which will have to be dealt with in the next parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to give the German Presidency, which will be presenting the Employment Pact in Cologne, something to think about: please bear in mind that as a parliament, we obviously expect to be involved in this.</p>

<p class="contents">We are now discussing reports by three of my colleagues in the PPE Group. I should like to congratulate them on a constructive outcome. We should allow Mr Fourçans' prescription for a sound economic policy to form the basis of the medicine the European labour market needs. Mrs Thyssen's contribution, which concentrates on labour‐intensive services, is unfortunately still required. There is clear proof that high taxes are discouraging an above‐board, expanded market in services.</p>
<p class="contents">The information, white collar and services sectors are underdeveloped in Europe compared with the USA, for example. In point of fact, this is the area in which tomorrow's jobs lie, which we cannot afford to tax out of existence. Consequently, extensive structural reforms are also needed in the different European markets. The common market should be realised and exploited to its full potential. Monetary union increases pressure on competition but, properly handled, it can also increase European competitiveness and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks also go to the Commission, in particular to the present Commissioners, who have tirelessly focused on the lack of dynamism, the need for change and, in particular, on the role of national governments and parliaments in undertaking measures to reduce fiscal pressure, stabilise public finances and improve the labour market and training methods in the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us use the European Union to create the right conditions for entrepreneurship, growth and new jobs – not to regulate the jobs we need out of existence or to sit here and believe that we can redistribute and ‘talk up' the new jobs and tomorrow's opportunities in this Europe of ours.</p>

We all know that the structure of the economy differs widely in the various Member States. When countries have such different structures, as is the case in the Union, imposing the same economic principles results in disagreement and conflict. If one wishes to achieve harmonisation, however, the policy should instead take account of national differences and be adapted to the national structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should finally stop allowing itself to be guided by abstract theories on harmonisation which bear no relation at all to hard and fast reality!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lienemann </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is somewhat surprising that the European Union, on the one hand, is engaged in a well organised debate on the broad economic policy guidelines, with all the known constraints and a rigorous stability pact, and on the other hand, has an employment policy with only vaguely defined guidelines. And this is in spite of constant assertions that employment is the biggest issue facing Europe and Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">We should firstly like to see the European institutions fall into step and bring the two facets of economic policy and employment policy together. However, it is clear that if we do not get out of the rut we are in, there will not be sufficient growth to reduce unemployment. The European memorandum proposed by the French and Italian Ministers for Employment explicitly urges the European Union to set itself a 3 % growth limit for the next few years. However, this will not be possible without tough decisions. So what type of decisions can we expect?</p>
<p class="contents">First, we will need a policy to boost major initiatives as advocated by Jacques Delors. Frequent reference is made to this type of proposal but no specific financial and operational commitments are ever really made.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, if growth is to receive a boost, internal demand must be supported. I should like to remind you that growth in the United States is heavily reliant on internal demand. There is certainly no miracle for achieving this: if internal demand is to recover, wages firstly need to be supported. Therefore, the policy of wage moderation, which has all too often prevailed, needs to be reversed. Furthermore, productivity gains and wage increases must go hand in hand. Consumer tax must be reduced, and we believe that VAT should also be lowered, particularly in those sectors that create a high number of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, public investment must be given a fresh impetus, for example, in the major initiatives mentioned earlier and also in research. These grand declarations that welcome the reduction in state aid to companies still give cause for concern because there is an unwillingness to accept at the same time that the majority of these large privatised companies no longer invest in vital research or in research and development and as a consequence stunt our technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the issue of employment does not boil down to the issue of growth, however essential it might be. Since the dawn of civilisation we have worked less to produce more and I do not see why this secular movement should stop. It is time for a new stage in terms of a reduction in working time, which should provide the opportunity to better distribute the wealth produced. Europe may indeed suffer from high unemployment, but it has never been as wealthy. The problem is that this wealth is poorly distributed. We therefore need to create a fairer tax system, as harmonisation is not enough. There should be greater tax on capital and less tax on labour. We need to invest in the future through public investment in major initiatives and research. Working time must be reduced and alongside this reduction we must train our workforce. The national employment plans are very positive from this point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinion, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is that it we have not achieved the right balance. Today we have 13 Socialist‐led governments whose electorates, like the peoples of Europe, expect them to implement a policy that not only helps employment but also creates a social model that is not based on insecurity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the advent of the euro has also changed the general guidelines for economic policy. Independence is no longer an option, now that eleven countries of the European Union form one monetary zone with a single central bank and a single monetary policy. The economic policy mix urgently needs to be decided now at European level. And it will be. The question is simply whether or not political considerations will play a sufficiently active part in that. Against the background of the need for an active European policy mix, I am perplexed by the Commission"s proposal for general economic policy guidelines. Instead of moving us forward, the Commission is pushing us back. Why?</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the European policy mix has hitherto consisted of recommendations for national budgetary policy, the monetary policy of central banks and the wage policy operated by the social partners, the birth of the euro has evidently prompted the Commission to stop giving monetary policy any active role in the overall European policy mix. It is as if governments and the social partners could determine economic policy on their own and as if the ECB did not also have a role in supporting economic policy. There is a history to this debate, and I put it to you that the Commission is setting itself up here as a kind of secretariat for conservative forces within the ECB which argue that the ECB"s second duty under Article 105 of the Treaty, namely to support economic policy – without prejudice to the maintenance of price stability – can be discharged simply by maintaining a sufficient degree of price stability. I would refer you to the policy strategy outlined in the ECB"s first monthly report. Happily, however, ECB President Duisenberg made it clear at last Monday"s latest parliamentary hearing that the interest cut of 8 April was precisely an attempt to help kick‐start the Union economy, in other words he acknowledged in so many words that monetary policy too has an economic function. So I think it is a big mistake – fortunately identified as such in the Fourçans report – to reduce the policy mix to nothing more than tasks to be performed by government and the social partners. No, that is not on. You have to return, Commissioner de Silguy, to a policy mix in which monetary policy also plays its part in influencing economic policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to point out that I intend to focus on issues relating to the broad economic policy guidelines, or BEPG, and Mr Mario Monti will deal with the other report, that is, the Menrad report on the European Employment Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Fourçans on his excellent report and on the excellent work he has accomplished within such a short space of time, something I should also like to congratulate you on. The BEPG constitute both a vital and key instrument for the effective coordination of economic policies in Europe. This, Mrs Lienemann, certainly puts employment at the top of the priorities of the European governments, but it is also high among the priorities of the Commission and, of course, this House. The Ecofin Council will examine the BEPG on 10 May, before they are ratified by the Heads of State and Government in Cologne at the beginning of June.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Metten, I have already given a detailed presentation of the Commission"s recommendation to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and, bearing in mind the limited time available this evening, I should like to concentrate my speech on responding to your rapporteur"s questions and comments and to the other points that have been raised this evening. To make things easier, my comments shall focus on two areas: the present economic situation and the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the economic situation in Europe is improving, albeit slowly. In spite of the uncertainties recently reflected in public opinion polls, the present outlook is favourable and the economic essentials of the European Union are becoming healthier. Proof of this lies in the positive outlook for consumption and household confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The slow‐down in world growth only has a limited and temporary impact on growth in Europe. Growth in Europe is set to speed up during the year to reach an annual rate of between 2.5 % and 3 % by the end of 1999. Recent monetary developments, Mr Metten, are boosting the confidence of economic agents and should have positive repercussions, particularly for private investment. However, as you are well aware, I never comment on the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, so as to avoid being accused of undermining the sacrosanct principle of independence.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment situation is improving, although it is certainly not improving fast enough, Mrs Moreau. I listened carefully to what you said, Mrs Van Lancker, and looking at the figures, I see that employment is set to increase by 0.8 % in 1999 and by 0.8 % in the year 2000. It increased by 1.1 % in 1998. The projected increase is very small, but it is proof that Europe"s unemployment curve has been reversed and that our growth is generating more jobs. Of course, this is still not enough and that is precisely why the broad economic policy guidelines have been presented: they enable us to put forward an economic strategy that has been pursued for several years and that has been adapted, and as your rapporteur pointed out, there is no reason why we should change the present economic strategy. Instead, we should follow the same course and step up the action taken to support growth and combat unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the support that your rapporteur has given to the strategy advocated in the recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines for 1999. I shall not go back over this. There is just one point regarding structural reform that I should like to highlight so as to demonstrate the Commission"s willingness to assess the liberalisation of the telecommunications, transport and energy sectors. An analysis of these network industries will soon be published and the Commission has no objection to the use of best practices in national legislation where company rules are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My second set of comments relates to the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines. Mr Metten, far from being a mere secretariat of the Council, the Commission this year put forward recommendations for each country. In doing so, it aims to ensure that the broad guidelines are a sufficient test to demonstrate Member States" willingness to specifically coordinate economic policies, Mrs Lienemann, by using the instruments they have established for this purpose. I should like to add, for Mr Christodoulou"s benefit, that the broad guidelines apply to all 15 Member States, even though some of the provisions of the Treaty are limited specifically to the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this coordination mainly involves two aspects. Although Mrs Boogerd‐Quaak brought up another issue, that of the ageing of the population, I should just like to mention two aspects very briefly. The first of these is the budgetary policy. I would like to know whether or not the Member States are prepared to accept the specific country‐by‐country objectives laid down by the Commission. In other words, I want to know if some of them are prepared to take regulatory measures to face up to the current developments highlighted by the Commission"s recent forecasts. These are the real issues the Member States must debate because they lie at the very heart of the process of strengthening budgetary coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue of concern is employment. The Commission"s recommendation on the broad guidelines sets out national objectives for structural reform for each Member State. This is something that, as I remember, was mentioned by both Mrs Moreau and Mrs Randzio‐Plath, whether in relation to the labour market or a more active employment policy. Are the Member States prepared to accept the objectives recommended by the Commission without toning them down? Here again I ask the question. In Dresden, the finance ministers were responsible for drawing up a European Employment Pact. Mr Mario Monti will answer you on that point and I shall not go into it any further. I just wanted to emphasise the fact that following the example of your rapporteur, the German Presidency suggested in this regard that we should promote macro‐economic dialogue among all the elements of the policy mix. This is why the Commission is proposing that the social partners present a common position to the Cologne European Council and is also recommending that in the future an annual meeting be held with the social partners before the spring European Council which adopts the broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, within the framework of improving the integration of employment in the economic policy, your rapporteur suggests that we should do away with the present separation of the broad guidelines and the guidelines for employment. I think you are right and it is worth asking whether it would not be better in fact to guarantee greater complementarity between the two elements, including in terms of the timetables involved. This is something the Commission is considering.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by saying that, in relation to the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines, the Commission sincerely hopes that, contrary to what happened last year, Member States are able, in this first year of the euro, to agree on a specific, limited content for these guidelines, which is operational and which is not toned down, particularly as regards the recommendations for each country in the area of employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress that the Commission gladly supports your proposal to systematically carry out an annual assessment of the way in which the broad guidelines are implemented by the Member States from spring 2000, on the basis of these country‐by‐country recommendations. This would undoubtedly help us to strengthen a genuine European economic policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Mr Flynn, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Menrad for his report and by thanking the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its rapid work on the draft resolution. We fully share the views expressed on the European Employment Pact. In addition, Mr Menrad has stressed the need to mainstream employment in Community policies. This is fully in line with the communication adopted by the Commission on this subject on 21 April. By reiterating Parliament's support for the Luxembourg process and correctly insisting on the support which the European Social Fund must give to the European employment strategy, the report and resolution have given timely messages.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear about what we are seeking from the European Employment Pact. As requested by the Vienna European Council such a pact should establish a dialogue involving all the actors with responsibility for designing policies which impact on economic growth and employment creation. This dialogue should fully respect the autonomy of the various actors and take place at different levels as suggested in the draft resolution before Parliament today. As regards macro‐economic policy, there should be an exchange of views between the relevant actors on each element in the macro‐economic policy mix, fiscal policy, wage trends and monetary policy, so that each can fully support the growth and employment process.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Amsterdam Treaty and its Article 127 enter into force, there should be an assessment of the impact of all relevant policies on employment. In our recent communication on this issue, the Commission outlined how a range of policies can promote a high level of employment and how policies are increasingly being directed towards this objective. The Communication deals, for example, with ways of encouraging and supporting investment in capital and human resources in order to strengthen the European Union economy. It examines how structural reforms can make markets work better and thus help achieve sustainable growth and employment. It refers to the modernisation of social protection and of taxation systems in order to improve work incentives and opportunities for entering or returning to the labour market. We are pleased to find that all these points are referred to in the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Further practical steps will be needed to assess how the various Community policies can contribute more to the employment objective and, where necessary, be refocused to ensure that they do just that. It is vital that the Employment Pact should consolidate the key role of the Luxembourg process. What is important now is to strengthen the employment guidelines so that they deliver their full potential as a powerful instrument for labour market reform. We have the right to expect that the national action plans presently being drafted by the Member States will be more ambitious than last year. And as we come to evaluate the impact of the national action plans later this year, two years after Luxembourg, we will be in a better position to assess whether the strategy is working or whether more effort is required in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to stress that the European Social Fund must play a key role in support of the European employment strategy. We understand therefore very well why the draft resolution suggests a return to the Commission's proposal for the funding of Objective 3 activities in 2000‐2006. However, we cannot forget the broader budgetary context. We are not unhappy with the way in which the European Social Fund and the employment strategy have been treated in the Berlin settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to your discussion on the link between the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines. In Vienna the European Council called for greater synergy between the two processes and the Commission responded to this request with its latest broad economic policy guidelines and its Article 127 communication. However, do not forget that the Luxembourg process is still very new. The Member States have created new working arrangements to implement their national action plans and to report on them. We are learning together to work a process of peer pressure and open evaluation. It should be allowed to gain momentum: a change in timetable at this early stage could be disruptive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that our approach to employment must cover macro‐economic, as well as micro‐economic, policies and must address problems which arise not just in labour markets but also in the product and capital markets. The creation of such a comprehensive approach and a dialogue between all the actors involved is the core of the proposed employment pact. These are issues of substance not timetabling. We hope the pact will be a step towards a better integration of macro‐economic, employment and structural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with two or three remarks on points which I found particularly interesting in the course of the debate. Several speakers – such as Mr Blokland and Mr Langen – drew attention to the ageing population problem. Under Commissioner Flynn's initiatives, the Commission has looked into the problem of the future of social security and, I am glad to say that, at the further and recent instigation of both the German presidency and the European Parliament, we will come forward very soon with a communication on pension funds, drawing the conclusions from the Green Paper exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers – including Mrs Randzio‐Plath, Mrs Boogerd‐Quaak and Mrs Van Lancker – touched upon the taxation aspects. Let me simply say that in spite of the inevitable difficulties due to the unanimity rule, it is undeniable that now, under the strong urging of the German presidency and with the support of this Parliament, progress is being made in the implementation of the strategy against harmful tax competition and a number of objectives have been set for the Helsinki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the more specific proposal, dear to many of you, about the reduced VAT rate on labour‐intensive services is concerned, I am glad to note that today under the German presidency the first meeting of a Council working group on this subject took place, and later this evening we shall be debating the Thyssen report on this very topic.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) Lastly, Mr Blot, I do not share your fear that fiscal coordination, following monetary union, might eliminate one of the two remaining options for implementing a policy against the famous asymmetric shocks. I think you can rest assured since the notion of fiscal harmonisation, as proposed by the Commission and unanimously adopted by the Ecofin Council and as supported, among others, by the rapporteur, Mr Fourçans, is certainly not an advanced notion of harmonisation. I would instead call on you to consider the problem in the following terms: if there were no coordination of fiscal policies, given the present level of market integration, the Member States would increasingly lose their sovereignty to anonymous markets and they would therefore have less and less opportunities to implement an effective fiscal policy.</span></p>

I should like to remind you that this recommendation on the policy mix defends a balance of budgetary policy, wage increases and structural policy. With regard to monetary policy, if this year"s presentation seems different compared to last year"s, it is due to the fact that, unlike last year, we now have an independent European Central Bank and the Commission does not think it appropriate to interfere in this principle of independence. Having said that, the Commission reserves the right, both this year and next, to carry out all the analyses and make all the comments it deems necessary to guarantee that the policy mix is as balanced and relevant as possible in order to ensure sustainable growth that does not cause inflation and that creates jobs in Europe.</p>
