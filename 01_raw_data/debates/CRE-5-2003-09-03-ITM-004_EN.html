<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our commitment to Europe has as its goal an active, democratic and transparent European Union, one that is founded on values, principles and rules. This proposal for a European constitution sees us taking a decisive step closer to that goal, and it is a great joy to be able to welcome President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, a former member of our group, to this House as President of the Convention. I do not want to repeat what the Liberals have had to say on the subject. President Giscard, I have a clear recollection of how, in January 1992, when Egon Klepsch, the chairman of our group, was elected President of the European Parliament, I stood behind you as we together – you first, with me following modestly behind – cast our votes for Leo Tindemans as group chairman. If, back in 1992, somebody had said that Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would, in September 2003, put before the European Parliament a constitutional treaty, a constitution for Europe, I would have said that was wonderful, that it was a dream, a vision! That this dream has become reality is something in which we can rejoice with all our hearts.</p>
<p class="contents">To you, President Giscard d’Estaing, I want to address a special word of gratitude and appreciation. I might add that I have never doubted that the outcome would be a good one, for you met in our group’s chamber, although I will readily concede that it was once home to another group. I would also like to express warm thanks to our members of the Praesidium, Mr Iñigo Méndez de Vigo, Mr Klaus Hänsch, and, representing all our Members in the Convention, their chairman, Mr Elmar Brok, and our colleagues in the Convention. You will all have the opportunity to take the floor at our second September sitting, when we will be discussing the reports by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos. The Convention’s methodology has turned out to be the right one, as, post-Nice, we had said in the presence of the President of the European Council that we needed another methodology, and our group has always put the case for a Convention. It is no secret that, within our group, which is a large one, the PPE component has priorities that differ from those of the DE element, which is made up of our British friends, but what I can say, on behalf of our group as a whole, is that it is the allocation of competences within Europe that is vital. Our goal is an active Europe, not a centralist Europe. Where common action by Europeans is called for, Europe must be able to act. Not everything that calls for action in Europe calls for action by Europe, but, where Europe is required to act, Europe must be strong. We are now defining what the areas for European action are. It is now for the nation states to say where they have to act, what are the regions’ areas for action, and where action has to be by the municipalities. It is very much to be welcomed that this constitutional treaty guarantees the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and the right of appeal for all national parliaments, and that there is an elaborate network of balances interconnecting the different levels of the European Union. We especially welcome the way in which a place has also been found in the constitution for local self-government.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know the exact percentage, but Parliament will have equal rights of codecision on over 90% of legislation, and transparency is at last introduced into the Council of Ministers, which must no longer legislate behind closed doors. It is on the basis of the elections to the European Parliament that the President of the Commission must be nominated. Even now, I call upon the Heads of State or Government to take into account the results of the 2004 European parliamentary elections – no matter what the result; my concern is with the principle – when nominating the President of the Commission, even if the constitution is not yet in force by the time the elections are held.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have, as a group, seen it as very important that the Foreign Minister, too, should be subject to approval by vote of the European Parliament. We have not, of course, got everything we wanted, nor could we have done. We would have liked the constitution to incorporate a reference to our Judaeo-Christian heritage. We would have liked decisions in foreign and security policy to be based on the principle of majority voting, and we are well aware of the difficulties involved in working out the votes in the Council. I believe that most of us will agree with me when I warn, in the strongest terms, against now undoing this elaborate compromise. Mr Fini, Mr Frattini, we want the European Parliament to have representatives – I am deliberately avoiding the term ‘observers’ – at the Intergovernmental Conference, who will have every facility afforded them to play their part in its work. That is what I have to ask of you.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that the project on the table before us is a great one. At this Intergovernmental Conference, great responsibilities will rest upon your shoulders. There are vast opportunities involved, but also immense dangers, and, on behalf of all of us, I wish you every success, for what this is about is our having, in the twenty-first century, a legal basis on which to peacefully resolve the differences and conflicts of interest that we in Europe have, so that peace may be secured by law, and I wish you great success at the Intergovernmental Conference!</p>

You were one of the creators of the European Council. You worked for the direct election of the European Parliament. You even gave the name ‘<span class="italic">écu</span>’ to the future European currency. Obviously, the name has changed.</p>
<p class="contents">You were right to choose the tortoise, representing perseverance, as a symbol during the Convention. I had the opportunity to work with you as a Member of the European Parliament, notably when, as an initial experiment, the governments and the Council were opened up as an integral part of the preparatory interinstitutional conference that we set up and that anticipated the Convention before the term existed. Our group thinks that you have done some good work as President of the Convention. Having a tortoise made of jade was felicitous. If it had been a flesh and blood one, you would have been sorry to see it disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not now going to analyse the work of the Convention, something we shall do in the course of the second September part-session on the basis of the Tsatsos report. Allow me to comment on your quotation from Montesquieu. Indeed, the great historic originality of our work is to devise a democratic structure that goes beyond the nation state in the era of globalisation. Montesquieu is, to be sure, a philosopher who talked about democracy and the nation state. Now, let us not forget that Montesquieu began by writing about the grandeur and decadence of the Rome to which we are now returning.</p>
<p class="contents">I also salute the fact that you began the draft constitution with a quotation from Pericles’ funeral oration. Indeed, all Europeans, both men and women, could identify with this speech made 2 500 years ago. It shows that we have made our contribution to history, on the pattern laid down by Montesquieu. The Constitution has served Parliament, in its capacity as a legislative power, best, according it its central statute.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the reservations expressed about the fact that essential areas are still subject to the unanimity rule. Where the executive is concerned, I think that it made sense to have divided the Council into a legislative council and an executive council, but that the solutions proposed at the end of the Convention are not as satisfactory. I concur with a number of the criticisms made by my colleague, Mr Hänsch, concerning the President of the Commission, and I am also in favour of more flexible solutions for revising the Constitution, given the historic situation we are in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, especially, that the spirit of the Convention was already present at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference. Otherwise, I should be at a loss to explain why so many foreign ministers actively participated in the Convention.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> If I may, Mr President, I will end my speech by addressing Mr Fini and Mr Frattini in Italian.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister, you said something which I believe to be important: you said that you are going to invite the European Parliament to take part in the Intergovernmental Conference. This, however, needs to be done without delay, for the IGC starts in a month’s time. It is not enough just to make an announcement of this kind. Moreover, you added that you intend to invite Mr Giscard d’Estaing and the Vice-Chairmen. In my opinion, Mr Giscard d’Estaing and the Vice-Chairmen must not be made redundant,<span class="bold"> </span>consigned to<span class="bold"> </span>technical<span class="bold"> </span>unemployment, for they can make a valuable contribution. In any case, I would point out that this is the first opportunity that the citizens, the people, have had to take part in the process of drafting the Constitution. Therefore, when we go to Rome, now, we must not set up a conclave behind closed doors, leaving the people outside to wait for the white smoke. This is not the democratic method that we Europeans want.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will therefore reiterate a proposal which I have already made many times and which was adopted by the European Parliament in July. I believe that this Intergovernmental Conference must be open. I will not say it must be transparent, for I believe that you have gone a little too far for that. As regards the role of the European Parliament, I would reiterate our proposal: the Conference president must report to Parliament on a monthly basis, and, in my view, Mr President, it would be extremely sensible to invite all the members of the Convention and the representatives of the national parliaments to attend meetings of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in order to ensure that, although the work of the Convention is now over, the spirit of the Convention and a more transparent working method can go hand in hand at the Intergovernmental Conference and a Constitution for all Europeans can be achieved.</p>

<p class="contents">My group and our Liberal caucus in the Convention endorse your draft European Constitution. We commend the Constitution despite its insufficiencies because it represents a considerable step forward for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The text before us is an endorsement of the Convention method as a way of reforming the European Union. A similar Convention should be set up if and when the time comes substantially to amend the Constitution. But to allow our citizens to understand the European Union, we must make a break from the era of changing the Treaties every five years in a Mao Zedong-style permanent revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Heads of State and Government prepare to inaugurate the Intergovernmental Conference on 4 October 2003, the message of the European Liberal Democrat group is this: stay true to the spirit of the Convention in your debates, and do not seek to re-open behind closed doors the difficult compromises which you agreed months ago. Where there are changes, be transparent, as urged by the Convention's President. Respect the contribution made by the European Parliament to drawing up this remarkable text by ensuring at least three representatives for Parliament at your working sessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is short for the work of the IGC to be concluded in good time for the European elections. Let us use this time to sell Europe's new Constitution to our citizens, rather than reopening at length the debate.</p>

Then, my group will emphasise what it considers to be positive advances: new parliamentary prerogatives, a willingness to encourage ordinary people to get involved, and certain elements of transparency. It will also express views on other, much more controversial institutional aspects and explain why it is making the case for ratification through referendums. Today, I am going, however, to tackle a more global problem and ask a sort of preliminary question.</p>
<p class="contents">A constitution is, in principle, a fundamental law determining a country’s form of government. It is also able to lay down a number of benchmark values and fundamental rights. In no circumstances can it aspire to restrict for thirty to fifty years – for that is the lifespan of this document, as promised by President Giscard d'Estaing – the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own model of society. Democracy means choice. Now, what we have before us, in addition to reform of the institutional system, is a process whereby the model of a liberal Europe is given constitutional status.</p>
<p class="contents">We thus learn from as early on as Article 3, and I quote, that ‘[t]he Union shall offer its citizens … a single market where competition is free and undistorted’. On four occasions, there subsequently recurs the liberal theme of an open market economy characterised by free competition. It is, however, precisely against this obsession with all-out competition and against this inclination to reduce the whole of life in society to the level of a commodity that a growing number of our fellow citizens are protesting and mobilising. A factor further to the discredit of the Praesidium of the Convention is the fact that most of the provisions setting up the model of a liberal Europe as inviolable appear in the third part of the document. Unbeknown to most people outside this House, the 340 articles comprising this part – in other words, three quarters of the entire draft Constitution – have not been subject to any discussion within the Convention during the 16 months of work, the results of which were presented to the Thessaloniki European Council. It has to be said that they were added on the quiet and after the event, right in the middle of July so that the majority of editions of the Constitution in circulation quite simply ignore them. That is, as it were, the hidden face of the draft Constitution. It is, however, this part that defines, in particular, economic and monetary policy and the inordinate powers of a European Central Bank obsessed with price stability and the rise in salary costs. In other words, it is the most disputed content of the Treaty of Maastricht that you have thus taken up and perpetuated.</p>
<p class="contents">These articles also list the drastic restrictions placed upon social policy, as well as upon the conception of public services, tolerated in terms of mere, and I quote, ‘reimbursement for the discharge of certain obligations’ and as departures from the rules of competition and from the provisions prohibiting state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Deeply convinced as I am that, now as never before, there is a European need for hope in transforming the world, I think it would be very damaging to provoke, in this way, many anti-liberals into becoming anti-Europeans. That is why I would ask you this question, President Giscard d'Estaing: might nothing therefore change concerning future trends in the European Union, whatever the political developments in one or other European country? Is that not a legitimate question? It is valid in terms of the economic and social dimensions of this project, as well as in terms of its political dimension, since Article 40, for example, foresees the common security and defence policy being, and I quote, ‘compatible with the … policy established within [the] framework [of NATO].’ Is NATO to be a constituent part of European identity? We can, emphatically, do better in terms of European ambition, the rehabilitation of politics and the promotion of responsibility on the part of individual citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As you very rightly stated, never forget the citizens, Mr Giscard d'Estaing. I await your reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the text adopted by the Convention indisputably represents a step forward for European democracy. Many of our demands have been complied with: the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the improvement of the legislative process, including the introduction of the citizens’ right of legislative initiative; the inclusion among the Union’s goals of a number of aims, and we will fight and enlist the citizens’ support to see them achieved; full employment, fair trade, pluralism, the protection of human rights, conflict prevention, the sustainable development of the earth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thanks to results such as these that we can now claim this text as our own too and undertake to defend it in the coming months. Clearly, however, for us, this European constitutional process is not yet finished. We do not share the opinion of those who believe that this was the best that the Convention could do. In particular, it failed to bring instruments and policies into line with its most innovative objectives, it preserved the unanimity requirement and it further increased the Council’s supremacy in key areas of the Union’s competences.</p>
<p class="contents">While we acknowledge the high quality of its work, we feel that the way in which the Praesidium and you, yourself, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, conducted the Convention’s work, the rules chosen to govern the process, must be carefully assessed and analysed, for they have had a definite effect on the quality of the text adopted. It was a serious strategic error to agree right from the beginning to the Convention being polluted by the very intergovernmental method that it was trying to leave behind. Clearly, this shifted the emphasis of the debate from what the Union should do and how to who wins and who loses under the new rules, which is typical of an Intergovernmental Conference and the basic cause of the regrettable failure of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two practical proposals for the future: the Chairman of the Convention must be elected by the Convention itself and its work must be conducted more explicitly according to the Parliamentary method, which, although based on the search for consensus, is also based on the rule of majority voting. We have two extremely important challenges ahead, the first of which is certainly to prevent the positive results achieved by the Convention being nullified during the Intergovernmental Conference by the endeavours of those same governments which were opposed to the Convention and now want to challenge its work. That would be unacceptable and, I would venture to say, unlawful. Over and above the provisions of the Treaties, it is clear that the most important innovation of the Convention has been to take away the governments’ monopoly on reform of the Union. It is unthinkable that we should have to go back on this achievement, and it is not acceptable that essential parts of the text should be amended without the explicit agreement of Parliament, at least: this is clearly quite different from merely inviting a couple of observers to the meetings. In this sense, it would appear to be particularly important to highlight Mr Giscard d’Estaing’s proposal to make the different phases of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference completely transparent and public.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, it is absolutely essential to abolish the unanimity requirement for revision of the Constitution and to introduce power of ratification for the European Parliament. If it is not possible to do this, if the unanimity safety mechanism is preserved, it is not difficult to predict what will happen in the future: the Union will be unable to move forward, unable to act, and, in the long term, it will become increasingly insignificant and divided.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual historic import of the Convention’s work will depend, not least, on the Italian Presidency. Mr Fini, Mr Frattini, you must defend the text adopted by the Convention from some of your impetuous colleagues. You must be open to improvements and endeavour to make it a text that can be developed and changed. In this you will have our full support.</p>

It is simply that I have a limited amount of time in which to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like first of all to say that no midwife, be it in the field of obstetrics or politics, has the ability to get rid of congenital deformities. Whatever the intellectual virtues of the Convention and of its President and of those of our eminent fellow MEPs who have taken part in this work – most notably the vice-presidents of my group, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Queiró – it was certainly very naïve to believe, or to lead others to believe, that a European Constitution might in itself permit the transformation of a technocratic European structure into a democratic political body.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agrees in thinking of the European Union as a democracy. If there is in fact to be a constitution, it can, therefore, only proceed from the constituent power, that is to say the sovereign people, and it can only be ratified by that same sovereign people. Now, where is the constituent power? No one in this Convention has been given the slightest popular mandate to devise a constitution, and I am also surprised to hear members of the Convention, including the most eminent among them, say that no modification whatsoever to the document that has been drawn up would be acceptable, either at the Intergovernmental Conference or, even, at European Council level. That is an outrageous claim.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance in principle of a constitutional document, I would add that only a referendum would be able to legalise this great institutional change in the EU. What referendum, however? Of necessity, a European referendum, that is to say a consultation organised on the same day in each Member State. Apart from the fact that the referendum procedure is not anticipated in all the Member States, how, in any case, would the outcome be assessed? At European level as a whole? At national level? In that case, what would happen if the majority of people in a single Member State voted ‘no’? No satisfactory answer has been given to any of these questions. A political impasse has been reached, since the two questions upon which success depends have not been asked. How is the power of the populations to approve or reject the stages of this construction to be preserved? Moreover, do the peoples of Europe want to construct an independent Europe capable of influencing the balance of world power?</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to say to you on behalf of a group united in its diversity. Let us, therefore, keep our feet on the ground and stick with the principles forming the basis of genuine European integration: the peoples and the nations.</p>

Sadly, that was not the case when it came to devising this would-be European Constitution which amounts in practice to what is, so far, a friendly game of musical chairs between old and new, small and large countries and within and between the European institutions themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">There were, however, Mr President, many revolutions we could have engaged in. We could have effected an economic and social revolution, overturning what President Prodi called the stupid dogmas, established in Maastricht and reinforced in Amsterdam, that, increasingly with every day that passes, manifestly condemn Europe and, in particular, the euro zone to deflation and unemployment. We could have effected a political revolution by declaring our independence, affirming our vision of a multipolar world and defending the central role of the United Nations in world affairs. We could even have effected a cultural revolution by establishing, in opposition to the commercial organisation of the world, the right of peoples freely to choose their way of life and their own allegiances. We might, above all, have effected a democratic revolution by turning Europe into an extension of our national democracies, instead of arranging the latter’s demise, and by creating a genuine political space peculiar to Europe through the Congress you proposed and by having recourse to a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do this, however, we ought no doubt to have been inspired more by Rousseau than by Montesquieu. Everyone knows that you chose a tortoise as a symbol, no doubt, of punctiliousness and perseverance, but not really of revolution. That is a pity.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I doubt if the peoples and citizens of Europe – they amount, moreover, to more or less the same thing – would identify with this Constitution that there is a desire to impose upon them. It remains to be seen, moreover, who will be courageous enough to organise a referendum. I should like to add a small PS for the attention of the Intergovernmental Conference: ‘Do not abandon Strasbourg’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the working party’s report on legal personality was presented, you asked: ‘To what exactly would you accord legal personality? To a state or to an international organisation?’ It was an excellent question, but an inconvenient one. The Convention never replied, preferring not to commit itself. If, however, it was possible to say at the start that European integration had a character all of its own and that it was a question of a non-identified legal object, the object would now appear more and more easily identifiable as the treaties have come and gone and, above all, at the conclusion of the Convention. In essence, it takes the form of a state, of a central and supranational decision-making power with its unique institutional framework, its law superseding the national constitutions, its common law majority decision-making procedure and even, now, its Constitution with its constitutional super-court. Perhaps a number of these elements – in certain lights and considered in isolation – may suggest an international organisation. They all obviously combine, however, to form the outline of a European state, given the strength, intensity and broad sweep with which they are being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like, in my turn, to ask you a question: do you think that this European superstate really is what our peoples want? You who quoted surveys to us just now should know that the answer is ‘no’. Our peoples certainly want to see European cooperation. They even want to see more policies with cross-border implications dealt with at European level. At the same time, however, they want their countries to retain their freedom to take decisions and the freedom to choose their national democracy, the only form of democracy in the full sense of the word to date.</p>
<p class="contents">In these conditions, do you not think that the European superstate is a very poor response to a good question? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially at risk is the <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause to qualified majority voting and the provisions on security and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">A single package forged through consensus was the optimum solution possible at the present phase of integration. If the compromise is unpicked something distinctly sub-optimal will result. Nice II will be much worse than Constitution I. If the IGC were to begin to unpick the Convention's proposal it would also subvert the very concept of the Convention itself, which is a major breakthrough for constitutional law and parliamentary democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The IGC can focus its work where we failed to achieve a consensus – especially regarding Part IV. I agree with Mr Prodi that it is essential that we have softer revision procedures where a shift in competences is not involved. We also require a sensible plan should the entry-into-force provisions be frustrated by accident or by design.</p>
<p class="contents">In Part III several policy chapters – notably the common agricultural policy – can and should be polished and refurbished. All this is possible if the transparent and pluralistic spirit of the Convention is carried forward to the IGC. I know that this Parliament stands ready to play its full part.</p>

Do not therefore accuse me subsequently of not expanding upon matters sufficiently. Consider, rather, that it is a gesture of courtesy in view of the work done by your House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fini, I should like to thank you for two things: first of all, your contribution to the work of the Convention, because you have been very much involved. You are Vice-President of your government, you came to all the sessions, you remained in your seat, you listened, you took your turn to speak and you were – together with others, of course – a model participant in the Convention. I would also thank you for having given your approval – on behalf, of course, of the Italian Presidency – to the project as a whole and for having emphasised that it was indeed a coherent project. That is a crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, we have just heard – and I shall return to this matter – proposals for partial changes. The disadvantage of these partial changes, however, is that they disturb a balance that we have meticulously constructed together, with a view to ensuring that the project has a cohesion – to use your own expression – that must not be distorted. Hence, balance must remain the reference point.</p>
<p class="contents">You have approved the idea – taken up by a number of members of the Convention, notably by your compatriot – of work that is open and transparent. I hope that, in regard to the press and public opinion – and I am replying here to Mr Pasqua – this constitutional debate will indeed be an open one. What I would ask you is, not to dismantle things, not to disappoint and, at the same time, not to be content to adopt a negative attitude, because that is naturally not enough. Rather, it is necessary to take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">The great moments of political excitement are those of progress rather than of disintegration. At the last session of our Convention, moreover – rather curiously, because no explosion of political emotion was expected – those from a variety of political backgrounds present on all the benches had come together because of the feeling there was that perhaps the new unified Europe had an opportunity to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Frattini, you will of course have a lot of technical work to do at this Intergovernmental Conference. I believe that your three principles are sound. Stick, therefore, to your three principles: respect for the timetable and respect for what you have very properly called the store of wisdom accumulated by the Convention, namely the major legacy of our 1 800 speeches. It is necessary to make use of these, and the task is therefore one of improving and supplementing. Improving, yes; supplementing, yes; putting a question mark over, emphatically no.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, we have had debates. I came to visit you, on my own initiative moreover, in Brussels when our work was almost complete in order to take note of your personal reactions to what our document contained. You stated that this compromise was incomplete. We shall see what will be added because, if it is cut drastically, this compromise will be still more incomplete. You are yourselves parliamentarians from all the Member States, old and new. Now, it has to be emphasised that the fact that the Convention reached a compromise, with just six dissenters, signified that the compromise was almost complete.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the issue of qualified majority voting. First of all, whenever, throughout the work of the Convention, qualified majority voting was demanded, I would ask what type of qualified majority was meant. This point has not been raised. Now, there are in fact two systems of qualified majority voting. There is the Nice system, based on a scale, and there is the draft Constitution system, based on a double majority: a majority of the Member States and a majority of the represented population, which we have set at 60%. It has to be specified, therefore, what type of qualified majority is being talked about.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told we should have gone further in the difficult debate on the number of questions that are to be subject to qualified majority voting. In fact, we have doubled the number, and we have not in fact been able to adopt the universal rule because of obstacles that were insurmountable for one group or another.</p>
<p class="contents">I would cite the case of taxation. Six states participating in the Convention were making taxation an insurmountable obstacle. We debated with them. I visited London twice in order to see the British Prime Minister. We talked about the matter with our other colleagues, since, as you know, other Member States had major reservations about the tax issue. I hoped right until the end that we might introduce qualified majority voting for market taxation, since the latter is very much linked to the operation of the single market. In the end, we were able to make a certain degree of progress, since we provided for qualified majority voting in the cases of administrative cooperation and the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. We were not able to go any further on the basis of consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, we shall see if any further progress is made on the basis of unanimity. I should like to remind you of a central innovation that has been little talked about: the content of our article on the transition from unanimity to qualified majority voting. This point is very important because we have put in place an arrangement that, over time, will permit the transition to qualified majority voting. I would refer you to Article 24(3), enabling us to do in the future – and I also say this with Mr Barón Crespo in mind – what we have tried to do as much as possible in the Constitution: the European Council will be able to decide unanimously, as specified by the Treaty, to transfer a certain number of framework or European laws to the sphere of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, what you are seeking to obtain by negotiation, the European Council will be able to achieve through the exercise of its powers in application of Article 24, paragraphs 4 and 5. I am not talking about the composition of the Commission. I would simply say to you, Mr Prodi, that I have here the amendments that have been lodged. The Convention is familiar with the proposals you have made just now. They were the subject of debates within the Convention. Moreover, the new Member States that, at the beginning, were understandably very keen that there should be as many Commissioners as Member States – leading to figures bearing no relation to the number of responsibilities to be exercised by the Commission – have accepted, as we proposed, that the reform should only apply as from 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, all the new countries will have Commissioners for the period 2005-2009. They will be equally well placed when it comes to constituting a genuine European college whose composition will reflect the number of tasks to be exercised by the Commission and the number that, as President Jacques Delors said, will enable it to retain its collegiate character.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you talked about natural disasters. On the initiative of a working party chaired by Commissioner Barnier, Article 42 introduces into the Constitution the opportunity of exercising European solidarity in relation to natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a word on the problem of the revision procedure, taken up by other speakers. A number of members of the Convention – even a large number of them – would have liked it to have been possible to deal with this subject, because the revision procedure is going to remain that laid down by the treaties. Now, it is obvious that, within the framework of a Constitution, there is some sort of internal revision procedure that bypasses the general circuit of treaties and of the twenty-five or twenty-seven ratifications.</p>
<p class="contents">We had no mandate for dealing with this subject, but the problem remains unresolved, and I have a sense that, in the years to come – perhaps not within the next 30 years, but certainly in the years to come – the question of a possible future constitutional revision procedure will have to be addressed. In Europe’s current political state, I believe it would be unrealistic to imagine that the views of the Member States might be ignored. A time will come, however, when, just as the transition has been made from unanimity to qualified majority voting, a new procedure will be required in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to MEPs’ speeches. I would thank Mr Méndez de Vigo both for his work within the Convention and for his vision of the role he wishes to see the European Parliament play, a role indeed that the Convention will not be able to perform but that Parliament is in a position to assume.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall turn to you, Mr Hänsch, last. I would say to Mr Poettering that he is from a country that has contributed a lot to music. Whenever there is a concert – I had the opportunity in Brussels, during the Convention, of hearing the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra – the conductor of the orchestra asks for applause for the musicians. He asks the musicians to stand so that the audience might applaud them. That is why I would thank you for the compliments you have paid me, but I should like to share them with the members of the Convention. The document with which I am presenting you today is a collective, rather than individual, work. It is the fruit of a joint effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been diligent, Mr Poettering, in dealing with the issues of competences, of the stability of competences and of the monitoring of subsidiarity. The request that this issue be dealt with was particularly strong in those EU countries that have federal structures. It was therefore given particular prominence by the German members of the Convention and also by our Spanish partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo, who speaks all the languages of the EU – a factor that obviously simplifies the debates – was right in saying that ours is a first attempt at democratic construction going beyond the nation state. It is therefore an original structure, and those who say it would be enough to copy the institutions of the nation state are mistaken because the nation state model would not enable us to deal with the problem of the double legitimacy of the Member States and of the populations.</p>
<p class="contents">You wanted to see an open IGC, or Intergovernmental Conference. I believe that everyone here, particularly the representatives of the Presidency, concur in wishing to respond favourably to your wish.</p>
<p class="contents">By a twist of fate, Mr Watson is seated beside Mr Poettering. My experience enables me to share both their cultures, and I thank Mr Watson for the contribution of his group, which included several influential members of the Convention, among them, incidentally, Mr Duff who has been one of the people most active in carrying our work forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz, your quotations from our document were chosen specifically in order to show that, as you said, the document in a way constitutionalises the liberal economic system in Europe. Now, if you take Article 3 on the objectives of the EU, which we have debated at length, what do we read? We read first of all that the EU is an area of freedom for people, an area of freedom in the economic sense of the term with, indeed, the four freedoms laid down by the basic treaties. We would, however, add to the objectives of the EU a social market economy, highly competitive and aiming at full employment and social progress. We foresee the EU combating social exclusion and discrimination, promoting equality between women and men – which is a crucial point in our documents – and protecting the rights of children. Alongside economic freedom, which is a spatial freedom, the Constitution therefore carefully describes social objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about articles on EU policy and say that some of these are secret. They are not secret, but they have to be translated. At the end of the month, we shall present all of our documents translated into the EU’s future 22 languages. That is the explanation for the fact that we have not been able to forward them very quickly. Whatever the case, the articles in question have not been modified. These are the articles from the treaties, since we had no mandate to modify them other than to take account of the changes: a new institutional system, changes of name, European laws, framework laws, voting procedures and the legal base for policies. The actual description of the policies is, however, unchanged except where four of them are concerned: policy relating to economic and social governance, on which considerable progress has been made, even if more might have been wished for; common external policy; common defence policy; and policy relating to security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Frassoni, whom I had met in the course of our debates in the Convention, talks about intergovernmental methods. We have done away with this term, which goes back to the beginning of the Convention. On the contrary, we wanted to revive the institutional triangle. There is no intergovernmental element. There are three institutions at work: Parliament, which expresses its opinion; the Commission, which proposes legislation and engages in administration; and the Council of Ministers, which takes the decisions entrusted to it by the Constitution. That is not an intergovernmental procedure. It is a case of Community decisions being taken by one of the bodies of the EU. You talk about having the President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament. You will see that, next time, matters will still take place in accordance with the Treaty of Nice, that is to say that you will do nothing other than give your approval. Your sole power will be that of giving your approval. With the Constitution, you would be able to vote in an election, and you could refuse the option proposed to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pasqua was wondering about the progression from technocratic structure to political body. We have tried to progress down that road as far as we could. He was wondering about our constituent power. Where, however, are the constituents? Mr Pasqua, how was the constitutional committee composed that, during the summer of 1958, drafted the constitution of the Fifth Republic? It was composed of named people. What is important in the constituent procedure is ratification. The constituent is whoever ratifies. In the event, the constituents will be, successively, the European Parliament, the referendums in all those countries able to have recourse to this procedure – as I hope France will – and the national parliaments in cases where this is required by constitutional procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish, then, by turning to Mr Abitbol, who expressed himself fully within the Convention. He was, therefore, able to observe that it was a place of free expression. He was in favour of the congress. So was I, so we have both failed. That being said, I believe that the question will arise again. The absence of a ‘European political constituency’ is a mistake. There needs to be an arena in which European politicians, both at European and national levels, can meet on an organised basis. President Barón Crespo must remember the conference that he organised in Rome and that was very fruitful for having been constructed on that model.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abitbol is a revolutionary of the kind that every assembly needs. He reproaches us for having devised the Constitution before having carried out the revolution. Certainly, the two methods exist, but we ourselves prefer to carry out a revolution under the law. Many of you will, I hope, take your places in the next European Parliament. If things happen the way we want them to, your debates will be with a stable President of the European Council who will have to come and provide you with an account of the activities of the EU following each European Council. You will have an EU Minister of Foreign Affairs to question and, when situations arise such as you have already experienced, there will be someone to whom you can put your questions about why one particular argument is to be defended and not another, or one action participated in and not another. It will therefore be a revolution under the law and, to use Mr Barón Crespo’s analogy, it will be a revolution à la Montesquieu, but on a continental scale.</p>
<p class="contents">My last reply is to Mr Hänsch. I much appreciated your contributions during the Convention because you defended neither particular interests nor lobbies. Rather, you were inspired by the common European good; and, although, on certain points, we did not always follow up your proposals because we were seeking balanced, compromise solutions, you have nonetheless inspired many of our advances, particularly in the area of social governance. You drew attention to the fact that, if the debates we have already had were re-opened, there would be no chance at all of reaching a balanced compromise. What would be the point of re-opening the debate in the case of each amendment already lodged and discussed, and either adopted in one form or another by the Convention or else ruled out by it?</p>
<p class="contents">You made this point in no uncertain terms, and I hope your voice will be heard because – and these are my final words, Mr President – in the present situation, which is one of knowing whether, in a few months’ time, Europe will or will not have a Constitution, there are in fact two approaches: either Europe does not provide itself with a Constitution and goes on forever re-opening the same debates, or else it does provide itself with a Constitution, aware that it will be necessary to live with it. That is why I do not want to see revolutionary fervour bursting forth from your Assembly but, rather, the momentum of a strong desire and a very great aspiration on the part of the peoples of Europe to make progress along the EU road.</p>

The swaggering of Mr Giscard d’Estaing and those behind him and the rejoicing of the then Greek Presidency and the current Italian Presidency do not suffice to refute the above reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Those promoting the anti-grass roots policy have the nerve to call by the name of 'constitution' a text which not only fails to crystallise the democratic achievements of the people, but also reduces them to a text which establishes capitalism constitutionally, which redistributes power for the benefit of the strong, which hands over more national sovereignty to the imperialist, Euro-unifying centre and which dangerously extends the militarisation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The result does not surprise us. It could not be otherwise, because it could not fail to reflect the nature of the ΕU and its current political situation. That is why the Communist Party of Greece is against the introduction of a European constitution, which strengthens the imperialist ΕU to the detriment of the people and for the benefit of the exploiters.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we surprised at the lack of substantial information on the content of the 'constitution'. Despite the propaganda campaign, the people must not be deceived. They must strengthen their fight to defend and extend their achievements, to demolish the structure being built by the exploiters and to finally change society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With more than 400 articles, progress is being made in the following areas: the classification of legal acts as European laws, framework laws or ‘delegated’ laws; and the creation of a Minister of Foreign Affairs and three Presidents – of the European Council, the Council of Ministers and the Commission – and of a whole orchestra of institutional instruments in which, although the conductor cannot be tracked down, it is easy to locate the big drum of the European Parliament which, once more, is gaining in volume without managing to gain in political credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">While making a lot of noise with its institutional ironmongery, the European Constitution still remains silent, however, on two subjects of major importance: on the one hand,</p>
<p class="contents">- the necessary protection of democracies crushed by the media power of empires ranging from Murdoch’s to Berlusconi’s; and on the other hand,</p>

This specious distinction implies that the States exist without reference to the will of their citizens. The reality, then, is that it is preparing a future alteration to the States’ democratic legitimacy and changes the nature of the EU, which has up until now been a union of states representing their peoples. An extremely pernicious bacillus has thus been introduced into the new ‘constitutional treaty’, which is itself founded upon a mythical being, the ‘European citizen’, reminiscent of the former ‘proletariat’, to which one can attribute whatever intentions one likes. Mr Giscard d'Estaing was doing no other when he declared that ‘European citizens’ were awaiting with extreme impatience a European constitution, a European foreign policy, a European minister of foreign affairs, and so on. Such a basis can be a hazardous one in all sorts of ways, all the more so in view of the character of the ‘new man’ that the ‘European citizen’ is, which is marked by oblivious barbarism, as demonstrated by the refusal of the members of the Convention to make reference in their text to the historic role played by the Christian faith in the real constitution of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
