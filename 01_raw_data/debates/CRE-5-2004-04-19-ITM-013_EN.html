<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for a new battery directive seeks to extend the scope of the existing Community legislation on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances to all batteries and accumulators placed on the Community market. Today the existing legislation covers only 7% of all the portable batteries sold each year in the European Union. This has hindered the setting up of efficient national collection and recycling schemes. Consumers have also been confused as to what is to be collected, and what not, and have therefore not participated effectively in the national collection schemes. Consequently, today many batteries still end up in the environment. In 2002, for example, approximately 45% of the total volume of portable batteries sold in the 15-member EU was landfilled or incinerated.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposal aims to achieve a high level of environmental protection while at the same time contributing to proper functioning of the internal market for batteries. In this respect the Commission's proposal has two main goals: creating a closed loop system for all batteries and accumulators, and introducing a producer responsibility scheme. The proposed closed loop system requires Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent final disposal of spent batteries and achieve a high level of battery collection and recycling. I am confident that the proposed collection targets for portable batteries, in combination with the proposed high recycling targets, will protect our environment against the risks involved in the disposal of those batteries. Moreover, the proposal addresses the issue of the uncontrolled disposal of hazardous batteries containing mercury, cadmium or lead. In this respect, in addition to the existing restrictions on the use of those substances, established by the end-of-life vehicles directive, the following additional measures would be introduced: a ban on landfilling and incineration of all industrial and automotive batteries, which covers most batteries containing lead or cadmium, and an additional collection target for portable nickel-cadmium batteries, which requires monitoring of the waste stream to determine the volume of discarded portable NiCad batteries. The extended impact assessment has identified the proposed policy options as the most sustainable from an economic, social and environmental viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the introduction of a producer responsibility scheme. The application of the producer responsibility principle is an important step towards incorporating the external environmental costs into the production phase and, at the same time, towards encouraging producers to market more environmentally friendly products.</p>
<p class="contents">All batteries and accumulators should be diverted from the waste stream and recycled in order to avoid environmental damage and recover the various metals they contain. To achieve this goal, we need to create a closed-loop system and make battery producers responsible for the products they make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the European Parliament’s emphatic insistence, there is at long last a proposal by the European Commission. A number of points of the Commission proposal can be seen in a positive light.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, all batteries fall within the scope of the directive. Secondly, there are binding collection targets. Thirdly, recycling percentages and recycling efficiencies are binding, and fourthly, producer responsibility plays a major role in the financing mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have held an extensive debate on batteries. More specifically, we discussed the avoidance of the use of heavy metals and collection targets. Agreement has been reached with all groups on most points in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Even about the collection targets for batteries, we have reached a broadly supported compromise. Since the sales figures for batteries differ quite considerably from one Member State to another, certainly after 1 May, a decision has been made in favour of proposing a percentage of the sales as the collection target.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the avoidance of the use of heavy metals is concerned, developments have been underway for years. EU legislation now stipulates that the heavy metals mercury, lead and cadmium are prohibited in materials and parts of vehicles which are brought onto the market after 1 July 2003, as well as in new electrical and electronic appliances which are brought onto the market after 1 July 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The key problem involving batteries and accumulators is precisely the presence of mercury, lead and cadmium, which are heavy metals. On pages 9 to 12 of the explanatory note to the Commission’s proposal, the harmful environmental and health effects of mercury, cadmium and lead are clearly described. For that reason, most batteries containing mercury were already banned in 1998. The guiding principle underlying drafts of the Commission’s revised battery directive has always been a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries. Surprisingly, the present Commission proposal has not opted for a ban on these, but for a so-called closed-loop system for cadmium. However, there does not appear to be a closed-loop system since only 80% of portable nickel-cadmium batteries need to be collected. Consequently, 20% of portable nickel-cadmium batteries end up as landfill or in an incinerator. Since cadmium is a volatile metal, it will, in the case of waste incineration, inevitably end up in the atmosphere. That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has introduced a ban on mercury, cadmium and lead. In addition, we have included an extensive list with exceptions for cases in which no effective substitutes are available. This includes batteries for hearing aids, emergency lighting, industrial batteries, lead accumulators and cordless power tools. Although I personally do not think the last exception to be necessary, I have added it nonetheless in order to accommodate objections from a number of Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The substitute for nickel-cadmium batteries, namely nickel-metal-hydride batteries, operate at a temperature of -20° Celsius to +60° Celsius. As such, I can assume that these batteries can be used across the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to react to the comic strip of the European Portable Battery Association, in which it is suggested incorrectly that all kinds of applications would no longer be permitted if the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy were to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have an old – four and a half years old – mobile telephone. This old telephone contains a lithium-ion battery. I am almost certain that the batteries in all your mobile telephones are nickel-metal-hydride or lithium-ion. In short, if nickel-cadmium batteries are prohibited for these applications, there is no problem whatsoever. Another example from the comic strip is that of lead accumulators in cars, which are not prohibited in the directive on end-of-life vehicles. Neither are they prohibited in the framework of the battery directive, because, as you heard a moment ago, they are included in the list of exceptions. The same applies to button cells in hearing aids and watches, cordless power tools, emergency lighting and all industrial applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the European consumers’ organisation BEUC is in favour of a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries for consumer applications. Although, as you are aware, there are plenty of alternatives, I noticed that industry is, in principle, against a ban, to such an extent that they are opposed to it to this day, even though all the exceptions they required have been made. I take the view that such arguments should not play a role in the decision-making. I suspect there is a dangerous tactic behind this. In this respect, it is worthy of note that industry, which is so very much resistant to a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries, is promoting alternatives for these on their own websites. We should therefore also promote these alternatives, namely by excluding harmful heavy metals from batteries as much as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We even built a factory and I took out a number of patents, which have now expired. I therefore have no economic interests to register. I also have to admit that at the time we did not give much thought to what was to be done with the things later. I therefore believe we are right to be looking at how such batteries can be recycled.</p>
<p class="contents">I would advise you not to ban things, however, but to introduce alternatives more quickly, and such alternatives exist in theory. Small fuel cells may easily come on the market this year or next and they contain no heavy metals. They also come from the same firms as make nickel-cadmium batteries, at any rate many have experience with them, and that would be my recommendation, instead of rushing straight to a ban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact it is fair to say that the development of portable electric power, particularly rechargeable electric power, has revolutionised our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Each one of us is probably carrying two or three batteries – in our phones, in our watches, in our car key fobs and maybe there are even one or two heart pacemakers in this Chamber. Batteries have made a contribution to safety. Cordless power tools have made building sites much safer and often in the case of power failure we rely on batteries for back-up lighting or emergency power. Recently I was at a nuclear power station where they have a battery the size of a building which provides the back-up power in the event of a power cut.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal which is balanced and in proportion to the problem. In particular, I congratulate the Commission on the way it addresses the problem of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries like Belgium have successfully removed batteries from the waste stream. We should take care to look at the cost of this. In Belgium it costs at least twice as much to collect the batteries as the actual value of the batteries themselves. We need to have a market-led solution so that we do not find we are collecting things just for the sake of it.</p>
<p class="contents">As with most waste issues in my country, the United Kingdom's record is pathetic. When adopted, I hope that the targets set by the Commission will be met and we do not repeat the situation we had with old fridges when the directive gathered dust on the shelf until it was too late to implement it in time. I also hope that the UK government will correctly fund the local authorities which are charged with the task of collecting these batteries.</p>
<p class="contents">I support some of the amendments. In particular, my Group supports the move not to set recovery targets based on an arbitrary number of grams – 160 grams for every country. Such a one-size-fits-all policy would be bizarre in countries such as the Baltic States where the battery market is not even half of 160 grams. To set the recovery targets based on a percentage is a much more sensible approach.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my Group will not support the amendments to Article 4 with regard to the bans on heavy metal. Firstly, the alternatives are not developed in every single sector. In the case of power tools in particular the alternative batteries have not performed as well and we would see tools having a much shorter life and being thrown away sooner than at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the United Kingdom we have had a number of studies on pollution looking at landfill and incineration. Although we have cadmium in the environment, the source of cadmium from batteries is not significant. If we wanted to cut back we would need to look at fossil fuels, fertilisers and the metallurgical industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the timescale. Batteries which are sold now will not come into the waste stream for more than 16 years. Therefore the heavy metal ban does not solve the problem in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we want to make batteries environmentally friendly to use, and secondly we do not want them to make our waste problem worse than it is. This in fact means that we need a strategy that ensures that as few batteries as possible are landfilled, and secondly we must see to it that innovations are made in battery production.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore also support the Commission’s approach of including all batteries in the legislation and of ensuring there is producer responsibility in battery production. I also agree with the many compromises we have reached together with the aim of making the collection and recycling of batteries better organised so that our waste problem will actually be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a variety of opinions in the House about how to encourage innovation and avoid heavy metals. The important thing is that we send the signal that we want batteries that do not harm the environment, do not contain heavy metals and are easy to recycle. Parliament must send this signal clearly so that the battery industry will innovate. That can of course also be done using various deposit schemes, with a higher deposit charged on hazardous battery systems than on the others. In the end, however, the consumer must also play his part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lobbying has been intensive and persuasive over this issue. I must admit that my views on points of detail have changed many times, but I have come to the conclusion that, while backing a closed-loop recycling system for cadmium batteries in the medium term, we should be looking in the long term for the replacement of such batteries because of their toxicity. The many exemptions I shall be supporting show that I consider this approach to be a measured and balanced one.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be careful not to set a level of lead so low that it will effectively prohibit the use of batteries containing even trace elements of lead for important purposes, notably in hearing aids. I have no doubt that we will, in practice, be able to resolve these questions as we consider the legislation further.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch upon the issue of collection targets for portable batteries. I am deeply cynical about these. I have been lobbied by the British Local Government Association, which wants me to support proposals for much higher targets – this from an association representing local authorities that currently only collect 12% of household waste. It all seems ridiculous. As we know, Member States all too often agree to what should be legally-binding targets in the certain knowledge that the pathetically cumbersome enforcement procedures that the Commission has at its disposal will mean that they never actually have to meet those targets within anything like the timescales proposed. As I have been saying for the last five years, we have to find better ways of getting ministers who sign up to these agreements to keep to their word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the water framework directive, we, that is the Council, Parliament and Commission, have decided to impose a gradual ban on cadmium. Why do we not do the same here?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a closed-loop system, but the rapporteur has already pointed out that only 80% is being recovered, which means that 20% must be disappearing into the environment. The Commission proposal is flawed in another way, namely the extraction of cadmium – a tiny amount of it – from the waste stream, which is huge; that is an extremely inefficient way of working, and so it is better to work on a ban and introduce a few derogations later.</p>
<p class="contents">Lithium-ion and nickel-hydride batteries are already on the market. In future, fuel cells will become available too. The alternative is thus in place. What is more, the market share of the alternative is already growing. That is why it is very regrettable that the Commission has succumbed to the pressure from part of the industry. European politics should reward the pioneers in industry and not those lagging behind, as the Commission is doing. Unfortunately, rewarding those lagging behind is exactly what the Christian Democrats and the Commission are doing. I hope that the majority in this House will know better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is carcinogenic and can cause serious damage to the nervous system. It also bioaccumulates, which means that it stays in the body and builds up over time. High exposure can cause severe lung, prostate and kidney cancer. The use of cadmium should therefore be banned. At the very least a ban on cadmium in household batteries would help to reduce cadmium levels and promote the use of alternatives in batteries over time. These alternatives to cadmium are what we really need, and they already exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Cadmium pollution of the environment carries very high health and economic costs, including water purification costs. These costs – or more correctly these potential savings – must be taken into account when considering the cost of a ban on cadmium batteries. If one looks at the dangers of cadmium one realises that we must seek out alternatives. There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban. In the long run this is the right approach to take for the sake of public health, consumer protection and the environment. The propaganda we have heard, which is completely simplistic and totally inaccurate, does nothing to help the debate, wastes the money of those who are trying to promote the opposite approach, and will not work. I hope that the Members of this Parliament will not be swayed by this simplistic rubbish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will limit myself to commenting on two issues that have been raised during the debate and explain once more why the Commission did not propose a ban.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission carried out an extended impact assessment in preparing this proposal. It has assessed the sustainability of different policy options, including a substance ban. It is important to recall that in this proposal the Commission has maintained a general restriction on the use of mercury in batteries, in line with the existing Battery Directive. The restrictions in the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive also continue to apply, so the provisions are there.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the basis of this impact assessment, a substance ban for other batteries was not chosen for the following reasons: a substance ban can only be considered if viable substitutes exist. At the moment, these substitutes do not exist for all applications. A ban would always be limited in scope and would never be able to cover all hazardous batteries. As we have already heard, a substance ban might not cover cordless power tools, emergency lighting and industrial applications. In fact, a ban would only represent around 16% of the total nickel cadmium battery market and less than 6% of the total lead battery market.</p>
<p class="contents">A large percentage of these hazardous batteries are currently in use or stored at home. It is estimated that 60% of rechargeable portable batteries are 'hoarded' or stored at home. They would not be covered by the ban and would still risk ending up in the environment. For cadmium batteries, the substitutes have a shorter lifespan and are more expensive, so that would create more waste and extra costs for consumers. These are the main arguments as to why we chose a closed-loop solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed this closed-loop system for all batteries. That should ensure that batteries no longer end up in the waste stream but are collected and recycled instead. For industrial NiCad batteries the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the proposed ban on landfill and incineration.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are our main arguments. I suppose that this will be debated from now on, but we all seem to agree that it is important to monitor what is going on and find the best solution to make sure that these hazardous substances and batteries do not end up in the waste stream. They must be taken care of.</p>
