This is a shocking incident because we have lost a friend, we have lost a European ally, we have lost someone who was fighting for democracy and stability in the region, the region of south-eastern Europe and the Balkans. I should like to convey my personal condolences to his family, his wife and children and, of course, the Serbian nation as a whole. We share their pain. Τhis tragic incident today has not only shocked us, it has reminded us that we, the European Union, remain committed to efforts to bring about stability, efforts to bring about peace and efforts to bring about progress in this region of Europe, a region which has been through hard times over recent years, with endless upheavals and ethnic conflicts, a region in which democracy has taken root in every country but is still in its infancy, a region in which, thanks to cooperation between the European Union, the international community, the UN, the United States, Russia and numerous others, spearheaded by Europe, we have managed to set stability and development in motion. However, this incident shows that we still have a long way to go. As President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to point out that the operation we are discussing in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia highlights our role in and our commitment to this region, our commitment to helping this region move towards Europe and, above all, our commitment to stability and peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">This operation is important on several counts. First, it will help to pave the way for long-term security and stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the inviolability of its internationally recognised borders. Secondly, this operation will help enhance the role and profile of the European Union in this country. It will, if you like, reinforce this country’s progress towards European integration within the context of the Stabilisation and Association Process. It will facilitate the application of the framework agreement. Thirdly, it will be the first practical test of the European military crisis management mechanism and the second step, following the policing mission in Bosnia, in putting the European Union’s operational capability into practice. Consequently, preparations and the operation itself need to be completed with the utmost care. Our credibility, the credibility of the European Union, hangs in the balance. Fourthly, this is the first practical application of cooperation between the European Union and NATO in the crisis management sector and implementation of the related permanent arrangements, which we expect to be completed very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has taken over this operation subject to two basic preconditions. First, permanent arrangements between the European Union and NATO must be completed and concluded and, secondly, a request must be submitted by the official authorities in the country in question.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first precondition is concerned, permanent arrangements are nearing completion. Almost all the relevant draft texts have already been agreed by ΝΑΤΟ and transmitted to the European Union. We shall make any comments or observations needed on our part and expect to have the texts ready for signing by the two organisations very shortly, in all events before the month is out.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the second precondition is concerned, we already have an official request from the government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia asking the European Union to take over this mission and all the parties involved have welcomed the initiative in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Presidency has included the takeover of this mission in its basic priorities in the ESDP area and is therefore making every effort along these lines. We should also point out that our taking over this specific mission and possibly other missions in the Balkans, such as the SForce operation in Bosnia, does not mean that the involvement and presence of ΝΑΤΟ and/or the United States has come to an end. On the contrary, we shall continue to work in close cooperation and we need to make it clear to all sides that this cooperation is continuing and that we shall be working together for the stability and security of the region. Similarly, as we shall be taking over from ΝΑΤΟ, rather than starting a new operation, we shall need to work closely with the alliance in order to ensure there is a seamless takeover and continuity. We shall, of course, need to take over within the specific permanent arrangements agreed, in order to safeguard the autonomy of both organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as progress is concerned in the light of what I have just said, I should like to comment briefly on the main milestones so far in preparing for this mission. The Council adopted the general idea of the operation on 23 January and the related joint action on 27 January. The institutional framework for the operation and, more importantly, the funding arrangements, are in place. The Political and Security Committee decided which third countries would be invited to participate on 4 February. They are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Iceland, Norway, Turkey and Canada. On 7 February, the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe was appointed as operation commander. It was decided that operational headquarters would be at SΗΑΡΕ. The French force commander was also appointed, given that France has been elected to act as framework nation. On the same day, the initial military guideline was issued to the operation commander. The operation commander has submitted a draft operational plan, including the rules of engagement administration and control structure and a statement of resource requirements, to the Military Committee. On 18 February, the Political and Security Committee therefore decided to set up a Contributions Committee. Finally, the conference to set up the force was held on 20 February and the conference to appoint the force staff was held on 25 February.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of outstanding issues have yet to be completed; the permanent European Union/ΝΑΤΟ arrangements I referred to earlier have to be officially concluded, especially the agreement needed in order to release the NATO assets and capabilities which will be supplied to the European Union so that it can carry out this mission, the operational plan has to be approved and adopted, staffing arrangements have to be completed, the operational budget has to be approved, an agreement has to be concluded with third participating countries, correspondence on the operation needs to be exchanged with the former Yugoslav Republic, an agreement on the status of the forces has to be concluded with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, exemption agreements between the Member States involved in the operation have to be concluded, correspondence needs to be exchanged with the OSCE about relations with its observers, ΝΑΤΟ has to pass a decision ending the ‘Allied Harmony’ operation and the Council has to pass a decision inaugurating the operation.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision will set the exact date on which the operation is taken over. It is expected to start officially before the end of the month, as soon as the outstanding issues I mentioned have been taken care of.</p>
<p class="contents">Before closing, I should like, if I may, to comment on the objective, duration, size of the force and command of the operation. The objective is to maintain the international military presence in order to prepare the ground for a stable security environment which will allow the government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to apply the Ohrid framework agreement. It is expected to last about six months. The end of the operation will depend on when the basic objective is achieved. The force numbers 487 men, including 212 staff positions. The structure and control of the operation are vital to the command of the operation. The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, Admiral Feist, who will head the European operation in the FYROM, recently reported on this in detail to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to bore you with the details; however, I would simply like to mention that it has been decided that the operation in FYROM will be carried out using NATO assets and capabilities; consequently, the planning will be as decided in Nice. The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe has been appointed as operation commander, and the European Union operational headquarters will be at SΗΑΡΕ.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned, the operational plan has already been drawn up and submitted to the Military Committee of the European Union, and SΗΑΡΕ and the Military Staff of the European Union are working in close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure optimum coordination of activities between the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ, and especially between the forces of the European Union in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and ΝΑΤΟ forces, which will mainly be stationed in Kosovo, a command base has been set up in the European Union, at the NATO base in Naples in Italy. As I said, France has been elected as the framework nation for the operation and will have the lead role in directing the operation. Brigadier-General Maral has therefore been appointed as force commander. However, ΝΑΤΟ will keep a supreme military representative at allied headquarters in Skopje and the two staffs will therefore work in close collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close this briefing on a note of optimism; I trust that, despite the difficulties, which were only to be expected, the European security and defence policy has now come of age. And now that it has come of age, the crisis management mechanism built up over the last four years can be implemented. This first operation is, I think, particularly important. We welcome this initiative on the part of the European Union, because the presidency was able to overcome obstacles to cooperation between the ESDP and NATO during the previous six months of the ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward both to the positive implementation of these decisions and to really being able to bring peace and stability to this region of south-eastern Europe, especially in the wake of incidents such as today’s tragic incident.</p>

I should like to extend my sympathy and, I am sure, the sympathy of the House to his family and friends and to all democrats in Serbia. Clearly we must not allow this assassination to set back the remarkable progress which has been made by Serbia in rejoining the European family, not least thanks to the bravery of men and women like Mr Djindjic. In about one and a half hours I am supposed to be flying to Croatia. This means I shall miss the end of the next debate, which will be left in the capable hands of Commissioner Bolkestein. Tomorrow evening I had planned to fly to Belgrade. Obviously, if it is still convenient for the authorities, I would like to do that and to express the solidarity of Parliament, the Commission and the Union as a whole with the government and people of Serbia in what is an extremely worrying time for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first European Union military operation is, as the Foreign Minister has said, about to start operations in the Balkans. It is an historic step for the European Security and Defence Policy. After the Copenhagen decisions we are now moving towards a wide-ranging set of arrangements with NATO – described by the Foreign Minister – which will enable our strategic partnership with them to go hand in hand with the entry into operation of the ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision taken by the Council in January to embark on a joint action opened a new chapter in the history of our integration, and it is not surprising that this chapter will have its first lines written in the Balkans. This historic dimension justifies fully the debate we are having today on the basis of the motion for a resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us remember the tragic events which took place in south-east Europe at the beginning of the nineties. Faced with a situation no one would have thought possible in our continent, the European Union had to develop new tools to strengthen its capacity to prevent and, if necessary, deal with any similar crises which could potentially endanger our security and which certainly offend our deepest values. It is therefore not by chance that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to be the setting for this new step forward by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The context of this operation is no longer the imperative to put an end to the civil conflict and to separate the fighters. It is rather the continuation of the build-up of a closer relationship between the Union and a country which is moving towards the European Union and which needs our support to consolidate the stability without which it will not be able to progress along this path.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like here to remind the House that only two years ago the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was on the edge of a civil conflict, but thankfully turned its back on war when an agreement was reached between the conflicting parties. During my first two years or so as a Commissioner I visited FYROM much more than any other place. In one period of just over a year I was in Macedonia almost ten times. A substantial and sustained commitment by the European Union – political as well as financial – supported the process. Thus we offered both a European perspective to the country through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through increased financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">A few figures can illustrate how substantial our financial assistance package has been. More than EUR 30 million was allocated in 2001 through the CARDS programme and the Rapid Reaction Mechanism, while nearly EUR 7 million was delivered in humanitarian assistance. These funds have been focused on de-mining, housing reconstruction, local infrastructure rehabilitation, confidence-building measures and institutional reforms required under the Framework Agreement. This effort was quickly followed up by the adoption of a multiannual programme which, under CARDS, earmarked EUR 130.5 million for democracy, the rule of law, justice and home affairs, and economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">These efforts have been paying off. The last few months have shown that political life is returning to normal, based on the implementation of the Framework Agreement and on the Stabilisation and Association Process. It is true that the security situation is still fragile. Last week’s incident, which tragically cost the lives of two Polish NATO officers, has been a further illustration that a continued international security presence is needed for the coming months in order to consolidate peace and security in the country and to underpin the implementation of the Lake Ohrid Agreement. This assessment is shared by the government, the President, the main political parties and international players.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I would like to address some of the concerns which may have emerged regarding the scope and the objective of the European Union military mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the European Union operation will only be of limited size, let me state clearly that I do not consider that this has ever been a useful criterion against which to evaluate its worth. It will be a visible sign of our commitment to safeguarding stability in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we do not need to have second thoughts. Our objectives are clear.</p>
<p class="contents">As rightly pointed out in the motion for a resolution, the planned European Union takeover of the NATO military mission will be a further demonstration of the European Union's commitment to peace and stability in the country and in the region. It is fully consistent with our policy to contribute to the long-term security of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Let me just remind the House of the comprehensive package of financial assistance given by the Community in the security sector, under the justice and home affairs heading. Between 2002 and 2004 EUR 31.2 million have been earmarked for this purpose. This encompasses two crucial elements in particular. The first is support for the country to manage its borders through a comprehensive integrated border management programme, which includes creating an effective border police corps. The process of improving border security and management has a strong component of regional cooperation, and so the European Union is currently working closely with NATO and the OSCE to support the efforts which the countries in the region have started to make themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element is support for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in developing a comprehensive strategy for the reform of its police service, to make it a well-trained, multi-ethnic and community-based public service.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Commission, the European Union operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will contribute to consolidating a stable environment conducive to the implementation of reforms that will facilitate its future integration with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this perspective, I have no doubt that a limited and focused EU military intervention can only reinforce progress towards full civilian and democratic control of the reforms under way.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, we spent some time dwelling on an area of foreign and security policy where – I shall be diplomatic – we have not made as much progress as we would have liked. However, we have to recognise that in some parts of the world – most notably in the Balkans – Europe has in the last few years got its act together. You only have to compare the humiliations and bloody mayhem of the early 1990s, when Europe was unable to deal with awful problems on its own doorstep, with our success in the last few years in shaping policy and in helping to lead the countries of the Balkans towards the European family. We know the journey is not an easy one and today's tragedy reminds us how much work there still is for us to do. As I have said in this House before, it would be a terrible mistake if we were to think that the problems in the Balkans, or in Afghanistan for that matter, were done and dusted. We still have to focus, concentrate and be generous with our time, assistance and experience in helping those countries down the road towards eventual membership of the European Union. Whatever the tragic setbacks, I am sure that they will attain that objective in the years ahead.</p>

Whatever disputes and disagreements we may have had with him in individual cases, I do believe that he stood for greater democracy in his country and for a courageous policy in times that made such a thing very dangerous, and that he earned our profound respect by doing so. We should also see this as imposing on us the obligation of making an ongoing contribution to stability and democracy in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we are discussing today is one of the steps to that end. This morning, we demonstrated what a poor position Europe is in when it comes to issues of war and peace. In the Balkans, we have learned from the mistakes of the past, and the European Union has taken on greater responsibilities. Our taking over, for the first time, a military operation in that region in the name of the European Union – small though the operation may be – shows that the European Union is going down a new path and indicates how our capacity to act will develop in this, admittedly small, area. I believe we should take this as a favourable assessment, and so I would like to thank those who have been involved in making it possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are, however, keen to see this debate on plenary's agenda, because we take the view that it is not acceptable for the European Union to decide on a military operation in the name of the European Union without formal consultation with the European Parliament, which is the directly-elected forum for Europe's peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have received information, but it has been received through invitations we have extended and requests we have made. Nothing has been done, though, to accede to Parliament's requests for a proper information procedure, on which basis Parliament might be provided with the information that would facilitate its involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the operation in Macedonia involves only a small contingent of some 300 troops, it is the very first military operation in the history of the European Union, and it marks an important precedent. Right now, the European Union is planning a substantially larger operation for 2004, which will involve taking over NATO's SFOR missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We therefore have a fundamental demand to make of the Council, which is that it should inform and consult Parliament about the mandates for future Petersberg missions before they are mounted. This would be in the spirit of Article 21 of the Treaty and of the joint statement on the financing of the CFSP, adopted as recently as last December by the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Military operations by the European Union, such as are currently planned for the Balkans, differ in one very important respect from missions undertaken by NATO. NATO is a military alliance pure and simple, whereas the European Union is not. Petersberg missions by the European Union will always be mounted in tandem with the EU's involvement in the region affected by a crisis, whether such involvement be political and diplomatic, or economic and financial. Cooperation between civilians and the armed forces under the flag of the European Union will always be an important dimension of the overall mission. That is why it betrays a lack of thought for the Council to believe that it can dispense with Parliament's formal involvement when intergovernmental military operations of this sort are mounted, and that is why we demand that we be involved and informed at an early stage, and in a completely transparent way.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 6 of our resolution lists the questions that we could discuss at an early stage of such missions, such as, for example, with what mandate and with what objectives the mission is being undertaken; what relationship exists between the troops in the regions under EU and NATO command respectively; how they cooperate with other organisations active in the region, such as the UN and the OSCE; how these missions in Macedonia and, next year, in Bosnia and Herzegovina fit into the overall framework of the stability and association process in the Balkans, and within what framework the joint costs are expected to be incurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the answers given today by both of you to the questions in most of these areas have been extensive, but, as I have said, that is not the correct form or the most suitable way; this should have been done already, through other channels, on the initiative of others, and at another time. In saying this, it is not my intention to criticise what you have said today, but to take a critical view of the procedure, of the time, and of the place.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, EU missions will always have the marked character of being both civil and military, and they will operate in crisis-hit regions in which the European Union has already made political or humanitarian commitments, or in which, once a crisis operation is over, it will be involving itself in reconstruction and development. Now that we are beginning, cautiously, to take on responsibilities in military areas too, that is what is special about the European Union – and what sets us apart from a purely military alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">This first mission in Macedonia sees us – even Parliament – breaking new ground. It is for that reason that the Committee on Foreign Affairs’ resolution proposes that we should, in the coming months, send a fact-finding delegation to the theatre of operations, in order to enable us MEPs to get our own picture of how the European Union's first military mission works. Even if the Council has not officially consulted us, we in the European Parliament will not divest ourselves of our responsibility for giving the soldiers from our Member States the parliamentary support that is their due and, in so far as we are able to do so, supporting the mission as a whole.</p>

I would of course like to associate myself with the President-in-Office of the Council's remarks, Commissioner Patten's, and also Mr Brok's, about the tragic events that took place in Belgrade this morning and I support all the expressions of sympathy to Mr Djindjic's family and of course to all Serbs who are undoubtedly very shocked by what has happened there this morning. Let me also express the hope that this will not lead to disruption of the efforts towards greater stability in Serbia and in the former Yugoslavia as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us return to the matter we are debating today. While the Iraq issue is putting the European Union under great pressure and the discord appears great, the European Union will shortly be beginning its first military operation under its own flag in FYROM. And within the wider Europe the Union is now itself taking direct responsibility for an important peacekeeping operation. That this is happening in Macedonia is logical because of the great political efforts of the European Union in recent times, which have led to better relations within the country itself, in particular with the Albanian minority, and which have therefore also led to greater political stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The military mission must of course help make these positive developments permanent. It has taken a while to conclude the mandate of the mission because the European Union cannot of course undertake this mission without the support of NATO and cooperation with it. It was therefore a question of finding the right formula with regard to the independent nature of the operation. This experience shows that we have to keep working on improving the European Union’s own capacities so that there will come a time when the European Union can handle such an operation on its own. The step that is now being taken is in itself important for the country in question, but as has already been said, it is also a first exercise for the European Union and the lessons from it will be learned. In this case it is a matter in particular of practical cooperation with NATO, but also of a future larger-scale operation, in Bosnia-Herzegovina for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Conflict prevention is one of the most important basic principles of European security and defence policy. It is now being put into practice ‘militarily’ for the first time by an operation according to the rules. It is part of a broader package of political and economic measures in support of the stabilisation process in the region in question. It is therefore important that the requisite publicity be given to the mission. It is after all an important step in the development of a common security policy about which the public should be better informed, by such means as, for instance, the work of this Parliament of ours. I hope that a successful mission will also provide a stimulus to maintaining the necessary tempo in setting up the rapid reaction force and in the development and implementation of a more coordinated arms procurement policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution rightly focuses considerable attention on the question of democratic legitimacy or rather the absence of it. It is indeed disappointing to learn that in this unique instance Parliament has not really been consulted. This could be better organised in future. The European Parliament is after all one of the European platforms for the monitoring and assessment of such peacekeeping operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Patten is absolutely right to say that the European Union has got its act together to a considerable extent in the Balkans. I also congratulate the coalition government in place since last September. Let us hope that Macedonia has indeed turned a corner and that the Ohrid Agreement will be fully implemented. A military presence is still necessary to deliver a secure atmosphere and the EU mission can and should carry out tasks such as weapons collection and training.</p>
<p class="contents">For the EU to undertake its first military operation is a truly significant and historic milestone. Mr Brok is quite right to insist that it should not happen without consultation with the European Parliament. The fact that the finalisation of the details has been held up by wrangling over intelligence sharing between NATO and the EU is said to be purely a technical issue. It is illustrative of the interdependence between the two and what we have at stake in making this agreement work. It is right for the EU to take over from NATO and a convincing demonstration that we are serious about playing a larger security role.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal problems facing Macedonia are not limited to military security threats, there are many policing challenges and the cancer of corruption and criminality, often violent criminality, is undermining the state. There are murky links between organised criminals and political extremists and in a neighbouring country, as we have just heard, the murder of Prime Minister Djindjic may be evidence of those links. There can be no economic progress or investment while lawlessness is rife. The Prime Minister of Macedonia wondered who would invest, build and hire new people in a country with constant shootings, a country in one third of whose territory travel after dark is not recommended. He is absolutely right: there is a very close link between security and the growth of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention again the problem of the name. The President-in-Office and the Commissioner use the formulation of FYROM – the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. I refuse to do that. I wish these negotiations over the name could get somewhere – they seem to drag on.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to urge those Member States that have not yet ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, to get on with it. This would send a very good signal to Macedonia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I mention the traditional means: diplomacy, the prevention of conflicts and, when that succeeded, investment in the reconstruction of both infrastructure and institutions. From today or from very soon the European Union, is going, at last, I would say, to be able to add a third means to this and that is the sending of servicemen under the EU flag.</p>
<p class="contents">In the whole debate about the possibility and desirability of a European foreign policy the mission in Macedonia is often dismissed as insignificant, a mission that means nothing and from which we must not draw undue conclusions. I do not agree with this viewpoint or with this dismissive gesture. I think that the Macedonian model, where the European Union has been able to deploy all its diplomatic, financial and military capabilities, can be an example worthy of imitation in many countries of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it was only a small-scale conflict. Of course it is only a limited military presence, but the fact that the EU is now able to use the whole range of options is a symbolic big step forward which – once again, in the shadow of the present debates about Iraq – we are in danger of forfeiting at our peril.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the fine words about what can be done, two warnings. These have already been referred to by my fellow Members. We in the European Union cannot continue in future to send servicemen without any parliamentary control whatever being exercised. All of us present here know that it is impossible either for national parliaments or for this Parliament to influence the mandate and the progress of this mission, or of future missions. We cannot go on this way. Let us be honest, it is and it will be a hugely difficult point. I would therefore in any event like to ask Mr Papandreou, on behalf of the Council, to pursue the widely shared view here in Parliament that this is certainly a good start, but will only be a good start if it is followed by greater parliamentary control, preferably by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">If that succeeds, if a start is made on that and if that is accompanied by a better financial policy and better control of the means for such operations, then that really will be a breakthrough, my fellow Members, without parallel. Then the European Union will finally be able to intervene with a wide range of options, preferably to prevent conflicts and if necessary to <span class="italic">manage </span>crises.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude with a few words about the dreadful murder of Prime Minister Djindjic in Serbia. This murder clearly shows that the problems there are still far from being resolved and also makes clear that the efforts of the European Union are still needed on Serbia’s tortuous, oh so tortuous, path to democracy. I therefore fervently hope that the Commissioner will be able to go to Serbia to put to the Serbian Parliament his message of solidarity with the democratic forces in Serbia. Let us actually hope that in Serbia the traditional means, that is diplomacy and reconstruction, will suffice and that we do not need to move to the use of this new means the EU has at its disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gollnisch (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this operation in Macedonia has just been presented as an historic phase in the commitment of the European Union. I think that we need to set our sights slightly lower than this ambitious presentation. First of all because, in terms of quantity, it is relatively small. It is a mission involving, if we have rightly understood, 500 men, including those in command. Then, because we have not been able to reach an agreement on extremely precise objectives. We are not even capable of agreeing on the name of this country, and I am pleased to be speaking before the Greek Foreign Minister. I would ask why we do not allow the country to use the name that it had when it was a Federal Republic as part of Yugoslavia, as it is clearly understood that the name would not imply any territorial claim or alteration of the borders. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and most importantly, there is no real clear goal for the presence of our forces and we have not been told under what circumstances the mission would come to an end, because the causes of conflict are always there, in particular the gradual Albanianisation of an area that was previously largely populated by Slavs. In short, contrary to what the Committee on Foreign Affairs purports, the mission is not really taking over from NATO. It will be led by the supreme command of the Allied forces in Europe from its headquarters, SHAPE. It is using NATO resources. It seems that, as the United States need their troops in the Middle East, they are sub-contracting this operation, which is now of secondary importance, to their European vassals. I do not think that this is really something we should welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Apart from that, Mr Gollnisch, I take the view that our taking over from NATO responsibility for the mission in Macedonia is an historic event. Even though the unit involved is a very small one, this still creates a precedent, in that structures and possibilities are being created on which we will later be able to build. It is for that reason that I believe this to be an important step on the road that leads to a European defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, the EU is taking on responsibility for the military side of peacekeeping in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. What functions do parliaments have to perform in operations of this kind? It is one of the principles of democratic politics that military operations may be mounted only with the mandate of a directly elected parliament. For Macedonia, these mandates were provided by the national parliaments. If European defence policy is to develop further, mandates will in future have to be given by the European Parliament, and so, our primary expectation of the Council is that it should do what has already been demanded of it and, this very day, meet this need by providing truly comprehensive information and, secondly, we expect the Convention to give parliamentary control a clear, unambiguous and permanent place in the future constitutional treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Those in positions of political leadership must ensure that the troops on the ground are not exposed to unnecessary dangers – and what gives rise to these? They come about as a result of the wrong orders being given or of inadequate leadership and equipment. This consideration leads me to put a number of questions to the Council, and also to the Commission. For a start, what difference will it make that American troops are no longer to be deployed in Macedonia? Might not the loss of certain capacities expose our soldiers to danger?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the way in which decisions are implemented. Are you confident that the decisions taken by the Council will then be implemented by way of NATO, and that, when decisions have to be implemented without delay on the ground, these lines of command really do function as quickly as will be required of them?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I turn to costs, on which I have questions about both the civilian and military sides of this mission. It is my view that both the Convention and the new constitutional treaty will, in future, have to make it possible for the military costs of the mission, as well as the civilian ones, to be borne by the Budget of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that we have seen in this morning's debate on Iraq just how inadequate the European Union's foreign and security policy can still be at the present time, but, at the same time, I would like to give voice to the hope that, at any rate in the European Union's immediate vicinity, where the essence and heart of Europe – of which the Balkans are part – are at stake, we may continue to demonstrate the European Union's capacity to contribute to the maintenance of peace.</p>

Only a few months ago, I was able to have a long conversation with him in his official residence in Belgrade. Despite all the criticisms that could be levelled at him – as they can at any statesman – he was a symbol of economic progress, political reform and also of cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague. He took significant steps to bring Serbia closer to Western fundamental values, not only in terms of its political system, but also of its society. Whatever it is in Serbia and Montenegro that lies behind this assassination, this demonstrates how precarious the situation there is.</p>
<p class="contents">In Macedonia, too, the position remains unstable, as, indeed, we saw at the time of its elections, even though the new coalition, with its collaboration between the Albanian and Macedonian Slav forces – it is always difficult to find a way to express that – has so far proved to be thoroughly durable. Even former combatants – whose inclusion I had strongly criticised – are, at least for the time being, very convincing in their declarations of willingness to work together, at least in theory, and to play a part in parliamentary life.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a precarious situation in the surrounding areas, as the killings in the Presevo valley remind us. Peace has not yet been established. The assassination of Mr Djindjić has yet again made that abundantly clear to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much endorse the progressive Europeanisation – yes, let us call it that – of current security policy and of the military intervention in the Balkans. Whilst there are a number of things of which we are right to accuse America – some other charges laid against them may be misguided, but many are justified – we must ourselves take on responsibilities in our own backyard. That is why I regard this course of action as absolutely right and crucial, trivial though it may at present appear to be. It is also advantageous that this is being done in a country in which there is no crisis at present, one where there may be sporadic conflicts, but where it is also possible to make a good job of the task in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to follow on from what Mr von Wogau said by again emphasising that those in command locally must have sufficient flexibility for their operations, as this is not just about a military unit coming into the situation, but about that unit supporting the population and helping them to coexist with one another and resolve disputes peacefully, without their degenerating into conflict and certainly not by resorting to force of arms.</p>
<p class="contents">For my final point, there is something of which I feel I must remind you: foreign policy also presupposes that we possess good and effective instruments with the appropriate capacity. Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, you are aware of that. Let me just list the ways in which the European Union is currently represented in Macedonia, which is a small country: it is represented by the Presidency, by a representative of the Commission, by a High Representative, by the Agency for Reconstruction, and now also by a military unit. If these all work well together, then that is a good thing, but I really do ask that you should consider how we might tighten up our instruments somewhat in order, instead of giving a small country the impression that we do not ourselves know where we are going, to be able to get our foreign policy accepted by using one shared European language and shared European resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There, we had the experience, in 1999, during the Kosovo conflict, of being able to speak with one voice after a decade of discord; if, though, the United States of America had said that this was a European matter that we had to deal with ourselves, we would not have been in a position to do so. That is why this joint response force has to be built up by 2003, and the fact that we will then be making a start, albeit with a small mission, is, I believe, an important step in terms of European integration policy, whilst underlining at the same time the fact that it is being taken in cooperation with the Americans and with NATO, rather than in opposition to them.</p>
<p class="contents">It will, during this stage, be increasingly important to have due regard to the European Union's institutions and to remain within the bounds of its institutional structures. In was with this in mind that, on 25 November 2002, in the course of the Budget procedure, Parliament and the Council agreed on a statement on the financing of the common foreign and security policy, which statement, firstly, stresses the point that Parliament is to be informed about all basic options under the common foreign and security policy and their financial implications. To this day, the Council has not once complied with that requirement, but this is to be done in future, with a summary being presented, in its own dossier, to Parliament by 15 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is, though, that the Council is not only to do this once a year, but is to promptly state the amount of the prospective costs involved in any and every specific decision in the field of the common foreign and security policy entailing expenditure. This is a new measure agreed on in November. After some hesitation, we are glad that the Greek Presidency, during the most recent consultation with Parliament, undertook to make available to Parliament all the information that had initially been withheld, including that on costs and personnel. I see this as an important decision and as complementing that on the political principle of involving Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that, even though the Western European Union has since been integrated into the European Union, its Parliamentary Assembly continues to exist, the argument for this being that the national parliaments have to keep on meeting together on a regular basis, as the European Parliament does not yet possess rights of control. This example shows how we are already involved in this area. Building on this and, in the event of future missions, such as the taking over of the SFOR mandate, informing this Parliament in due time, is an important step, and what Mr von Wogau said about giving this its own firm place in the European constitution is something I can unreservedly endorse.</p>

The Serbian leaders have recently been surrounding themselves with high-level security, in the knowledge that the greatest danger is just when steps towards normalisation start speeding up. Sadly, it has not worked.</p>
<p class="contents">The murder of Zoran Djindjic has, amongst other things, implications for the tabling of certain amendments to the resolution we are about to put to the vote. I think the two-month period requested for the European Community for initial monitoring of the results of the mission is too short.</p>
<p class="contents">In another context, this morning, when speaking about the European Union action, Commissioner Patten said that military and political intergovernmentalism is ineffectual, and he added more or less that it produces incoherent initiatives. That is clearly the case and we should take it into account. Now, however, we have gone into Macedonia and, for better or for worse, we must clarify certain points and discuss them in this House. We have learnt something during the last hour and perhaps we shall learn something later on that we do not yet know. I should like to know, for instance, how the command structures work, from the base up to Brussels, the relations between departments in NATO and in the European Union, how costs are shared and, naturally, to what extent collaboration with the Macedonian Government and army has been thought out and put into practice. Military expenditure is the responsibility of the national parliaments, but the European Union should manage the financial operations on joint bases and Parliament should then perform its monitoring role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of its key aims is to remove American involvement in European security.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary instrument of this policy is ESDP which otherwise sensible European states have been hoodwinked into supporting. They have been given a false prospectus. Ironically I blame Mr Blair just as much for this because it was he who gave the green light to EU defence policy at St Malo in 1998, and a month ago he compounded his error at Le Touquet.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of this separate ESDP has undoubtedly been a factor in weakening the coherence of the NATO alliance, contributing to the recent very damaging disagreements. Now, and without adequate consultation with the United States, the European Union is preparing to take over the NATO mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and apparently plans to assume the military responsibilities in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is predicated on the bizarre idea that if we set up separate EU decision-making structures, distract NATO's Deputy Commander by giving him two sets of political masters to serve, and stick different flashes on the arms of the same troops in the Balkans, NATO's capabilities are somehow reinforced. By the way, for Mr Gollnisch's information, there are only 30 American personnel in the Macedonian force, and none of them are combat troops.</p>
<p class="contents">To add to this charade, in order for the European Union to raise its flag on a military operation it has to rely on NATO for its operational planning and for reinforcement or extraction if the relatively soft operation in Macedonia should turn into something more dangerous. But the tragic events of today underline how very combustible the situation in the Balkans remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Having created an unnecessary and artificial military divide, the EU and NATO have had to spend two years on negotiating and arrangements to enable the European Union and NATO to find a way of working together. The fact is that the EU's Ruritanian takeover of the NATO operation in FYROM will not contribute any additional military assets. It merely opens the opportunity for political division between European and North American allies at the very time when they should all be sitting around the same table.</p>
<p class="contents">How much simpler if France were merely to rejoin the integrated military structure of the alliance and then everyone would be happy. Instead of building divisions into the western alliance, both the North Americans and like-minded Europeans must make the necessary political and material commitments to revitalise NATO as the primary instrument of western security. We need to bring Europe's military contribution back into the NATO fold and start rebuilding the common western strategic culture before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Papandreou, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>My thanks to the honourable Members for their comments and opinions. I should like to start by saying that, as far as procedure is concerned, the Council fully respects its obligations under the Treaty to inform and involve Parliament in CFSP issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe in the important role of the European Parliament and in transparent, informative relations. That is precisely why I am here today as President-in-Office of the Council and why Commissioner Patten is here today; to report in detail to Parliament on the planned operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, before we take up our duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address Mr Brok, whose comments I have taken on board, and assure him that we shall examine every possibility under the provisions of the Treaty for more efficient and more appropriate briefings to Parliament and of course, for responsible briefings to the citizens of Europe via Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Wiersma that the political and military operation we are undertaking will be an important test for the European Union, which is precisely why we are taking every precaution to ensure it is both credible and successful.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Baroness Ludford, I agree with much of what she said; the problems in the Balkans are not at an end and, as Mr Patten said, the European Union has indeed managed to formulate a strong, single policy for the region. There are no differences between us, between the Member States or the other basic institutions of the European Union, as regards the strategy or, I think, the application of that strategy. I think this shows that our common foreign policy has come of age, in this region at least, and will be important as we develop it further.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise that the problems in the Balkans are very complicated. The issue of organised crime, to which Baroness Ludford referred, cooperation with the ΙCΤΥ, the rule of law, corruption, regional cooperation, the necessary networks, transport, energy, IT; all these are vital to the stability and development of the region and to the region’s common progress towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the presidency are organising the Thessalonika Summit along these lines, precisely with the objective of continuing and furthering progress in these countries towards integration into the European family and generating new momentum, a new contract between us, if you like, whereby we require them to make stable progress and to focus on European preconditions and real progress, with specific measures, specific reforms and specific changes and, as Baroness Ludford said, to address problems such as organised crime and can, for our part, confirm the prospects we offered them at a number of summit Councils of becoming members of the European Union at some point in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say something in my capacity as Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs. As far as the name is concerned, none of us is happy with the name the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, what I would say is that this name is the product of compromise and negotiation within the UN and the UN has adopted this as the official name of this country and international organisations have adopted this as a temporary name. This name does, of course, need to be finalised as quickly as possible and negotiations are in fact under way at the UN. I quite agree and would like to say that we are ready and willing to continue and step up negotiations with the other side, in order to satisfy sensitivities on both sides and find a solution which, as I said, satisfies both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Gollnisch, however, who said something that is not wholly accurate, that the name does not imply any territorial claim, I would say that, unfortunately, the whole problem is that historically, the name was used for territorial claims. Unfortunately the idea of ‘Great Macedonia’ existed until recently and hence the term ‘Macedonia’ had clear connotations of changing borders and assimilating territory from neighbouring countries. Fortunately, this has been dealt with; we have gone beyond this historical aspect at least. More importantly, there has been a spectacular improvement in bilateral relations between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over recent years. We invest more than anyone else in FYROM and we have consistently supported its territorial integrity, prosperity and progress towards Europe during every difficult stage it has been through over recent months and years.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Swoboda that Mr Djindjic took courageous decisions as regards both the ΙCΤΥ and democratic reform and, recently, as regards Kosovo; discussions were due to begin not on the final status of Kosovo, but on important practical arrangements between Belgrade and Pristina, between Mr Djindjic and the leadership in Kosovo. I think that, following his death, we should make a commitment to continue to support the forces of reform, the forces of democracy in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro and help them move towards Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out, in response to Mr Swoboda, that luckily an example is being set in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of proper cooperation between the institutions of the European Union. There is proper coordination between us, as I am sure Mr Patten will agree, and not only between our internal institutions, but also between the European Union and the United States and other organisations such as the ΟSCE and the Council of Europe. This proves there is a need for multilateral cooperation, for close cooperation in dealing with crisis at international level. Where we have this sort of cooperation, this sort of coordination, we are, I think, more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken Mr Laschet’s comments on the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union on board. I too am in contact with the upper echelons of the Western European Union and these are issues that will be discussed during the debate on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on two or three questions raised by Mr Laschet, Mr von Wogau and Mr Van Orden about our cooperation with the United States and European Union/NATO decision-making mechanisms and the danger of operations. First of all, the European Union’s decision-making mechanism, the ESDΡ mechanism, is being tested for the first time, especially as regards military operations. However, we have every faith in the efficacy of our agreed procedures and the fact that this first operation will be carried out using NATO assets and capabilities has helped to speed up the decision taking, as has the fact that one Member State – France – has been selected as the framework nation, thereby safeguarding the unity and command structure of the operation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the military operation and any dangers inherent in it, naturally unavoidable dangers are inherent in any military operation. However, as far as this specific operation is concerned, as I said in my statement, we shall continue to cooperate with ΝΑΤΟ and there are plans to use NATO reserves if the situation deteriorates. The ΝΑΤΟ staff in Skopje will continue to operate, as will KFOR Rear. This being the case, and given the assessments made so far, we consider the risk to be relatively low.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to the funding of the mission. As you know, spending on defence is not covered by the Community budget and the operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will therefore be funded by the Member States. Of course, it would be useful if future operations under the ESDP could be funded from the Union budget, but that requires institutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">On that note, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for listening. Rest assured that I am at your disposal, time permitting, and I fully intend to keep you abreast of any procedures, decisions or developments in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
