By 'we' I mean Parliament, assuredly also with the Commission's support, but the Commission manifested a mild attack of weakness during the procedure with regard to what we considered necessary to the labelling of compound feedingstuffs. I think that honourable Members will back me up when I state quite clearly that, if Parliament had not had the right of co-decision in this area, we would not have been able to push this through. Quite apart from the matter under discussion, I wish, then, to emphasise that we need the right of co-decision in all agricultural policy matters so that, as we have done in this instance, we can come to sound and sensible results and make use of the expertise and political wisdom that reign in Parliament to support the Commission – and, I would expressly observe, to support a strong position taken by the Commission – to achieve satisfactory outcomes in the debates with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue of open declaration has come a long way. We are now amending a directive dating back to 1979, when open declaration, which existed in Germany at any rate, was abolished at European level, and since which time I have also been active in this field, attempting to make good what went wrong then. It is a long time, 25 years, since then, but patience is needed in politics as everywhere else. That we have achieved this result is surely due to there having been the BSE crisis, which made it clear that farmers have to know what they are giving as feedingstuff if they are then to take on the responsibility for the feeding of their animals. This catastrophe has taught us, in the meantime, that everything we feed to animals is itself in the food chain and is – admittedly by a circuitous route rather than directly – fed to human beings as well. This makes it a matter of urgency that farmers should know what the feedingstuffs contain.</p>
<p class="contents">We then asked you, Commissioner Byrne, and also Mr Fischler, within the framework of the parliamentary procedure to install the Commission in office, where you stood on open declaration. At the time you said: "Yes, open declaration should come into being." Indeed it did, but it took another two-and-a-half or three years for the legislation to be tabled. But a good thing is worth waiting for. As I have said, the Council then withdrew the good proposal from the Commission, in which the only improvement we had made was to the positive list, and the Commission agreed to the Council's proposal for a less precise declaration to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The result we have achieved is a change of direction – a change to the right direction. We now have open declaration. The 15% tolerance takes account of the industry's supplies and actual practice in order to avoid the possibility of partial rejection of feedingstuffs, but we have also made it possible for farmers to be told on request the exact composition of fodder and feedingstuffs. We have likewise obliged the Commission to supply us with a positive list, or at least a draft positive list, by the end of next year, so that we can achieve a positive result in this area within the life of this Parliament. There must be stipulations as to what can find its way into feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, finally, to express my warmest thanks to my colleagues, most especially to Mr Friedrich, the Vice-President, who chaired the Committee, but also to Mr Kindermann. The three of us made up the negotiating delegation, and I must say that if we had not brought such determination, such a common mind, and what was almost joy, to the work in order to show for once that we too were in a position to turn our thoughts into words and laws, then all this would not have been possible. So, many thanks. I believe we have done a good job, and it was interesting to take part in a conciliation procedure of this sort. We did, admittedly, say that a mountain had roared and brought forth a mouse, for, in view of what was up for negotiation, a gigantic effort was involved. But it was good, too, to get an insight into something like that. So, to all who took part, including our other colleagues, many thanks. This result is something we can face our countries and our electors with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is specifically with reference to co-decision that it has at last been made clear that Parliament keeps on coming up with good ideas that find their way into work like this report on the never-ending story about the declaration of compound feedingstuffs. We must be clear in our own minds that we are dealing here with large quantities, and therefore with a lot of money – not the European Union's money, but that of our partners in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a volume of some 400 million tonnes of feedingstuffs, and it will help us to grasp how much we are talking about if we note that half, about 200 million tonnes, is made up of commercial feedingstuffs, and compound feedingstuffs make up two-thirds of that, some 115 million tonnes. As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf pointed out, the conciliation procedure eventually achieved a satisfactory result on the most important points at third reading stage by involving all interested parties – something which I should like very much to commend. As Parliament demanded, there is now open quantitative declaration, and, although the 15% is in my opinion at the upper edge of the margin, consensus has nonetheless been reached. It was also clearly stated that the producer, must however, and I see the 'must however' as very important here, state the exact percentages involved at the customer’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the positive list. About 20 000 components have been mentioned, and the drawing up of this positive list may well be a difficult task, but it will, I think, be an interesting and important one. More time has been conceded, and even more for formulation following the directive's implementation, but it is, I think, important that it should happen that way. Perhaps the evaluation report would present the right opportunity to introduce further improvements, such as, for example, the possible certification of the producer of the compound feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one more point I would like to mention, namely that the first positive list, to look at things in a European perspective, was the so-called purity law for beer. As I have said before, it was instituted in 1486 in the area I come from, and made applicable to the whole of Bavaria in 1516. It was a fine positive list for the production of beer, and you should put all your drive and ambition into drafting an equally good positive list for compound feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, particular thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, to the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Friedrich, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Kindermann for the tough and persistent negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to congratulate, above all, the rapporteur on his commitment to the matter in hand and, most of all, warmly thank him for cooperating so well with his other colleagues, too.</p>
<p class="contents">If the result is confirmed by this House as a whole, it will represent a further significant step towards greater transparency and safety in the production of feedingstuffs. In addition to this proposal for a regulation, though, there are other reports which also deal with feedingstuffs and with regard to which negotiations are currently in progress between Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Commission. I am thinking here only of the draft regulation on animal by-products not intended for human consumption – especially Category III, but also of the future use of leftovers from meals and waste from the production of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that it should continue to be possible to use these by-products, processed under secure conditions and subject to strict controls and, above all, with the stages in processing being effectively monitored, as high-quality feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, unless the results of future scientific research suggest otherwise. I look forward to the same willingness to compromise, not only on the part of Parliament, but also on the part of the Commission and of the Council, as was demonstrated in the process that we are discussing this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, Parliament achieved what it wanted. This is a very important matter from the point of view of the farmers; these are the people who in their everyday work have to deal with these matters, and this information is very important to them.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf stated, in Germany open declaration was eliminated in 1979, while here in Finland it was eliminated in 1995. Now it is being reinstated. The only matter which generated debate and which deserves a moment's consideration is this list of permitted substances, and, in particular, the fact that the various ingredients change all the time. These include the byproducts of the food industry which Mr Kinderman mentioned; new feedingstuffs arrive all the time, while others disappear. For this reason, some sound common sense will be called for here. We must take thought and find out what is right and what is good, and only after that, on the basis of experience, must we go about implementing matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again my warm thanks go to the consultative committee, which carried out splendid work from the viewpoint of Parliament and, particularly, from that of the farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Community's Member States are still, in any case, responsible for the monitoring of feedingstuffs, and, as the parties in this whole process represent very diverse interests, it will be necessary, within the foreseeable future, to discuss monitoring programmes which will standardise supervision of feedingstuffs composition and norms across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the key data laid down in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with my own experience. What worries me, though, is the apportionment of costs, specifically the costs of the declaration itself and for the monitoring of it. I wish to put on record my opposition to the costs continuing to be offloaded onto the farmers. I take the view that the transparency principle means that implementation of the procedure must involve the producers of feedingstuffs, its importers, dealers in it, and, above all, those who monitor it – who will be numerous – also themselves guaranteeing the apportionment of their costs. It is also my opinion that there should be safety standards in the production of feedingstuffs to guarantee and safeguard the health of people and animals, ensuring that no products come onto the market that are dubious from the point of view of health and consumer protection, which, of course, presupposes the principle that good technical production practice does not start, and is not interrupted, at purely arbitrary points.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that apportionment on this basis at every production site must prove itself in the next few years and I hope, after this report and after the positive result achieved in the Conciliation Committee, that there will not be another scandal somewhere or other in the foreseeable future, whether in wine, honey, or the many feedingstuffs we can expect to be listed, be they positive, negative, coloured green or anything else, for the list will surely be an enormous one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is to say, firstly, the obligatory declaration of all raw materials, with a tolerance level of 15%, and the obligation of feed producers to communicate the exact percentages, whenever required by animal farmers, to which I believe we should add a time limit, set previously in this legislation, and, secondly, the positive list – which all the previous speakers have mentioned – which the Commission must present before the end of 2002, once the viability studies have been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to restoring consumer confidence, following the recent food crises (BSE, dioxins, etc.) absolute transparency is necessary, even indispensable. However, ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of how, within the scope of the codecision procedure, it is possible to reach reasonable agreements – good agreements, I would say – and we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will therefore continue to ask the Council to gradually extend that procedure to all legislative actions in the field of the Community’s agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost two years of negotiations with the Commission and the Council within the framework of the conciliation procedure have at last enabled us to reach a compromise on regulations on the labelling of compound feedingstuffs. When this House votes tomorrow on this directive, it can do so, I believe, with its mind very much at ease.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this directive as proof that Parliament must in future have a right of co-decision in agricultural matters as well. As we are all aware, the crucial issues were the open declaration, the positive list and an evaluation report. Parliament's main concern was to lay down exact regulations on labelling that would provide for compulsory details of both the quantity and quality of ingredients. Even with the Council, which did not originally share this position, a compromise text could eventually be agreed on, according to which the ingredients must now be stated by percentage of weight with a margin for error and according to which farmers must be given the exact percentages if they request them. This binding statement of permissible ingredients is the only guarantee that consumers can in future have greater confidence in farmers' products, and we farmers know how much we need consumers' approval and trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive list to be produced by the end of 2002 should make that possible. On the positive side, I would like to make the additional observation that Parliament must also be involved in any future amendments to the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both these points had been at the core of Parliament's concerns, but had initially been rejected by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report is the very model of successful legislative work by Parliament and the Council. In spite of all the differences between the political groups, constructive collaboration made it possible to draw up points that were important to us members of Parliament's agricultural committee, and the final result was a positive one thanks to circumspect negotiations in the conciliation procedure, guided by our Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, whom I would like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking. This was the right step in the right direction. Not only was it possible for Parliament to see its two core concerns accepted, but the Council also had positive elements to contribute. The possibility of a <span class="underline">+</span> 15% tolerance margin for feedingstuff ingredients is something I see as acceptable, in that the manufacturer must state the exact percentages at the customer’s request. Equally in line with good practice is an evaluation report after three years and, if need be, adjustment of the tolerance margin in the light of scientific and technical developments. It would be desirable if we could make greater future use of the co-decision procedure on CAP matters and continue to work together as constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever our successes, I would like to conclude with the single warning that good European rules are of no use unless they are monitored. The BSE and dioxin crises do not in some way reflect faults in European regulation; they were, rather, the result of criminal and questionable practices, which we must counter with determination and in new ways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The marketing of compound feedingstuffs today has certainly improved in terms of traceability and transparency of composition – two issues of great concern for our major customer, the European citizen. These principles can apply to all feeds to animals. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf says farmers must know what is in their feed, Mr Kindermann applies this to slops and waste and catering waste and I fully agree with those statements. This piece of legislation is one of the milestones needed to build certainty and confidence. Farmers are entitled to basic information to be able to properly inform their customers.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very beginning, the Council encountered great difficulties in agreeing on a common position. Most Member States were opposed to this obligation and the positions of Parliament and the Council were quite far apart. At the time, with a view to reaching a compromise, the Commission accepted the Council's position which finally had the unanimous support of all the Member States. This led to a difference in view between Council and Parliament after the second reading in April. I am pleased, however, that an acceptable solution has been found in the conciliation with the declaration of all feed materials under their specific name indicating the exact percentages with a tolerance level of around 15%.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as regards the demand for a positive list of feed materials, I have already on several occasions outlined the Commission's reservations. This concerns especially the deadline of presenting a proposal by the end of next year. This task is very complex. The Commission has already launched a feasibility study on this issue. The call for tenders was published last June and the contractor is currently working on the matter and will also contact Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I accordingly undertake to send the report on the outcome of this study to the Council and Parliament as soon as possible and in any case before 31 December, 2002. I cannot, however, guarantee that I will be in a position to present a legislative proposal on the establishment of a positive list. For this reason, it has been necessary for the Commission to make a declaration on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
