<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome. So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other. I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation. With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.</p>
<p class="contents">To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations. Both biological and economic information are included. The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form. Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme. It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data. It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects. The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee. The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission. The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations. The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.</p>
<p class="contents">Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment. Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission. This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7. Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally. Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation. It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation. First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes. One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued. The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales. It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality. In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information. The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind. It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems. This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary. It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes. It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.</p>
<p class="contents">As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts. The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes. The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects. There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective. Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 ‘Internal Policies’, Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion. This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner. This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission’s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States. The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur’s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group has included two reasonable requests. The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission’s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the years, the Commission has provided the Council and Parliament with a steady stream of communications on the market situation for fisheries products. The object of the exercise was to debate the future prospects of a sustainable European fisheries policy, or rather, to redetermine the content, with regard to production, trade, marketing and various other spheres. I can only make brief mention here of key words such as competition, security of production, quality of production, and others. The report, which I endorse, also leads one to form the conclusion that the Commission is still a very long way off the realisation of its goal, that of developing a sustainable fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Several Articles and proposed amendments refer to the difficulties that have not yet been resolved. The implementing regulation will clear a few matters up. I also support all those evaluations that refer to the fact that the 265 000 fishermen working in the EC, who often live in remote coastal areas and who work and secure an income on the bottom rung of Objective 1 Regions, are not sufficiently well-prepared for the establishment of a common EU internal market, in view of the opening up of the world trade market. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention at this point to the structural problems in pond management, and to the question of how it relates to agriculture. Since I am unable to go into the current grey area in greater detail, I would propose that we use a new fisheries policy to make clear decisions in this regard as well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions. I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission. Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue. Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry. I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.</p>

It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move. We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice. It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase? What is the point of banning European drift nets in the <span class="italic">île d’Yeu </span>or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch? What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it. What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide. Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing – although it plays a serious and negative part – but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence. But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats. For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity. That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission relies on the Member States for the collation of this data. A Community framework for the collation of this data adds some structure and improves accessibility for the purpose of scientific evaluation. </p>
<p class="contents">The question, however, is whether or not the Member States would be prepared, under this new regime, to make the necessary data available at the requested time. Effective sanctions and/or incentives, which aim to encourage Member States to adopt a more serious approach, are lacking from the Commission’s proposal. Moreover, can we rely sufficiently on this information? How reliable is fishing data, as long as there are still large amounts of fish being caught illegally, as British fisherman David Cox recently admitted in <span class="italic">Fishing News</span>?</p>
<p class="contents">And what should we make of the data on fleet capacity? Further to the Court of Auditor’s criticism, in January this Parliament adopted my amendment to the Cunha report with a large majority. The amendment requests independent verification of fleet capacity data. I would like to know from the Commission how it has processed this recommendation, which is also endorsed by the Advisory Committee. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, radical decisions are sometimes mainly based on opinions presented by biologists. We therefore have everything to gain from improving the accuracy of biological predictions, for example by certifying the drafting of these opinions. Furthermore, the Commission must provide sufficient financial means for the inspection of stock levels. It is also recommended that more use be made of the expertise and experience gathered by fishermen when biological opinions are drafted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing. The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry. I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard. At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen’s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared. That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard. It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.</p>
<p class="contents">I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong. As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002. However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission’s proposal. This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data. Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set. These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises. We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data. Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States. I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk. In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes. It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge. I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging. If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years’ time about the future of the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties. Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities. A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements. To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union’s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted. However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past. A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country’s fishing industry. After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish. A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases. The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal. We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would also like to thank all of you for your great interest in, and support for, the two Commission proposals. One thing is certain: there will be no common fisheries policy if it is not based on a common data support framework. Reliable and complete data are a fundamental prerequisite for credible fisheries management, still more so for creating what we constantly refer to as a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a few comments on the first report. I completely understand why you have proposed, as expressed in the Amendment, that ecological data should also be included. However, I could only support the collection of data of this kind if a clear data framework was to be put in place first of all and, above all, if the necessary additional budgetary funds were to be made available. As far as Amendment No 2 is concerned, I would point out that we set great store by the collection of economic data. However, if we were to accept your Amendment and not collect data relating to income from catches but only data relating to the volume of catches, then this would actually weaken the proposal, for we need data about income, particularly if we are to be able to assess the economic situation of fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we support your proposal to the effect that more precise statistics should be collected on the employment situation. I have the following to say to you on the subject of Amendment No 6, namely all recorded data to be automatically transmitted to the Commission: the Commission will automatically receive all the necessary data on request. There is no point in setting up a central database in Brussels when much of this data is needed for international meetings a long way from Brussels. Tried and tested methods for the transmission of scientific and technical data should be retained because they work well.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I can accept parts of your Amendment No 7 in the first report and 6 in the second report. I believe it is an extremely good idea for us to record how we have made use of the data collected, in our report to Parliament and the Council. I also agree with you that we should present our first report in good time after 2002, against the background of the common fisheries policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the second report by Mrs Attwooll: in Amendment No 1 you recommend placing the funding under heading 1b and not under heading 3 of the Community budget. However, expenditure on supervisory and information activities for fisheries also comes under heading 3. I therefore believe that data collection, which, at the end of the day, is also of use for supervisory purposes, also belongs under this heading. However, this issue has yet to be definitively resolved. It will need to be revisited in further detail in April, within the scope of the draft budget procedure for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 and 5, according to which the Commission is to transmit all financial, and also all situation reports produced by the Member States, appear to me to be superfluous, for after all, we have given a commitment to prepare a report evaluating the measures adopted by the Member States, and this report will contain an assessment of the entire data collection system.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Several other amendments relate to the schedule we have proposed. I wholeheartedly endorse these amendments. The deadlines that we originally put forward in our proposal were on the basis of an earlier adoption of the proposals and are no longer realistic. The Commission, in cooperation with the Council, will see to it that a realistic schedule is established. However, I must make clear reference to the fact that we must meet tight deadlines, and that that there will be absolutely no question, for example, of granting six-month deadlines for the presentation of data collection programmes. Lastly, the remaining amendments help to clarify the wording and the Commission accepts them in their entirety.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
