<p class="contents">In response to a request from over 100 Members of the European Parliament from all 15 current Member States, the World Health Organisation recently agreed to look into making recommendations for improving the accuracy of national statistics on sudden unexplained death in young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Experts across Europe deplore the fact that these deaths are registered and coded as due to causes which are sometimes vague or incorrect and as a consequence it is difficult to get an accurate picture of the real scale of the problem.</p>

<p class="contents">In reply to your question, Mrs McAvan, I must tell you that, through its current activities, Eurostat contributes in various ways to the work of the World Health Organisation, within the context of the Community Statistical Programme 2003-2007; and, in particular, in relation to public health statistics, Eurostat collects, confirms and publishes annual data relating to causes of death in the Member States of the European Union, the candidate countries and the countries of the European Free Trade Association, at both national and regional levels. Data is collected in coordination with the World Health Organisation and the latter is regularly informed of Eurostat’s work in the field of public health statistics and is invited to the relevant meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, with regard to statistics on causes of death, important issues have still to be resolved in relation to the quality and comparability of data, for example issues which were very well set out in the report <span class="italic">Comparability and Quality Improvement of European Causes of Death Statistics</span>. Notable amongst the issues described in this report are those relating to certification, including the issue of the accuracy of data relating to sudden and unexplained deaths of young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Work has begun with a view to improving the quality of data in close coordination with the Member States and with the World Health Organisation in order to provide the Member States with better training instruments. For doctors who certify deaths – and for medical students – the European Union training programme on the certification of causes of death has been developed in conjunction with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the work to improve the process for certifying deaths, activities aimed at improving quality are being carried out, such as the application of automated codification in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The collection of information might seem like a very dry subject, but the problem at the moment is that, without such information, no proper research can take place into why people die very suddenly, particularly young people. As a result research is not carried out. In the case of cot deaths 20 years ago, we changed the classification and then more research was done. My follow-up question is more a request to the Commission - to whoever is responsible for Eurostat - that part of the training for those who certify death should look at the question of sudden unexplained deaths. At the moment, people often put down heart failure, for example, and then it is not clear that the death is totally and utterly unexplained. It is very important that training should focus on that particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask you to ask Eurostat to keep Members of the European Parliament informed in this area. The WHO is going to revise its guidelines at its meeting in October. I hope that, through cooperation with WHO, we will be kept informed about what changes are made and that we will see improvements in the kind of classification, which may lead to better research and the prevention of these unexplained deaths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eurostat – the statistical agency which is my responsibility as Commissioner – has the greatest possible interest in the information communicated to it on causes of death being as accurate as possible, but what it cannot do is change the current headings. The study I referred to before states that the headings can be improved since some of them lead to confusion. This is not, however, the responsibility of Eurostat, it is the responsibility of the World Health Organisation. What is the responsibility of Eurostat – and we are doing this – is to provide training for people required to carry out certifications and, to this end, Eurostat has prepared a training package consisting essentially of three elements: a basic certification for European Union-level certification, a website which serves as an on-line training tool for people required to carry out certifications and printed information which is also available on the Internet in the form of a <span class="italic">pdf</span> leaflet which provides people required to carry out certifications with details of the requirements and methods for collecting the most accurate information possible, so that that information – for the purposes you have indicated and which we all agree with – can be used as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore working on it, we are continuing with this training effort, with the cooperation of the World Health Organisation. What we cannot do is assume the responsibility for changing these headings which may be creating a degree of confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to tell you, though, that the only competences we as a Community can exercise are subsidiary in nature. Accordingly, the Commission cannot act except in order to add to and back up the action taken by sporting organisations and by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have taken action. In 1999, the Commission adopted a Community anti-doping support plan and set out approaches that the campaign against doping might take. I have to say that we have had full support from your House, whereas there has been little or no response on the part of the Council; even so, we have embarked on practical action to combat doping, with, for example, analyses of the situation of young people in sports centres – which is disastrous – on socio-economic factors in doping and on the steps to be taken to protect young people. At the same time, we have helped the Member States to set up, jointly with the sporting world and with the sports federations, the World Anti-Doping Agency. We have made a practical contribution to this agency by training doping inspectors whose task is to carry out inspections on sportsmen and sportswomen.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards health programmes, too, steps have been taken to prompt Member States to act to prevent the use and abuse of drugs by young people. Prevention is, of course, also of the utmost importance, and so I would inform you that 2004 has been declared the ‘European Year of Education through Sport’. Throughout the year, thousands of projects have been set up in conjunction with schools, sporting associations and local and regional authorities in order to make young people aware of the dangers of doping and to encourage them to adhere to the principle of fair play in their sporting activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we will be unable to do more for as long as there is no clear and precise legal basis, but we have done some work on producing one. Ever since I was, in 1999, appointed Commissioner for Sport, I have organised, on a regular basis, an informal Council of Sports Ministers – we were unable to have a formal one – in order to encourage them to cooperate towards this end. Also on a regular basis, I have had meetings with Europe’s sporting association in order to encourage them, too, to join together in fighting the scourge of doping. Finally, the Convention has set the seal on this work by giving us its support and by proposing an article for the Constitutional Treaty that would require the EU to aim to protect the physical and moral integrity of the young, and of young sportsmen and sportswomen in particular. Once the treaty has been adopted, a real legal basis will be in place; we will be able to have official meetings of sports ministers, and will be able to take practical action. We are all looking forward to the new treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When a sports team is a business, the team itself and its sponsors set increasing profits as their objective and, consequently, every sacrifice and every victory won at all costs by the athlete is a means of maximising profits. In addition, commercialisation alters the real nature of sport and the existence of the 'professional athlete' poisons and undermines every moral basis for amateur sport. Sport is a public and social commodity and cannot enter into the rationale of private profit.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask you if you intend to take measures to make sport a truly social commodity and ensure it remains outside the rationale of profit and sponsorship.

<p class="contents">I do not agree, however, with two points that he makes. Firstly, he suggests that there is a clear difference between amateur sport and professional sport. Our studies have, unfortunately, shown that amateur sport has also been affected by the phenomenon. We must therefore fight doping among not only professional athletes, but also amateur athletes, and we must focus on public health, given that doping is becoming a genuine public health problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point made by the honourable Member with which I take issue is the idea that, despite all the measures in place, not only has the situation failed to improve, it has in fact worsened. The answer is very simple: as long as we deny that doping takes place and that there is a need to take action to control it, the offenders will not be worried. Now that everyone acknowledges that doping takes place everywhere and now that we have put controls in place in conjunction with the International Olympic Committee and WADA, the World Anti-doping Agency, we are, of course, catching people who take drugs and that is a good thing. The more people we catch, the fewer people there will be who will risk taking drugs and the more we will be sending out the positive message that ‘you cannot get away with doping’ and that an extremely fierce battle is now being organised against this scourge that is killing sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What shall we be able to do once the Treaty is in force? We shall be able to take direct action in the field of sport. Firstly, there is to be a Council of Sports Ministers, which will be empowered to make joint proposals with the Commission. The Commission itself will be able to propose action programmes, funded, of course, by the European Union, to help sports federations, governments, educators and clubs to move in the right direction. This will, therefore, change everything. For the time being, I feel that all that we have done has been in preparation for this new treaty, yet we really must have a legal basis to be able to produce a more solid and higher profile policy.

We have no legal basis in this field. We are not in a position to undertake any harmonisation action, nor to table a directive in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, moreover, like to point out that, even if a new Treaty is adopted, we shall only be able to act in support of the Member States in this matter. I should also like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that we have Court of Justice precedents at our disposal. Various Court of Justice rulings in this field underline the European sports federations’ responsibility and autonomy, provided that those federations comply with basic Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be very happy if, in the future, more opportunities were made available for us to move forward. Moreover, as regards combating crime, for example, I should like to remind Parliament that, in 2002, the Commission and the Spanish Presidency organised a seminar in Spain that brought together for the very first time those responsible for the fight against doping and representatives of the border police and customs authorities. This is a highly complex issue; it is a problem that concerns internal security; it is a problem that concerns medicine labelling; it is a problem that concerns sport; it is a problem that concerns the protection of young people; and it is a problem that concerns public health. All of these elements must be coordinated so that the outcome is practical action. It is true, however, that apart from in the area of medicine labelling, we have no legal basis at all at our disposal for harmonising and for taking the major steps forward, as we should be doing. In reality, what we have attempted to do, by coordinating actions and by making the most of our moral strength in this area, has been even more than we could feasibly do. We have exceeded our competences, but I felt that it was right to do so and I feel that I was right to undertake this anti-doping action, which is the only way to protect our young people and to bring fair play back to sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This legislation makes it possible for consumers to make free choices by means of clear labelling and a case-by-case risk analysis and also guarantees that genetically-modified organisms authorised in the European Union are harmless to human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The request for authorisation of foods derived from maize from line NK 603 was presented in April 2001 and has been dealt with and analysed over all this time in accordance with the legislation in force. The States of the Union and the European Food Safety Authority studied this request and the opinion published by the EFSA indicates that it has no objections from the point of view of safety. There is a validated detection method for this genetically-modified organism which will make it possible to trace and label in accordance with the current rules.</p>
<p class="contents">All the necessary conditions for its authorisation are therefore fulfilled. The authorisation of genetically-modified organisms, foods and feedstuffs is essentially based on safety criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the possible economic repercussions, I would like to stress that foods and ingredients derived from various lines of genetically-modified maize have been notified or authorised for marketing and, therefore, the authorisation of this new NK 603 line would extend the range of possibilities but would not in any way set a precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out, however, that the authorisation has not yet taken place and that an application relating to it, presented, I would emphasise, in accordance with the 2001 Directive, is being examined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the previous debate on Belarus and this one on genetically-modified organisms have coincided is testament to the fact that you are doing a good job of defending your views, Mr Czarnenecki, and that is your job.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to you that the current Community legislation, which is the result of the negotiations between this Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission, finally granted the Commission the power to authorise a genetically-modified organism by means of a legislative procedure know as the comitology procedure. This procedure – as the honourable Member is aware – is used in many areas of Community legislation, and is provided for in the current legislation, and allows the Member States of the Union to play an important role and the European Parliament to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">This procedure does not authorise the Commission to act against a majority in the Council. Nevertheless, when there is no sufficient majority in the Council – when there is a majority, but not a sufficient one – in favour of or against the proposed measure, the Commission can and must act.</p>
<p class="contents">In authorising this NK 603 line, therefore, the Commission will simply be fulfilling its obligation to apply Community legislation, and I would like to point out that the companies legitimately trust that their applications will be dealt with fairly and objectively, in accordance with the Community legislation in force approved by this Parliament and by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the new varieties, they will all be analysed in a fair manner, with the two essential objectives: their traceability and the verification that they are harmless to health and to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, each new variety proposed will have to be analysed in the context of an individualised approval. There will be no generic approvals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware, for example, that there is also fraud in the use of hormones. As a former Agriculture Minister I can tell you that we must be extremely vigilant in order to prevent this fraud and tackle it if it takes place. The important thing is that the consumer can make the choice.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second issue, you have mentioned unfair competition in relation to farmers. Unfortunately, we are not talking about unfair competition. If there is any unfair competition, the competition will relate to the traditional varieties of the various products. Any possible unfair competition from NK 302 will be with the traditional varieties of maize which have been cultivated in Europe and throughout the world. Farmers may choose to use them or not. They can use any of the varieties. Competition, if there is any unfair competition, will, moreover, be between laboratory varieties and natural varieties. I believe that citizens and politicians have a responsibility here as well. We have the possibility of choosing what we want: traditional varieties or new laboratory varieties. Consumers themselves will ultimately be free to choose how this issue develops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The discussions intensified with the proposed Directive presented by the Commission in 2001, and the in-depth debates which took place in relation to it led the Commission to introduce various modifications to the text, particularly in response to the opinions expressed by Parliament at first and second readings. Nevertheless, having adopted a text in conciliation, at the last vote this Parliament rejected it. The margin was minimal, but as we know, one vote is enough.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new wording of its proposals on port services, the Commission is trying to reflect the legitimate concerns of all parties. Likewise, in the new proposal we are preparing, we are, moreover, trying to respond to the objections raised to self-assistance from the points of view both of safety and of social protection and the environment. The new proposal will probably require all port service providers to be subjected to a system of authorisations which guarantees compliance with the applicable safety, employment and environmental rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach differs fundamentally to the proposal of 2001 and is intended to respond to the concerns expressed by those who called for greater attention to be paid to these points. Bearing in mind that the necessary authorisations will guarantee equal conditions for port services, there will not be any reason to stop companies carrying out self-assistance from using their own land-based staff.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to pilotage, the proposal being prepared will probably incorporate a specific system, with a view to taking account of maritime safety aspects, and will provide for the application of public service obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress the importance of developing the role to be played by ports in transferring the growth in goods traffic by road to short-sea shipping. In order to guarantee a competitive transport system in the European Union, I believe it is absolutely essential that a significant proportion of the new demand, which we expect to grow by around 40% in ten years for goods, be channelled towards maritime cabotage within an enlarged Europe. This will prevent other types of congestion problems which are already beginning to appear in other types of infrastructures, such as roads or railways, which also require significant modernisation and must be made more dynamic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, we must be clear: do we or do we not want to promote maritime traffic and transport?</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to promote maritime transport, we have to make it more dynamic and more competitive, without reducing the safety aspects or producing any kind of social dumping, naturally. Neither, however, must we make it obligatory – as in some ports of the European Union today, for example – when loading or unloading a lorry onto a roll-on roll-off transport system to employ a specific driver from port staff or pay somebody – although they are not employed – as if they were employed. That would clearly mean imposing obstacles and unjustified costs for maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, if we really want to promote maritime cabotage, we need to make it as fluid as possible. To this end, we have put forward a series of proposals – some are already operational – relating to administrative simplification, the use of new technologies and the harmonisation of forms, thereby making it possible for the maritime sector to enjoy the same facilities as, for example, TIR road systems.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not enough, however. Ports must also be promoted as multimodal hubs and made more dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout all this time we have held discussions with the sectors. During previous discussions I met on repeated occasions with all the representatives of the piloting, docking and loading sectors. I have met all the sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We have continued to hold meetings with them – myself in some cases, such as the last one I held in Puerto de Amberes, and in other cases the Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that, during the coming discussions, my successor – who will be responsible for promoting them – will continue to hold fluid talks and contacts with all the sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certainly the case is that there are certain types of situations which could perhaps be called privileged – I am not sure whether they are – or which simply involve closed elements, which cannot be maintained. We must move towards greater openness, which, I would emphasise, is going to mean more work, more activity, greater possibilities and greater wealth for all the European Union’s port areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, although I am grateful for your openness and for the candour with which you have spoken, I still wonder what the compelling circumstances are for you to table this proposal in the dying days of your career as a Commissioner, when your mandate has only six weeks left to run? You have told Mr El Khadraoui that you have consulted all those involved and refer in this respect to your visit to the Antwerp port. I live in Antwerp and if you ask me, the last time you visited the Antwerp port was when the debate about the previous directive, which was rejected by this Parliament, was in full swing. I therefore see no signs of consultation about the new text. Like Mr El Khadraoui, I would emphatically ask you what your timeframe is. You have failed to give a response to this question so far. Finally, Commissioner, surely you must realise that what you stated a moment ago with regard to the statute of the Belgian and Flemish dockworkers is nothing short of a declaration of war, and that you will certainly not solve the issue with this kind of approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not matter to me that I am only in the job for another month and a half; I am going to present what I believe I must present if it is ready for presentation. I do not intend to fail to present anything and leave outstanding issues for my successor just because I am leaving.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been employed, and this Parliament has put its trust in me, until 1 November. And I intend to carry out my duties fully until 1 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if anybody has declared war, it is certain sectors. I am not declaring war on anybody. Quite the opposite, what I have been holding over all these years has been a series of debates. In fact, there has been a slight mistake: my last meeting was in Rotterdam, in a port city, and I met there with all the representatives of the port unions. It is true that in a very civilised and correct manner I was shown certain placards and banners asking me to go away and other less friendly things, I know. We were, however, discussing all the issues. I am not, moreover, waging a war on anybody whatsoever. All I am doing is offering clear support for maritime transport and furthermore I am talking about maritime cabotage. Are we able to ensure that the lorry I referred to or the trailer in other types of transport can move around as freely as possible and at the least cost in this form of transport and transfer in ports, with costs that are truly justified and not artificial such as, for example, the one to which I have referred? I could also point to the case of the captain who sails the same route once or twice per week and enters the same port once or twice per week: does he not know the problems involved in bringing the ship – his ship – into that port as well as any pilot who has been doing so for a while? These are the issues we must deal with and if we are to talk about promoting maritime traffic, we must bear in mind that this must be incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not against anybody, but rather I am in favour of certain things: in favour of port activity, of wealth in ports, of the development of port cities and areas and in favour of the European economy, competitiveness and living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many of the elements of the proposal we will present will be restricted to cabotage. It is not a question of a captain of a ship suddenly entering any old port without a pilot. That would make no sense from the point of view of safety. Rather we are talking about a captain who enters a port each week, who knows the port and who furthermore has authorisation, granted by the port authority itself, guaranteeing that he has the appropriate qualifications, knowledge and skills.</p>
<p class="contents">I am told we can continue to talk. We can always carry on talking. If I were to suddenly come up with some legislation without having spoken to anybody, then I would understand your concern. I have, however, been a Commissioner for five years and I have spent these five years talking to the port sectors on various occasions. And not just me, but also the Commission’s services have spent seven years since the Green Paper was approved, and beforehand during its preparation, speaking to the various bosses, players and protagonists in the European ports. So there have certainly been consultations and talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to earn my salary up until the last day and respond to the trust which you, this Parliament and the Council, have placed in me, and that means doing my job, which consists amongst other things of presenting this proposal for a Directive, if it is ready. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, the question concerns the conclusions drawn by the Commission in the light of that abolition of international textile quotas that will come into force as of 31 December of this year following a decision taken ten years ago at multilateral level by the World Trade Organisation. Ten years ago, we jointly set the date for the abolition of quotas for the end of this year. The day is almost upon us, and – understandably, even though we have had all the time we needed to prepare for it by means of progressive liberalisation - it has provoked a certain amount of anxiety, together with fears and difficulties to which the Commission has endeavoured to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall strategy that we have adopted consists of considering the European textiles and clothing sector, as the questioner himself has done, not as an industry of the past – whose gradual disappearance would have to be managed, more or less decently, from a social and political point of view – but, in sharp contrast, as an industry of the future. Textiles and clothing in Europe is a competitive, modern, innovative and productive industry. Europe is the continent in which there is no more modern and productive sector than that of textiles and clothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, the fact remains that finally abolishing the quotas presents us with a challenge in terms of competitiveness to which we must be capable of responding, and this is what the Commission did last June by proposing action lines. We worked on this matter with a high-level group representing the Commission, the Member States, various actors from the sector, producers, distributors and trades union representatives. I myself also took part personally in the group’s work, and a number of conclusions were reached.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, what we are proposing is firstly to start monitoring international trade – and in particular our imports – a little more closely. We shall therefore put in place at the end of this year a monitoring system in more or less real time, so that the figures – and, in particular, possible sudden rises in imports – can be spotted more easily, and we can draw our own conclusions as necessary, as the WTO entitles us to do. We shall also pay increased attention to questions of international competition and, in particular, to illegal practices such as dumping, fraud and the protection of intellectual property, each of which are, of course, cancers that must be monitored extremely closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element is conquering foreign markets. This, as far as we are concerned, remains the most effective weapon for ensuring the future of the sector, whether the markets concerned are major ones that remain protected, such as the US market in several cases, or potentially significant markets for us, namely a number of markets in some, but not all, developing countries which, in the textiles and clothing sector, are now potential importers of high added value products, including European products. This entire discussion, essentially focused on tariff issues and on non-tariff barriers, is the result of the Doha round of trade negotiations. We are therefore at the heart of these international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add a regional perspective to this multilateral work concerning the Euro-Mediterranean zone, on which we have been working with our partners from around the Mediterranean region, namely (and naturally enough) the countries of the Europe of 25, together with the candidate countries or potential candidate countries, such as Turkey. The idea is to set up a kind of pan-European integrated ‘textiles and clothing’ zone, with the help, for example, of accumulated benefits of pan-Euro-Mediterranean origin, about which we have been negotiating, up to and including this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a brief word about China, which is, of course, the most formidable competitor in this area, in view of that country’s efficiency, productivity and salary levels. We have set up a system of bilateral dialogue with the Chinese as regards the textile trade to look into ways of ensuring that trade is not disrupted too significantly as a result of quotas being abolished. In addition to this government-level and administration-level dialogue, we have set up a dialogue within European and Chinese business circles, and the first meeting in this connection took place recently.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these measures, which were fostered by the Commission’s initial communication last October and which were approached within the framework of this work done by the high-level working group, will be the subject of a fresh Commission communication, currently scheduled for October. We shall therefore approach the end of the year deadline in full knowledge of the facts, but also with a toolbox that has recently undergone significant improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once the quotas have disappeared, there will still be both the tariff level – which, as I have mentioned, is to be the subject of fresh multilateral negotiations, the principles of which, moreover, were set in Geneva last July – and everything we refer to as non-tariff barriers, in other words technical barriers that are also on the multilateral negotiation agenda. I am referring here to a series of technical measures as regards the composition of materials, protection against certain risks and specific characteristics that are imposed from time to time, in particular in the USA or in certain important developing countries, such as Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and India. These effectively amount to trade barriers which, under the pretext of protecting some specific local feature or other, have the effect of banning imports and protecting local producers.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole area of ‘non-tariff barriers’, of which I have just mentioned a few examples, falls within the framework of the multilateral negotiations that we have been pursuing in the Doha round, and what is true for textiles similarly applies to other sectors, such as the car and electronics sectors. This area of non-tariff barriers is therefore also part of the negotiations that we are pursuing within the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that textiles and clothing issues affect SMEs more than multinationals, hence his sensitivity on the issue. In my response to him, I shall add to my previous answer to the main questioner’s supplementary question by focusing on the only Singapore issue remaining, given that we had to let go – in any event for this round of negotiations and even if they do not leave the WTO’s table – of Singapore issues such as investment, competition, public procurement and public procurement transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">What remains, Mr Rübig, is a subject that is dear to you and that we decided in Geneva to negotiate formally this time, namely trade facilitation, which entails a complete review of some of the procedures, paperwork, authorisations, licences and administrative decisions that all too often still confront people as they take goods across borders. The entire issue of trade facilitation is currently under negotiation and, of all the Singapore issues, this was probably the most important one to the SMEs. I am therefore pleased that our schedule and Mr Rübig’s priorities have managed to coincide at this point. This was not the case, once again, for investment, competition and public procurement transparency, but what was most important for SMEs, and therefore for textiles – leaving aside tariff negotiation of technical barriers – was trade facilitation and, in this regard, your wishes have been granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the conclusions of the Irish Presidency Conference held in Dublin in May 2004 was that family and family life remain among the top sources of individual well-being. Therefore, they contribute to the social capital, although the Treaty does not provide legal competence to pursue family policy as such. However, given that the issue of family cuts across many different policy areas in which the Commission is active, it has already contributed to an evaluation of the interactions between various employment and social policies and the changing nature of families.</p>
<p class="contents">These interactions are already having an impact on European Union policies and will continue to do so in the future. For example, the objectives underpinning the Union's social inclusion process, the open method of coordination on poverty and social exclusion, stress the need to ensure access to housing, healthcare and education for all and to develop policies designed to preserve family solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The elimination of poverty amongst children is also emphasised. In this context, it is noteworthy that child and family poverty has gained increased prominence within the social inclusion process in recent times. For instance, one of the six key priorities agreed by the Commission and the Member States in the 2004 Joint Report on Social Inclusion is to develop a focus on eliminating poverty and social exclusion amongst children. Also, in the recent Commission Staff Working Paper on Social Inclusion in the New Member States, one of the key social inclusion challenges identified is to strengthen policies to support families and social networks, and to protect the rights of children.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important policy area in which the Commission gives prominence to the family is in its emphasis on developing family-friendly policies in such areas as employment and childcare.

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 33 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0229_EN.html">H-0229/04</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Problems concerning the transposition of Directive 1999/70/EC</span></p>
<p class="contents">Article 11 of Presidential Decree 164/19.07.04, bringing Greek legislation into line with Directive 1999/70/EC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, stipulates that workers wishing to convert to open-ended contracts must have completed 24 months of previous service, have had their contracts renewed at least once and have an 'active contract' on 19 July 2004 (date of publication) or three months prior to that date. This provision is in breach of Directive 1999/70/EC in that it applies only to those workers who complete the requisite period of previous employment midway through 2004. Both the extension of the deadline granted to Greece for transposition and the two-year delay in incorporating the directive into national law are, therefore, detrimental to workers' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter dated 13 February 2004, the Commission itself questioned the measures taken by the Greek Government to 'avoid abuse arising from the use of fixed-term contracts during the intervening period between the expiry of the deadline for transposition into national law and the entry into force of the Presidential Decree (81/2003). Will the Commission therefore say what measures it will take to eliminate the stipulated condition of an 'active contract', which is contrary to Directive 1999/70/EC? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive requires the Member States to take measures to:</p>
<p class="contents">one: improve the quality of fixed-term employment by ensuring the principle of non-discrimination is applied and</p>
<p class="contents">two: prevent the abuse caused by the use of successive fixed-term contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which the Member States achieve this depends a great deal on the Member States themselves. For example, they may define objective grounds which justify the renewal of such contracts, the maximum overall term of successive contracts and the maximum number of times such contracts may be renewed. There may be different solutions for different industries or for different categories of workers, provided the rules adopted suffice to prevent abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that this directive does not require Member States to take measures to convert fixed-term contracts to permanent contracts. Numerous countries have such rules within the framework of a package of measures to prevent abuse; however, the directive <span class="italic">per se</span> does not introduce the right for workers on fixed-term contracts to become permanent employees.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the new Greek presidential decree is concerned, article 10 on transitional arrangements makes provision for certain successive contracts to be converted to open-ended contracts of employment. However, as the Community directive does not order such conversion, the method and criteria used to achieve the number and categories of employment contract holders which it covers cannot be the subject of control by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first legislative act transposing the directive in Greece to which Mr Papadimoulis refers was indeed unsatisfactory as regards measures to prevent abuse from successive fixed-term contracts. The European Commission services and the Greek authorities liaised at the time so that solutions could be found more quickly and legal recourse avoided. Greece, as I mentioned earlier, has since passed a new presidential decree which changes the position in the previous presidential decree as far as the public sector is concerned. Apart from the conversion of certain fixed-term contracts to permanent jobs, the rule of thumb in the new presidential decree is that fixed-term contracts which exceed the maximum term of 24 months, as laid down in the presidential decree, are invalid <span class="italic">ipso jure </span>and may constitute grounds for payment of compensation to workers and the imposition of sanctions, including criminal sanctions, on employers.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission's preliminary examination, the rules for successive fixed-term contracts in the new decree do not contradict the directive on fixed-term employment. Nonetheless, given that the decree in question only covers the public sector, the situation also needs to be addressed in the private sector. As soon as Greece notifies the Commission of any additional relevant legislation transposing the directive, we shall ascertain if it complies with Community law and if it adopts the measures needed in each case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conversion terms for which provision is made in the presidential decree come within the jurisdiction of the Greek Government and any disputes which arise from the application of these terms may be resolved before the Greek courts.</p>
<p class="contents">The term whereby there must be an active contract for these people to whom you refer, and who were not recruited during the period in which the directive had not been transposed into Greek law, relates to the mechanism for converting contracts to open-ended contracts. The Commission does not therefore have jurisdiction to take measures to abolish this term, in that no such obligation to convert contracts derives from the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Papadimoulis correctly observed, the Commission raised questions in the past concerning the measures taken by the Greek Government in order to prevent abuse from the use of fixed-term contracts during the delay in transposing the directive into national law. The question to the Commission concerned the previous presidential decree which, on the one hand, was late in transposing the directive and, on the other hand, transposed it incorrectly. Had this situation not been corrected in the meantime under the new presidential decree, the Commission would in theory have been able to institute the proceedings for which provision is made in articles 226 and 228, the purpose of which is to proclaim that the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and to force it to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as Mr Papadimoulis referred to civil rights, the Commission could in fact take action against the Member State in the event of damage caused by late and incorrect transposition of a directive. The relevant case law exists for such action. In this way, citizens are protected from damage which they might sustain as a result of culpable and illegal delay in the transposition of a directive by a Member State, in which case the national courts have jurisdiction and may rule on compensation provided that, first, the Member State has engaged in illegal, infringing conduct, such as the delayed or incorrect transposition of a directive into national law and, secondly, there is a link of cause and effect between the Member State's conduct and the damage sustained.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the case under discussion is concerned, given that the new presidential decree does not appear to contradict the directive and, subject to completion of the Commission's process of examination, there are no measures which could be taken against Greece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
