<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, risk capital is essential for job creation, since between 80% and 90% of funds raised from venture capital goes towards hiring people. SMEs account for 66% of total employment in the Community, SMEs and start-up businesses and venture capital therefore need to have easy access to each other. Although European venture capital has grown rapidly, we still remain considerably behind the US.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I welcome the importance attached to the Lisbon Summit on venture capital. Although progress has been made, it is also less focused on the high growth and job creation sectors of information technology, biotechnology and healthcare. Coordinated action is needed and necessary at both EU and Member State levels in these areas. In order to achieve this, we need to create a regulatory environment conducive to risk capital. A number of regulatory measures need to be introduced. A directive on supplementary pension funds needs to be considered urgently and not put on the back burner; we also need an update on EU accountancy rules, a single prospectus for pan-European capital fundraising and the directive on late payment in commercial transactions needs to be implemented on time. Similarly, the reform of the European patent system seems absolutely essential in this area, as an early adoption of this directive is needed to create an online database to help SMEs check whether or not patents exist and how they can apply for them themselves. SMEs – foolishly perhaps – disregard the patenting system.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to lighten the administrative burden on SMEs, and measures to reduce the stigma on bankruptcy are long overdue because, although there is a wide range of funding instruments available, SMEs and entrepreneurs seeking funding for their new ventures continue to face difficulties. A website could be created to help overcome this at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be a review and rationalisation of Community instruments supporting risk capital. This needs to be more coherent and better integrated between the Commission, the Member States, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund. The EIB, the EIF and the European Commission also need to broaden their support for risk capital investment to a wider range of institutions and more innovative instruments, for example, business angels. Evidence in the US suggests that informal venture capital provided by such people is up to five times as much as with formal procedures. Similarly a Community-up approach to risk capital is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Risk capital investment needs to go out to everyone, to all regions and to all communities. Public authorities here as in elsewhere also have a key role to play in providing risk capital and financial support in areas where the private sector will fear to tread. Initiatives such as mentoring have helped in these areas. I praise the Prince's Trust in the United Kingdom for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the lack of entrepreneurial culture and insufficient human resources and training and the lack of high-tech SMEs are all factors which need to be addressed in order to develop risk capital. It is my belief that the EU has far more potential than is being realised at present. In order to unlock this potential we need to make changes, not only to the regulatory environment but also to the culture. It is essential that we realise the importance of risk capital to growth and employment and review the ways in which risk capital can be rationalised, simplified and made more accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, we need to take the measures which I have outlined and which have been outlined by the Commission and others in order to achieve a joined-up approach to raise the level of risk capital in the European Union and to extend the job-creating benefits to all parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the new amendments which have been resubmitted after the committee vote, I am not in favour of Mr Tannock's Amendment No 1, but I approve Amendments Nos 2 to 9. Of Amendments Nos 10 to 20, I only approve Amendments Nos 14, 17 and part of Amendment No 18.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the views of everyone in my committee and I believe we have a real consensus. I hope to maintain that by supporting the amendments I have just mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the shadow rapporteur for the EPP-DE Group on this matter in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Skinner who has been very successful in collating the views of parliamentary committees and political groups and putting them on paper in a harmonious and balanced manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In the communication on risk capital, the main political message was that risk capital is essential for job-creation, raising productivity and supporting growth in Europe. I would like to express this even more strongly than the Commission did. If we really want the European Union to achieve the ambitious goals of the Lisbon Summit, it is absolutely essential to improve the functioning of the single European risk capital market.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies in the European Union, especially in growth industries like the hi-tech and bio-tech industries, cannot achieve their full potential without better access to risk capital. Efficient venture capital markets are also a precondition for the development of entrepreneurship in Europe. In that sense I fully agree with Mr Skinner when he says that it is of the utmost importance to give SMEs open and fair access to the new risk capital markets.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a recent study mentioned in the Commission communication, this is also a very efficient tool for improving employment, since between 80 and 90% of funds raised from venture capital normally go towards hiring more people; in other words more risk capital allows us to use our human capital more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">In fighting unemployment, concrete measures to alleviate the tax pressure on labour are also urgently needed. I also want to emphasise the importance of reducing the costs and administrative procedures involved in setting up a company and getting back business after bankruptcy. At the moment there are too many possible entrepreneurs outside the economy, just because of inadequate insolvency rules. The present communication shows that even if some progress has been made Europe still has some major weaknesses, particularly when compared with its main competitors. Mr Skinner said that both the amount and allocation of risk capital remains sub-optimal compared to the United States, and unfortunately this overall gap is widening all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">That should make us a little worried about the timetable proposed by the Heads of State and Government in Lisbon. We should ask ourselves whether the deadline of 2003 is too late for Europe. I welcome the view put forward by Gordon Brown and others that we should think about accelerating the timetable, in both the risk capital action plan and the financial services action plan. We should at least make sure that some progress is made this year. I therefore totally support Parliament's view on point 23, calling on the Commission to keep us regularly informed about recent developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive on supplementary pension funds is essential for the growth of venture capital in Europe. The Employment and Social Committee wanted to make a reference to the findings of the recent report on supplementary pensions, particularly on the prudential rules. Institutional investors such as insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds play an increasingly predominant role in providing risk capital. Pension funds in particular have been gaining in importance in the last decade as the demographic changes increase the need for retirement products. The shift in favour of more performance-orientated instruments has also increased the need to reform the system.</p>
<p class="contents">The developments over the last few days with the single currency have been unfortunate. The euro will never be strong or attractive enough if the European economy is not strong and attractive. The risk capital action plan is one of the political choices we have already decided to make. Now we only have to make sure that we make it fast enough to use the current window of opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It covers all the key points as regards promoting a risk capital culture in Europe. This is particularly necessary given that efficient risk capital markets play a very important role in creating jobs on the one hand, and on the other, in increasing productivity, in financing rapidly growing companies and in creating new businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The report indicates that 66% of all jobs in the Community are in SMEs and that 80% to 90% of funding secured through venture capital is used to hire staff. We therefore need more capital for investment in job-creating, growth-intensive SMEs, and also for research and development and for business start-ups. These are the key points.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because we are way behind the United States in this field, we are also calling on the Member States and the Commission to support more money – that is more risk capital – to provide start-up capital and capital for the early part of a company's life.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>We want to cut down on red-tape: the one-stop shop model should be the rule in all countries, and we should take advantage of the new media here.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see a tax system which at the same time promotes innovation and encourages private individuals to invest capital in businesses. I therefore also welcome the agreement reached in Lisbon to introduce a benchmarking system so as to promote the best of the many ways of encouraging risk capital and to make further progress in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The acceleration in the pace of company growth, start-ups by highly innovative businesses and the terrific speed of industrial change all require more efficient risk capital markets. More support is needed for growth. Although there has been rapid growth in venture capital here over the last five years, Europe is still way behind the United States in this area, especially in the high-growth areas of information and biotechnology, and also in the area of health care, including preventive health care, a totally new field that is constantly growing.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, venture capital can be used to create modern social services, an area that should not be overlooked. These services will be particularly needed in the future because of the growing numbers of older people. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs took a special interest in types of supplementary pension funds and the prudential rules these require.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of increasing life expectancy, ever more new financial products are being created in the field of old-age pensions. This means that pension funds are playing an ever-greater role in providing risk capital. But social security systems, however they may be constructed, therefore particularly need special regulations and supervisory and codetermination bodies when it comes to funding, so as to strengthen confidence in these new systems and products. That is why it is also necessary for all interested parties – including the European Parliament, the social partners, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund – to participate in a continuing dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be said often enough that the European Union involves pooling our strengths. We must use all the financial instruments at our disposal to rapidly develop the market and to increase the volume of risk capital investment in the EU, so that risk capital is put to use in a way that genuinely creates jobs, thus benefiting all stakeholders. Investing in new business start-ups will also create jobs. If these are to be successfully built up, employees will have a key role to play and will act as a driving force. Employee participation systems linked with codetermination mechanisms therefore need to be in place. This is of vital importance for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to emphasise once again that the Commission communication, combined with the report, can potentially provide a strong impetus for combining forces in the risk capital sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has used various means to highlight the important role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating jobs and introducing technological innovations. However, this much-vaunted interest on the part of the Member States’ governments and the Community institutions is pure hypocrisy since, to all intents and purposes, small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to access funding programmes, unable to take advantage of technological invention and technological modernisation programmes, unable to take advantage of staff education and training programmes and unable to do anything about their unfair treatment at the hands of the tax authorities. These problems could be addressed by revising the banks’ humiliating lending criteria and by making full use of associations of enterprises and chambers which promote technological development programmes and school education programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s action programmes have done little along these lines; and yet, in the Commission’s announcement and Parliament’s report, here we are promoting options which are mainly of interest to big lenders and, more to the point, we are doing so on in the name of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is a public outrage to propose promoting a single European capital market, ostensibly to serve the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. The same applies to proposals for single European pension funds, to proposals that insurance fund reserves be channelled into high-risk financial investments and to tax cuts on profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, solving problems in connection with the unfair treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises by the tax authorities, simplifying and modernising patents and reducing excessive administrative expenditure and start-up formalities for small and medium-sized enterprises are steps in the right direction. But we consider that satisfying the demands of big lenders in the name of small and medium-sized enterprises is provocative and we shall vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development of the risk capital sector in Europe will mainly encourage small and medium-sized businesses to attract capital. This is a development to be welcomed as it is exactly this sector which has so much potential for creating employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the European Commission to bring the process of adopting the directive on additional pensions to a conclusion. Subject to rules of prudence, institutions must have complete freedom of investment. In addition, Member States must ensure that paid pension contributions are exempt from tax so that a new source of private capital can be tapped.</p>
<p class="contents">But the availability of capital is not the only threshold. Often, it is the infamous web of rules and regulations, red-tape and formalities which stop small businesses from taking on staff. Many Member States thus have the major task of setting structural reform in motion and taking down unnecessary barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the desired reform of the European patent system, I should like to bring the Commissioner’s attention to the European Patent Office’s trilingual system, which engenders distortion of competition. It should therefore be possible to submit an application in every official language of the Union. I believe that, without a doubt, the equal treatment of languages <span class="italic">de jure</span> is in the interests of small, innovative businesses and also complies with the EU Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern, expressed – rightly so, in my opinion – in Paragraph 22 of the motion for a resolution, relates to the possible patenting of natural materials, such as genes and plants. The principle that life is a gift of God and is not property acquired by people, should be respected at all times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who dares wins! Unfortunately, there are far too many European companies to which this expression does not apply. We may be good in terms of inventiveness, but we are bad when it comes to successfully putting our inventions into commercial practice. All too often, rights of exploitation go to American or Asian companies before SMEs in Europe have the courage to exploit inventions themselves. Young entrepreneurs in particular often have no idea how to obtain equity capital. Our tax and administration systems create special problems. These systems are far too complicated and are often incomprehensible, so that companies of this kind face frustrating obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore support all the calls for reform of tax systems and administrative structures. The present undesirable state of affairs needs to be changed as soon as possible, and the Austrian Government has already taken the initiative in this respect. Stamp duty on stock-exchange transactions has therefore been abolished with immediate effect and the tax allowance on employee share ownership has been doubled. It would be good if these measures could also be adopted by other governments instead of waiting until the EU requests them to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This of course also applies to encouraging SMEs and promoting entrepreneurialism. These are objectives that are repeatedly highlighted as being cornerstones, not only of our economic policy guidelines, but also of our employment policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed implementation of the action plan is the right way to go and is part of the structural reforms still needed in Europe despite all the progress made in implementing structural reforms in the markets for products, capital and services. But there is more to be done here. It is a good thing that this clearly emerged at both the Lisbon Summit and the employment forum. Above all it has also become apparent that the European Investment Bank will play an additional positive role. Mr Skinner was right to draw attention to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission communication also indicates, and this was also quite rightly taken on board in the report, that we have still not made sufficient progress in building an integrated pan-European risk capital market, and that this is a weak area for the EU. The figures speak for themselves. Risk capital investment in Europe has more than doubled over the last four years, but only EUR 7 billion was invested in Europe, compared with EUR 12 billion in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare investment during the start-up period of companies, the picture is even clearer, with EUR 1.6 billion in Europe against EUR 4.5 billion in the USA. Europe's equity markets for high-growth companies may have grown significantly, but in comparison with the US NASDAQ we are just dwarfs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the problems involved, but we are faced with obstacles that seriously stand in the way of our taking a risk-based and entrepreneurial approach. I have in mind not only cultural barriers, but also red tape, approval and licensing procedures, difficulties for SMEs in simply filing patent applications and having patents granted, not to mention the cost of maintaining patents, and also uncoordinated tax systems.</p>
<p class="contents">An entrepreneurial Europe needs rewards and opportunities which benefit everyone. So we must fully support the demands that have been made. There is also room for even more commitment. I would like to mention that expert networks also have an important and positive role to play. The provision of risk capital is an important area, but it is not the only issue in business start-ups and expansions: there is also the question of what working capital is available.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to stress that this is an area where women entrepreneurs should benefit from special support, and I wish to emphasise that we, the European Parliament, should be calling on the Commission to monitor progress in this field by means of benchmarking and a scoreboard process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree on many points, such as the provision of public and private risk capital, ways of making it more accessible, prioritising the availability of risk capital for SMEs, favourable tax treatment for ploughing back profits into risk capital funds, and simplifying and minimising the cost of patent applications.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the overall concept also gives rise to some criticisms. Firstly, if this is primarily about SMEs in underdeveloped regions, why is there such a sharp focus on innovative services? I would also like to see investment in new products in innovative manufacturing sectors as a means of promoting regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is no use having genuinely good intentions as regards investing in new business start-ups and in research and development, and pumping risk capital into these areas, if the process of opening up new markets, which is highly costly for SMEs, is not included. I say this because that is where SMEs face the greatest difficulties once they have a product – penetrating the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, why should public risk capital only be applied in areas which the private sector is reluctant to finance? It follows that this simply means keeping higher loss risks in the private sector and reserving high-profit areas for the private sector. This amounts to a distortion of competition which puts public risk capital at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, how can you guarantee that the greater involvement by pension funds in risk capital called for in the report may not lead to pension contributions being lost, which would run counter to the contributors' objective of ensuring a secure retirement?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, it remains unclear why mergers on the capital market should have a positive impact on the availability of risk capital. Experience suggests the opposite. The fewer suppliers there are, the less competition there is and the higher costs are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the European Union wishes to establish itself as the most economically dynamic region in the world, as was decided at the Lisbon Summit, it must ensure that investments, particularly in SMEs, which create jobs and which support growth sectors, are given the necessary funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to promote a dynamic spirit of entrepreneurship in Europe, but there are still countless difficulties blocking the path of people wanting to become entrepreneurs and to carry out profitable projects. The problems requiring rapid resolution throughout the European Union range from the administrative aspects, such as the often pointless bureaucracy which wastes time, energy and money, to the provision of funding. Venture capital companies have a major role to play in this field and the European Union must make more rapid progress if it wishes to catch up, in particular with the United States, which is currently far ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the Commission’s proposal is a step in the right direction, although I also think that we must move ahead more quickly, as stated in the amendment requesting the Commission to submit an action plan for 2000 in the field of risk capital and to adopt an integrated approach that combines all the Community instruments in a coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, Europe needs to focus increasingly on the merit of projects rather than on the personal wealth of entrepreneurs, as still happens. If the banks' practice of requiring personal guarantees from individuals is highly debatable, it is quite unacceptable where venture capital businesses are concerned. There is still a need to give entrepreneurs easier access to venture capital, and this requires much more active and efficient provision of information on the way in which it is used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The package of proposals just provides one more illustration of the fact that the European Union has been built exclusively in order to favour the movement and investment of large amounts of capital and, as a corollary, small amounts. Yet this concerns the majority of the population, as it is their money that the European institutions count on using in order to fund the measures to facilitate private investment. The people who do not own capital but who pay the bulk of taxes, largely through indirect taxes such as VAT, will therefore have to fund the subsidies and tax deductions envisaged for investors and the tax advantages granted to stock options. The plan is to favour pension funds, but that inevitably means favouring pay-as-you-go schemes. The money which ought to be used to provide a decent retirement pension for all will then be used to enable a minority to make greater private profits. We consequently refute, in its entirety, an approach designed to take even more money out of the pockets of the working classes that form the majority of the population in order to siphon it off towards holders of capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank Mr Skinner and Mrs Kauppi for their comments. Both clearly support the Community strategy for the development of risk capital in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a clear consensus on the important role to be played by risk capital as a driving force for economic growth and, consequently, for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know – some speakers have mentioned it – the European Council at Lisbon paid particular attention to promoting our efforts to implement risk capital in such a way that the action plan will be finished in 2003. Some of you have referred to the possibility of speeding it up. There is no doubt that this speeding up will depend on the Member States’ ability to implement certain measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember though that the action plan for risk capital predates Lisbon, since it dates back to 1998. However, past circumstances do not matter as much as what we intend to do for the future. In this respect, I would like to inform you that the Commission will be sending a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the progress made with regard to risk capital in accordance with the Lisbon objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication will include a mechanism for comparative monitoring and assessment to provide precise knowledge of what is happening in each of the Member States, and to allow us to draw relevant conclusions and to introduce, into those countries which consider it appropriate, the best practices which have been adopted in others.</p>
<p class="contents">An important factor that has been mentioned is the growth in risk capital during 1999. This is clearly essential. If we analyse the figures in absolute terms, we should be very satisfied with this result. Nevertheless, and some of you have highlighted this, when we compare it with the figure in the United States, we have to acknowledge that the difference is significant. Our fundamental objective must be to reduce these differences which still exist in comparison with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it is crucial that we carry out a range of concrete actions, and the first and most fundamental is the integration of the European Union’s risk capital market.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have referred to two specific examples which I would like to highlight – pension funds and the possibility of a more effective Community patent – which allow risk capital to be better used. As for pension funds, I will tell you that, this week in principle, the Commission should approve a proposal for a directive which offers pension funds greater opportunities to invest in securities throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are clearly talking about supplementary pension funds and not about an obligation to invest in this way. We are talking about removing the current obstacles and, therefore, there should be none of the problems you have mentioned with regard to future risks. Clearly, the opening up to risk capital will require scrupulous behaviour on the part of managers so as to minimise any possible risks.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Community patent, I simply wish to say that, back in July, the Commission approved its proposal on this issue. We believe that it is a fundamental instrument for reducing costs and safeguarding and increasing legal certainty in those innovative companies operating within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community patent will no doubt cause practical problems – some of you have mentioned such complex issues as the linguistic rules – but this is not, unfortunately, a problem which we can discuss at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these two specific issues must not lead us to forget other aspects which you have highlighted, such as the improvement of the economic, regulatory and legislative situation, which is essential if risk capital is to be as dynamic as it is in the United States. The regulatory, administrative and fiscal burdens of investments in risk capital are one of the obstacles in Europe and, in this respect, as in the field of cultural barriers, which certainly exist, the existence of that information, with a comparative situation in the various Member States, should give us more detailed knowledge of the good practices in each of the various Member States. We will thereby achieve better practical results which, in the end, will result in a speeding up of the use of risk capital in the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have mentioned the problem of public funding in the case of risk capital and we certainly have to clarify the compatibility of that public funding with all the legislation on competition. Some of you wondered why public funding had to be merely a supplement to private funding. This is not a desire to exclude anything, but simply a desire to use the available resources in the best way. It is not reasonable for public funding to compete with private funding when it comes to financing risk capital projects, and we should use that public funding for those types of project which are most difficult to finance through the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the Union itself, we are considering the best way to use the available instruments, especially the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund. Around the middle of October, the Commission will also publish a second communication, which we will send to the Council and Parliament, in which we will analyse the various financial instruments managed by the Commission and the future outlook on the essential issue of risk capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would say that I consider the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to be an excellent and important contribution, and it is enormously constructive, in terms of the efforts to develop the risk capital market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is satisfying to see that the recommendations of this committee largely coincide with our proposals for risk capital action plans, and I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the committee for participating in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe I have mentioned the two issues raised by Mr Skinner.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to speeding up the timetables, it falls to the Member States to take the necessary measures to implement the action plan. As for the Commission, we are now going to present the first report on what has been done, which will no doubt serve as an incentive for the Member States to act by comparing their actions with those of others. Given the Commission’s responsibilities, it is difficult for us to do any more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to pension funds, and I shall say this again for the record, the Commission intends to approve a regulation on them next Wednesday. We are therefore already speeding up the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
