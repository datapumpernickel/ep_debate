<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, in the last year, we have seen unprecedented developments in our southern neighbourhood. The European Union must therefore provide full support to these countries in their paths towards democracy and prosperity, not least through our trade and investment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, I had preparations stepped up for negotiations on deep and comprehensive free trade areas with the four WTO members undergoing democratic transition. We have also sought to maintain negotiations under older mandates, namely on agriculture, services and industrial standards.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />With the exception of services negotiations with Morocco, we did not advance far enough, but this was largely due to administrative changes on the other side, with transitional governments deploying resources to achieve other priorities. We did, however, manage to unblock the revision of pan-Euromed rules of origin between the EU, EFTA, Turkey, the Mediterranean and Western Balkans partners. We continue to push for a timely completion of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2011, the Council finally adopted negotiating directives for deep and comprehensive free trade areas with Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. The main objective of these future negotiations will be the progressive integration of the economies of these partners into the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">We have begun preparations for negotiations in March with Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan. We are ready to initiate negotiations as soon as the preparatory process is completed, based on an assessment of the commitment of each partner to long-lasting democratic and economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">As with eastern neighbourhood partners, negotiations will be subject to key recommendations by the Commission. These agreements will be comprehensive, covering a full range of regulatory areas of mutual interest such as trade facilitation, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property rights, public procurement and competition policy. They will also include provisions on investment protection and on further liberalisation of goods, services and establishment as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will take into account, in negotiations, the different economic situations and priorities of each partner country as well as their sensitivities. The Commission agrees on the need to enhance our trade relations on the basis of the more-for-more principle with countries where a deep and comprehensive FTA is not immediately possible, such as Libya, Lebanon or Algeria. The immediate priorities should be their accession to the World Trade Organisation, and contacts in this respect continue. With Libya, we also need to define the most appropriate trade framework for our relations. In all the actions undertaken, we will continue to encourage economic integration within the southern Mediterranean region, which is still poorer than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">An integrated Mediterranean market will be much more attractive for investors. We will continue to support efforts to reinforce the Agadir agreement between Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia and to extend it to other regulatory areas through trade and services, investments and public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">This also includes providing financial assistance and expertise to the members of the Agadir agreement, and we will continue to support industrial cooperation. Since 1995, we have been sharing knowledge and good practice in spurring entrepreneurship and improving the business and investment climates across the Euro-Mediterranean area. Industry ministers of the EU and the southern Mediterranean adopted the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise in 2004. This policy document provides guidelines for conducting reforms and promoting small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ as much as 25% of the workforce in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Commission will also invest in student mobility and academic exchanges. We put 743 additional Erasmus Mundus mobility grants at the disposal of southern Mediterranean students and academics for the 2011-2012 academic years, and there will be more of these in the coming years, including for the future Erasmus for All programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, the Arab Spring presents a major challenge for the EU in terms of accompanying our partners towards democracy and a market economy. This will not be an easy task – you are well aware of the complexity of trade and investment negotiations. We hope we can count on the European Parliament’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niccolò Rinaldi, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner – my dear friend. So, now is the time to give some practical responses to the Arab Spring.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has followed what has been happening on the opposite shore of the Mediterranean with enthusiasm. We have followed with enthusiasm, concern and a certain element of surprise what had happened and was happening during those months, and what is still happening with the difficult situations in Egypt, Libya especially, and of course Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes I – hesitantly – remember some of the statements by European foreign ministers who, not much more than a year ago, literally – and I remember this because it shows how far we have come – defined Gaddafi as an example of reformism for the rest of Africa, a statement made last February, and Syria as a country – and again I quote – capable of meeting its citizens’ need for modernity from its leadership. This is where we have come from. Another statement from February last year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, however, with the support and empathy of Europe, the Arab Spring eventually emerged with difficulty, and it was a marvellous change. What has happened in the southern Mediterranean has been extraordinary, and is also a reason for great hope, but naturally there are a lot of difficulties ahead. What help can we give as Europeans? What can we do in practical terms to try and make these people taking steps towards democracy understand that economic development also offers prospects for a better life?</p>
<p class="contents">We have two problems, among others. The first is that the potential for trade between the European Union and southern Mediterranean countries is definitely under-utilised. We are doing less than we could be doing. The report contains some figures, I will not quote them here, but given the geographical proximity and the fact that we all belong to a single area, Mediterranean Europe, the commercial policy figures are certainly rather unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that traditionally we – especially the southern Mediterranean countries – have structured our trade relations in such a way that trade with Europe mainly benefited an elite, an oligarchy which often managed the flows from this trade in an extremely exclusive, if not selfish manner. The Arab Spring is trying to liberate political processes, and subsequently we also need to liberate the economy, in order to ensure that those who want to become producers and players in a global economic and commercial process in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Libya and the other countries really can do so, and can have a direct dialogue with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means trying, also through a commercial policy, to provide practical help in a social situation that is sometimes desperate. In Egypt, revenues have fallen over 35% compared with during the Mubarak era. There is little investment, tourism is a resource that has almost run dry, and therefore we need new political tools, and here I think that in our work, we have proposed a series of practical elements to meet these expectations, and we will return to these in the final summary. Meanwhile, I would like to thank the Commission heartily for the constant support it has given me as well as the shadow rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of Europe’s missions is the well-being of its citizens, but also the concern for the well-being of citizens of other nations, especially those closest to us. The Arab Spring has changed the politics and economic structures of the Mediterranean area, and confirmed the strategic role of international trade as a tool – if correctly used – for marrying economic relations with the processes of democratisation and development of society. The development of trade and greater focus on small and medium-sized enterprises can lead immediately to a process of development and social well-being, which is useful for promoting greater stability and democracy in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of ‘more for more’ – more aid for more commitment – introduced by the Commission must become a market principle, because without more commitment on the part of the governments of these countries towards a real opening up of the markets and implementation of suitable economic reforms, it will not be possible to create an area where the market will be truly free and functioning, which is what we Europeans want. It is important that the European Central Bank does not make some of the same mistakes in the Mediterranean that it has made in Europe, especially as far as small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises are concerned, as these have an important role to play in the economic development of the area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Rinaldi because his report highlighted these points very carefully, and the focus on micro-enterprises and small enterprises represents a hope for stability, economic and also social progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main priority has been to provide the necessary support for the processes of democratic transition in those countries, with the aim of ensuring respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, equality and justice. In this context, trade relations take on an essential role and go hand in hand with the necessary political and institutional transition insofar as they provide resources for the economic and social development of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With adequate rules and conditions, trade can contribute to strengthening the EU’s links in the region and supporting the efforts to establish democracy. It is one of the EU’s responsibilities to ensure that all the elements of cooperation – in terms of both politics and trade; in short, two sides of the same coin – are well balanced and truly benefit the European citizens and the citizens of the southern shore of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report on Trade for Change, to which we are referring today, sets out measures and proposals to ensure that this objective is fulfilled. As has been said here and as the Commissioner has also said, the ‘more for more’ principle is an introduction and represents a crucial first step in this direction, and we are awaiting its coming to fruition as soon as possible through the European External Action Service (EEAS).</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention some elements which, in my view, are extremely important for this trade policy with the region: the effort to combat child labour and respect for international labour law; encouraging development niches for information and communication technology (ICT), which, in turn, would support young people – it is becoming ever clearer that young people are the main users of those technologies and this would serve in the fight against youth unemployment in the region; it should be remembered that the population of these countries between the ages of 10 and 19 represents 20%, while in the European Union it represents just 11%; – and, last but not least, promoting sustainable rural development that allows for the production of quality products in accordance with the traceability criteria and maintaining a fair trade balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rinaldi, on his good work and also for an excellent collaboration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in favour of the Commission’s decision to start negotiations on deep and comprehensive fair trade agreements with Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Jordan, whose aim is to remove the remaining tariff barriers on goods and agricultural products, address non-tariff barriers and expand the scope of the trade agreements, which should, in the long term, result in limiting poverty and promoting much sought-after peace and prosperity in the region. I also welcome the ‘more for more’ principle introduced by the Commission, but urge the European External Action Service to announce more quickly the criteria on the basis of which, along with the commercial scoping exercise, it will be decided whether a certain country meets the conditions for such an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This concerns small and medium-sized enterprises, which actually employ 25% of the workforce in the region. This strong role they play is a prerequisite for a successful trade strategy for the southern Mediterranean. This is why I endorse the call to provide reliable, accessible and easy to understand micro-credit schemes for these small and medium-sized enterprises. Provision should also be made for visa facilitation agreements for business people, in coordination with the trade negotiations and without unnecessary bureaucracy. I regret the fact that the civil societies in the southern Mediterranean countries still regard the European Union as not being active enough in its support of the reform process. This is why I believe that the trade agreements should be backed by tighter clauses on human rights, improved monitoring and implementation mechanisms, and an ambitious chapter on sustainable development.</p>

This was a policy which mostly focused on stability and on getting oil and other resources from autocratic or even dictatorial regimes. This has changed, and we, as Greens, were strongly in favour of the more formal approach that the Commission announced last year, making it clear that European policy in the future will not be about the exclusion of civil society, of women, or of groups that are not part of a ruling elite. It was clear, too, at that time, that the Commission said it would also focus on the economy and on trade.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, as Greens, the positive aspects of this report as negotiated in committee are the inclusion – and our thanks go to Mr Rinaldi and all the other shadow rapporteurs – of environmental issues, of sensitivities on the environment and ecology, and of the emphasis on social rights, with the provision that all social forces are to be included in negotiations for free trade agreements or indeed, deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs), on transparency, on the inclusion of civil society and on the importance of regional cooperation and the need to go through the Agadir Framework. Nevertheless, as Greens, we have some reservations about what FTAs and DCFTAs might mean in terms of the liberalisation of trade in a way that mostly serves the interests of the EU economy and big EU agricultural groups, without taking into account the interests and expectations of citizens in the southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rinaldi rightly said that, as Greens, we have certain reservations here, and we are demanding that the aspects of inclusiveness and transparency, now present in the report, must also be present on the Commission’s side when negotiations on agreements are being concluded. We would also prefer to see negotiations within the Agadir Framework, rather than bilateral negotiations, because we consider the regional approach to be more important.</p>

However, in all the countries with which we have free trade agreements, we have seen that a focus on agricultural exports in particular has led firstly to products not being produced primarily for local and regional markets and for local people, but instead for export, which has resulted in increased levels of poverty. Secondly, and this point is very important to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, far too little importance has been given to the question of human rights, participation in civil society and democratisation in these countries, even by the European Union.

This reminds me of Zhou Enlai, the famous former Chinese Prime Minister, when he was asked for his assessment of the French Revolution. He is said to have answered: ‘It is too early to tell’. Democracy may have taken root in Tunisia; there is more openness in Morocco; there are encouraging signs in Jordan. But what about Bahrain? What about Yemen? What about Egypt? What about Libya? It would be better to use slightly more cautious language.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also claims that trade is an effective means of consolidating democracy and promoting stability. Well, trade in itself is not an effective means of promoting democracy. It is important – no question about it, and we promote free trade – but trade alone can help dictatorships as well. Trade does not necessarily lead to democracy. We need trade to be supplemented with institutions, the rule of law, constitutionality, equal opportunities and support for small and medium-sized enterprises in order to channel the fruits of trade to a wider segment of society. For democracy to take root, there is a need for a middle class, which, in turn, can only flourish on broad-based economic growth – something which trade alone cannot guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls for the reconsideration of odious debt. I am only familiar with big debt and small debt, but not odious debt. I remember very well when the Berlin Wall fell.

But the history of revolution has, of course, more than one chapter, and the first chapter still has to be closed in many countries of the region such as Bahrain and Syria, while in Egypt and Tunisia, the revolution faces new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The new political leaders continue to ignore the interests of the majority of people in those countries, as the recent wave of repression against protestors demonstrates, vindicating the statement by Irish revolutionary Henry Joy McCracken in the 18th century, that the rich always betray the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States failed the people in North Africa and the Middle East through their political support and their economic ties with these brutal dictatorships. They will fail them again if they push ahead with the free trade agenda and the establishment of true market economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGO War on Want has explained that the creation of an EU-Mediterranean free trade area would cause the near collapse of manufacturing sectors in Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and a massive contraction in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Whether economic development and trade will deliver for, or will fail, the millions of people who overthrew the tyrants will depend on the nature of the economic and trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be an end to gambling and speculation on food prices, maximum prices on food and other basic goods, and guarantees of a decent return for farmers, in order to guarantee food sovereignty and food security for the countries of the southern Mediterranean. The debts inherited from the dictatorships are odious: they should all be cancelled immediately to give a breathing space so that economies can develop. In addition, the natural resources and major sources of economic wealth in these countries should be taken out of the hands of the multinational corporations and the rich, and taken into democratic public ownership for use as resources to invest in the economy, health care and education, in order to create a society worthy of the heroism shown by those who participated in the revolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practice, the Arab revolution has long since turned in many areas into an Islamic one. The Arab peoples are obviously often more interested in prosperity than they are in democracy. This is precisely what the Islamists, whose organisation extends into even the smallest rural villages, have promised.</p>
<p class="contents">Democratic values such as minority rights and human rights are something with which the Muslim Brotherhood is not familiar. Following their election successes, the Islamic parties have not only occupied key posts, but are also apparently now attempting to apply pressure on the people. Women, artists and minorities have emerged as the losers from the Arab Spring and the situation of Christians in the Arab world is a particular cause for concern. In Egypt, pressure is being exerted on the Copts and in Iraq, the exodus of the Christian minority has begun. There is also the fear of violence against Christians in a post-Assad Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in my opinion, EU development aid to the Arab Spring countries should definitely be linked to an obligation to protect Christian minorities. If these countries simply stand by and watch while Christians are discriminated against or even encourage discrimination of this kind, their subsidies must be reduced and, in extreme cases, stopped altogether. In addition, EU funding must be linked to readmission agreements for illegal immigrants. We must monitor carefully whether these countries are prepared to comply with the agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bokros has given us a very impressive description. We are at the start of a process and, unfortunately, there is a fear that, by the end of it, democracy will not be established in every country. Instead, it may be the case that Islamist groups will be in power in some of the countries. This is why I would like to see us making every effort to introduce improvements in these countries in the short term, so that the people there realise that democratic systems can genuinely help them and allow them to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kazak mentioned the question of micro-credits, among other things. I would also like to see us making progress in this area. The economy consists mainly of small companies and micro-enterprises and we are deluding ourselves if we believe that large firms will start to open new premises there. We will have to focus primarily on the small companies and micro-enterprises that already exist. If many of them can create one part-time or one full-time job and employ more people, this will allow the region to move forward. This is why I have great hopes of the micro-credits.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of investments as a whole, we must do everything we can to take the political dialogue with these countries forward. Money will only be invested when all the basic conditions are right, including democracy, the rule of law and legal certainty for the people who have made the investments. This is why we urgently need to intensify our dialogue over the next few months. To do this, we must have staff on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Gucht, there is only one external trade official in our office in Tunisia and there are no representatives of the Directorate-General for Trade in Jordan. This makes it clear that we must ensure in the short term that we have more people on the ground and that we perhaps need to discuss this with the Members of the Committee on Budgets in the context of the forthcoming budget debate.

<p class="contents">We need a change of pace and a return to the spirit of the Barcelona Declaration in order to overcome the fragmentation characterising trade relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries. Only a short-sighted view of the EU’s strategic role could consider that a policy of greater integration with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean contradicts the EU’s western vocation.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade governed by a balanced new free trade agreement could also represent an instrument of stability in a region criss-crossed by uprisings that have not yet perfected an approach to democracy, which also involves reducing inequality, strengthening production, better protection for civil and social rights, and commitment to avoiding Islamic fundamentalist tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this does not just depend on us, on the European Union. It also depends on the tremendous difficulties of cooperation and integration experienced by the countries on the southern shores. However, to paraphrase a great writer, if the Mediterranean becomes a project once again rather than a state of affairs, together we can overcome the current political and economic obstacles that have prevented a good agreement being reached in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an EU initiative towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to hold more in-depth talks about legislation with all countries in order to eliminate the excessive number of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and to open their markets up towards reciprocity, which means that a larger amount of aid must be tied to greater commitment on the part of our partners.</p>

It is essential that conditions are created for a strong middle class to emerge in the region.

However, the transitional governments that have emerged so far have mostly failed to live up to their laudable commitments to plurality, with Tunisia perhaps being the sole exception.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is a powerful trading bloc with a significant and proven ability to influence the conduct of governments through soft power. The EU should therefore use its exclusive competence in trade matters, and the fact that it is a significant aid donor with the ability to influence multilateral banking institutions such as the EIB and EBRD, to ensure that democracy and human rights are fully respected in our southern neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now considerable concern, with the election of some fundamentalist parties such as the Salafist al-Nour party in Egypt, which are insistent on introducing hard-line Sharia law into the constitution. This jeopardises women’s rights, homosexual rights, minority rights and, in particular, the rights of Coptic Christians, who will not only be discriminated against, but actively persecuted if this goes through. In such a case, if Egypt also wishes to unpick the Camp David Agreement, the peace treaty with Israel would also be in danger.</p>

As far as the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is concerned, this is too premature and should be preceded by a request to that effect. Can we really talk of an Arab Spring?</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to help you answer that question. In Tunisia, two bloggers have recently been sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment because of their atheist views. That same Tunisia is considering criminalising establishment of any relations with Israel and enshrining that in law.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the situation in Egypt is no better. It is estimated that, this year alone, 1 500 Coptic girls have been abducted, girls who have been circumcised and forced to convert to Islam. There is also the threat of the Islamic sharia being introduced in Egypt.</p>

Would anyone dare use these words in the presence of all those women, Christians and non-Muslims who are being oppressed? Instead of an Arab Spring, we are facing the threat of an Islamic Winter. I hope that my fellow Members have the courage to face up to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The rise of fundamentalist Islamic parties in the region is at odds with the values ​​we hold dear in Europe. We have to ensure that we do not make rash decisions about promoting trade relations with such regimes. If we do that, we will be sending out a totally wrong signal.</p>
<p class="contents">The message which the European Union needs to promote is that, as long as regimes continue to commit human rights violations or fail to act against them, we will not be prepared to extend relations with them. We owe that debt to the victims and the many vulnerable minorities in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has said, the amendments that have been presented, the human rights clause, democratisation, sustainability and corporate responsibility are essential conditions that all agreements should include, and although we are facing a new generation of trade agreements – which started with Morocco – within bilateral negotiation frameworks, we must recognise that there are certain sensitive areas, as is the case with agriculture, and that not all EU countries suffer the negative consequences that trade agreements can produce to the same extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are in favour of these trade agreements, and of this new generation of trade agreements, but we want this reciprocity clause, which must be present in all bilateral agreements, to be studied, we want impact studies and also, above all, we want studies on measures or instruments that divide the costs throughout the countries of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the problems arising within EU countries with regard to more sensitive areas such as agriculture, self-employed workers and small businesses should also be ironed out, particularly in the countries most affected by these issues within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it has become clear after a year that secular authoritarian regimes are being replaced by elected Islamic authoritarian regimes. This is a highly explosive and dangerous development, in particular, for the minorities in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The indicators of democracy are respect for human rights and also the treatment of minorities, including religious minorities. The Christians in these countries are in a drastic situation. An hour ago, there was a conference in this House organised by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. During the conference, it emerged in reference to a study carried out by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that 75% of the people killed in outbreaks of violence in these countries were Christians. That is not a coincidence. It is due to the Islamisation of these countries. The Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists regard Christians as their enemies and as part of the Western world. Of course, they fail to appreciate that in reality, the Christians are part of the Arab world. This fact is being ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to take into consideration that one condition of the agreement must be that these countries treat their Christian minorities differently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With many dictators deposed, we have a unique opportunity in the EU to engage with North Africa and the Middle East and to help create a true social market economy in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">On this, Schuman Day, may I remind the House of the origins of the social market economy. I believe it is time that we followed on from that Christian Democratic tradition and put ‘social’ back in the social market economy. We do not need to replace some dictators with others, whether they are capitalists or socialists or oligarchs controlling the markets and controlling the lives of people. What we need is a social market where people not only have rights and social justice but where they have responsibility and a sense of enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want social justice and the wealth that is needed to create the public services we want in these new countries that are looking for good governance, then you have to encourage the enterprising spirit to create that wealth – and I do want that social justice. I have looked at the failed system behind the Berlin Wall. The Berlin Wall days are gone! We are not going back to that system of protectionism where bully politicians control the lives of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at who some of those dictators were and who they were associated with in their international, political arrangement. I believe that with every right goes a responsibility; a responsibility for each other. People get up in this House and they preach about rights, constantly misleading people that somebody else can provide those rights or that somehow, by some magic formula, we in this House can – with our clay feet – legislate rights for people; but the responsibilities that go with them are not there. We have to insist not only on good governance in the Middle East and Northern Africa, but in this part of the world as well, where social market economy means that there is a true social market – not manipulated, not dictated, not politically controlled – and where social justice is at its centre and where people who, by the sweat of their brow, create wealth, are encouraged to be able to use that wealth for the good of the community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is the risk now that the wave of hope will be swamped by a vicious circle of poverty. The social upheaval is exacerbating the economic decline which, in turn, is swelling the ranks of the unemployed, especially among young people and women. According to the estimates from the Organisation for European Cooperation and Development, 25 million new jobs are needed in the next 10 years just to maintain the current level of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the experience of the transition made by the countries of Eastern Europe, I believe that this is an extremely tough objective to achieve. The aim of the Arab Spring was to obtain democratic freedom and a better life for ordinary people. The European Union has a direct interest in supporting these countries by undertaking an ambitious inter-regional commitment to update the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area project. In addition, the deployment of the trade and investment facilitation mechanism put forward in the Euro-Mediterranean trade road map and the establishment of the new rules of origin under the Pan-Euromed Convention may provide a significant boost to trade, especially at a time when the countries in the region will no longer be members of the Generalised System of Preferences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Compared with this new world that is trying to seek democracy and different economic conditions, our Europe is a Europe divided by the Mediterranean.

<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is a fishing area. We are building a new fisheries policy in Europe in which Europe will set some very strict rules. On the other side, however, there are no rules. Therefore, why not use forms of fisheries agreements, support for these countries so that they apply the same rules that are applied in Europe? This would be healthy for European fishing, healthy for the sea and environmental conservation, and would ensure that this division becomes ever smaller but an increasingly homogenous place on which to build the future of Europe and of this new world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU has to have an interest in the long-term stability and prosperity of the Arab countries that have undergone these major changes. Trade is one area that allows countries to improve partnerships and strengthen mutual trust. It is therefore necessary, alongside assistance with the development of democratic structures, to focus on a resumption of trade and economic cooperation between the EU and this region. We must provide effective help, in particular, with the renewal of economic structures – from small family producers to micro-enterprises to large companies employing local workers – as financial and economic self-sufficiency is essential if people are not to leave their countries and seek a future through economic migration. We must therefore make the necessary effort today and help not only with the political, but particularly with the economic, stabilisation of this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot carry on considering trade relations between the European Union and Mediterranean countries solely from the point of view of agriculture and, in fact, the report takes a totally different line. We asked for more connection with civil society, more study grants – and I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he said at the beginning on the development of the <span class="italic">Erasmus Mundus</span> programme – I believe – it is not an issue which concerns the DG Trade – but I believe that it would be useful also to have an <span class="italic">Erasmus Med</span>, something specifically for the Mediterranean countries, as a written declaration from Parliament had, in fact, requested.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for bilateral chambers of commerce between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries which do not yet exist. We are calling for new credit instruments, something – also through the work we have done with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) – is starting to happen, also for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and we are especially calling for liberalisation of this trade through the possibility of allowing new players and entities, like SMEs in fact, to emerge in southern Mediterranean countries. There is an extraordinary amount of talent in this area in the Arab countries that has always been suppressed by the oligarchies in power.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, technical cooperation to dismantle non-tariff barriers – all elements of our report – is crucial. Let us not miss this opportunity. We have the opportunity to use commercial policy, the exclusive competence of the European Union, to do a truly political job, part of which has still not been done, in order to support these processes.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who say that nothing has happened, that there have been no Arab Springs. I challenge anyone in this House eighteen months ago to imagine that Mubarak, Ben Ali and Gaddafi would have fallen from power in their countries in the space of a just a few months. Something has happened, and the development and outcome depend also on us, and also on commercial policy instruments, and I must just briefly say a word about the contribution of our Green friends who have just left us: do not have an ideological approach. It is not true that commerce is not good for development, quite the opposite. The report demonstrates all the rest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has a key role to play in promoting respect for human rights, pluralism, rule of law and social justice in the southern Mediterranean by stepping up not only political but also commercial cooperation with this region.</p>
<p class="contents">The unequal distribution of incomes, the lack of social and economic reforms and the precarious nature of the education systems and jobs were some of the main causes of the revolutions triggered in the Arab world. Support is needed from international financial institutions to aid these countries’ economic development and regional integration in terms of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">One important step towards this is the decision to extend the mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with the aim of taking part in the process of providing financial aid to the southern and eastern Mediterranean. In light of this, I would like to urge EU Member States to ratify the amendments to the EBRD Agreement urgently. The bank has the expertise required to ensure the transition to functioning democracy in the countries in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Arab Spring revealed some embarrassing structural and systemic shortcomings in EU policies dealing with the countries of North Africa and the Middle East. A new EU trade policy has to provide incentives for structural reforms, and also contributing to food and water security in the region. This will be the most effective means of convincing the people of the region that political democracy is the most efficient way to economic progress and justice. It is good that the report is very clear on the involvement of civil society in all social processes. I emphasise the need for the EU and its civil society to be proactive and work hand in hand with local civil society to assist and support their efforts. Only a pluralistic and vibrant civil society can bring about the change from within and ensure that democratic efforts are pursued. I remind the EU to be firm in its strive for trade and investments, making sure that economic relations are accompanied by achievements and real results in respect of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Economic liberalisation and democratisation need to be complementary and simultaneous to each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since January 2011, a lot of these investments have been transferred to other countries which were considered more politically stable, such as Turkey. The EU shares responsibility for this. Indeed, the slowness of its reaction and the lack of political will and coherence resulted in investors’ lack of confidence. Depending on the country, the post-Arab spring political situation is taking more or less time to stabilise, but we can be confident at this stage that the southern Mediterranean countries will find a way towards democracy. We should encourage this transition by boosting public and private investments in the region, through the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership, with emphasis placed on SMEs. That the EU manages to send the right signals at the right time is crucial. This is not just a matter of economics; this will define its credibility in a region where half the population is under 25 and which promises to be increasingly dynamic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would add, however, that the economic integration that the EU advocates and wants to develop should, first and foremost, focus on South-South economic integration. The Commission, in its communications, considers that economic integration requires integration into the European market. In my view, this is only a second step: once the markets in southern countries have integrated among themselves, and once the EU has helped them to adapt to its technical and health standards, then access to the internal European market will be of real interest and will have a concrete impact on southern economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the rapporteur’s idea to analyse, by means of impact studies, the effects of European trade policy on the economic systems of these countries. Such a study will allow for a rapid adjustment of European measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
