<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Malangré </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this own‐initiative report is Parliament"s contribution towards closing a very sensitive loophole in internal market legislation. Much of this single market legislation is, as we know, very well advanced, I am glad to say. However, despite three attempts we have still not succeeded in finding a solution to the problem of Community insolvency law. This is the unavoidable downside to the great success of the single market. As we know and are extremely happy to see, many businesses are taking advantage of the single market to operate in other countries and now have sizeable assets in various Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When insolvencies occur, however, the confusing legal situation with, at present, 15 different bankruptcy systems creates great scope for manipulation, generates enormous costs in complicated proceedings and makes it extremely difficult to ensure that the assets are fairly distributed among the creditors. Here too – and this is something we would stress – the idea of introducing remedial measures through an intergovernmental agreement, thereby excluding Parliament, came to nothing. However, I will not deny that I have great sympathy with what the Commission has been trying to do since the early 1980s, or at least with the substance, but not with the idea of using an intergovernmental agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission draft was an outstanding and extremely knowledgeable legal text, but it was not accepted. The subsequent attempts – the Istanbul Convention and the last one that failed in 1995 – tried other routes, but they too missed the mark. Nevertheless, we need a Community solution, which is why I call in my report for a draft directive or regulation to be put forward as soon as possible. We urgently need to have this on the table, and most of the preliminary work was done in the three earlier drafts. If we take the approach of demanding directives or regulations, we are ensuring that Parliament will be involved and that there will be a majority decision, which experience has shown to be clearly what is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">My report contains a number of proposals which improve on the agreement that failed in 1995, and we would ask you to consider them. I think they are essential improvements which can be incorporated. I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for all its hard work. We held a hearing that produced a very clear outcome, and we were unanimous in demanding an urgent solution to this insolvency problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just mention that four amendments were tabled in committee which were all positive and supported the line taken in the report. I was therefore happy to include them and can now put before you a proposal that was approved by the entire committee. I would urge you to vote in favour of it tomorrow.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oddy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Thank you Mr President. I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important report and I agree with his suggestions. I regret, too, that the convention has not been ratified by all Member States and would stress that we need to find a solution to this very serious problem. I agree with the demand of the rapporteur to draft a regulation or a directive on crossborder insolvency.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to flag up though that we need a solution which finds a fair balance for creditors and employers and employees alike. Employees need some protection for accrued salaries and creditors need a sensible solution which will give them the best possible repayments of debts under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also flag up a point made by my colleague, Mr Falconer: I am sure he will not mind me saying this. He is particularly concerned that, in insolvency situations where someone later develops an industrial disease, a solution is found whereby they can be recompensed for industrial disease problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that this is an urgent report and that it is crucial to find a solution swiftly. Indeed, to show how urgent it is, I was lobbied about this at an international banking meeting in Paris in spring 1994. That shows how longstanding the issue is.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group. My Socialist Group will be supporting the report and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work. It has been extremely nice working with Mr Malangré over the years that we have both been in Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wijsenbeek </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin where the previous speaker left off, by expressing my great admiration for Mr Malangré. He has produced a report that is as sound as a bell. I myself have a personal connection with this subject, since my very first report, on an amendment to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, dealt with the bankruptcy of the Ferrovie San"Anna, which was very unusual at the time, a steel company going bankrupt. The High Authority, which was responsible for the social side of things, seemed to come last in the queue, while first the State, then the social services, the suppliers, the banks and anyone else you cared to mention all helped themselves to whatever was left over from the liquidation. So I said to Commissioner Cristoffersen that the situation could not be allowed to continue, because there were so many different bankruptcy systems in the European Union, and it was high time that we had the possibility of creating European limited companies whose creation and termination would both be jointly regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in my last speech at the last sitting I shall attend as a Member of this Parliament, bankruptcy is on the agenda again and it has still not been regulated. As Mr Malangré described in his explanatory statement, which as I said is absolutely first‐class, it is high time that we did something about bankruptcy in the Community at European level. There are twelve different systems for suspension of payment in Italy, and in Denmark all creditors are treated equally, even the State and the social security authorities. We need harmonisation here, otherwise any attempts to create European transfrontier companies will be doomed to failure. I support the Malangré report, to which I have been able to make a small contribution through my amendments in the Legal Affairs Committee, which have been included. I and my group wholeheartedly endorse it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament"s initiative to support the adoption at Community level of legislation that allows us to determine the legal and economic effects of the bankruptcy of companies operating within the internal market. Such legislation does not currently exist. The effects of insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State upon goods and people situated in another Member State depend on national legislation and on bilateral agreements between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has always attempted to compensate for this shortcoming in the context of the smooth running of the internal market and, to this end, it launched two types of initiative in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Member States began to negotiate an agreement on the basis of ex Article 220 of the EC Treaty. This agreement aimed to regulate in a horizontal manner the intra‐Community effects of bankruptcy by determining the legal competences and the law to be applied in declaring a business insolvent. These negotiations culminated in the signing of the 1995 Convention on Insolvency Proceedings, on the basis of which we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission presented two directives on the liquidation of insurance companies and credit bodies. These proposals are based on the principle of the authorities" powers in the country of origin where these companies are authorised to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes that the two directives will be adopted as soon as possible. Until now, however, neither of these two initiatives have been successful. We are awaiting their adoption with bated breath.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 Convention on Insolvency Proceedings had still not been signed by all the Member States before the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force and, as a result, it cannot be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Retaining its use of the right of initiative, the Commission is assessing how the text agreed by the Member States in 1995 and could be brought into effect within the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
