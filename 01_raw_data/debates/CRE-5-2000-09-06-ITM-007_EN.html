<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the Community telecommunications market reached a climax in 1998 with the full liberalisation of services and infrastructures in the majority of European Union countries. This contributed significantly to a boom in our economies, to the lowering of prices – by up to 35% – to the arrival of a large number of new operators and to the constant introduction of innovative services. This, of course, resulted in substantial benefits for the consumer and for workers as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The expansion of the telecommunications and Internet sectors is creating large numbers of new jobs both within those sectors and in other sectors, and bringing an increase in efficiency. Over 500 000 jobs have been created in the mobile telephony sector alone over the last five years.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2000, the Commission proposed a new package on electronic communications, which particularly stresses the need to facilitate high-speed Internet access – while keeping costs down – and to develop a legislative framework which is not too burdensome for operators in the sector. However, part of the Commission's task is to ensure that the benefits generated by competition are not lost and that there are no barriers to innovation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibilities for Commission intervention in the field of competition policy are clearly defined by Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty and by the merger regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now look at mergers, which are the direct result of demand. There has been an increase in mergers in the telecommunications sector in recent years and this trend looks set to continue. At the moment, there appears to be a shift on the European market from consolidation operations to convergence operations, and this is borne out by the alliances recently examined by the Commission, such as the Vodaphone-Vivendi deal, and those which are currently under examination, such as the merger between America On Line and Time Warner.</p>
<p class="contents">.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapid rate of technological development has also generated an increase in cooperation between the different sectors and boosted convergence. Globalisation has prompted many companies to expand in an effort to be competitive on world markets. These include the mobile telephony group, Vodaphone, the recent take-over of Global One and Orange by France Telecom<span class="bold">, </span>the combining of the AT&amp;T and BT international activity in the company Concert, and the proposed take-over of Voice Stream in the United States by Deutsche Telekom. All these changes are positive from the point of view of competition, for they characterise opening-up of the markets, they increase the companies' efficiency and they lead, amongst other things, to the creation of a genuine single market in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the telecommunications sector, the Commission must ensure that the operations under consideration do not detract from the benefits of liberalisation and that they do not restrict the innovation flow, as could happen, for example, were an operator to gain control of a new market. In this regard, Mr President, I would like, very briefly, to illustrate these two risks and the action which the Commission intends to take to avert them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take as an example the issue of maintaining open national markets. One of the first decisions taken by the present Commission on the subject of mergers was to authorise the merger of the Swedish company, Thelia, and the Norwegian company, Telenord, last autumn, subject to certain conditions. The merger was subsequently abandoned by the parties in question but the conditions imposed by the Commission nevertheless served as evidence of its intention to protect the liberalisation of national markets from concentrations of dominating carriers. I do not have the time to go into the conditions imposed by the Commission in detail now, but they are available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch upon another major risk which we must combat, preventing operators using mergers to gain control of innovation and the new markets. Here are two major examples: firstly the proposed Worldcom and Sprint merger. On 28 June last, the Commission refused to allow the merger between two US companies, Worldcom and Sprint. Combining the extensive Internet networks and the vast client bases of Worldcom and Sprint would have produced such a large company that the new company would have been in a position to dictate the conditions of access to its Internet networks and its clients, which would have been to the detriment of the client and created barriers to innovation. I regret that, unfortunately, there is not enough time for me to go into details here.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example of action taken to avert the risk of an operator gaining control of innovation is that of the Vodaphone/Mannesmann decisions and, subsequently, the Vodaphone/Vivendi/Canal Plus decisions. The Commission had to assess the implications of the mergers on the emerging markets and authorised the parties to go ahead in both cases during the initial stages, once they had proposed to abide by a limited number of commitments. The commitments are intended to maintain competition in the newly emerging markets in addition to resolving the classic situations generated by the combining<span class="bold"> </span>of market shares<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Vodaphone/Mannesmann operation caused problems on the emerging pan-European market of seamless mobile telephony services for multinationals. In order to eliminate these competition problems, Vodaphone proposed to allow non-discriminatory access to its integrated network and allow competitors to provide similar services during the period in which they were developing their own networks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to ensure that competitors did not just take advantage of a company which was the product of a merger without developing their own services autonomously, the Commission limited the duration of the undertaking to a period of three years.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly afterwards, the Commission had to examine the case of <span class="italic">Vis-à-vis</span>, the joint venture made up of Vodaphone and Attach, Vivendi and Canal Plus, to develop an Internet access portal. <span class="italic">Vis-à-vis </span>was going to produce a multiple-access Internet portal for the whole of Europe, providing the clients of the companies involved with the choice of a range of Web services accessible through the clients' PCs, mobile phones or set top boxes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's study revealed that the joint venture would have caused problems for the emerging national TV Internet access<span class="bold"> </span>markets and the emerging national and pan-European mobile phone Internet access markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to eliminate these problems, the parties undertook to ensure that the clients of the companies making up the joint venture were able to choose other portals and would not necessarily have to use a particular company's portal to connect to the Internet. This undertaking supplemented the undertaking proposed in the previous case, the Vodaphone/Mannesmann case, which I have just described.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as the examples of the cases of which I have just given a brief outline show, Community competition law plays a crucial role in ensuring that the benefits of liberalisation and innovation do, in effect, filter down to the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of Community rules on merger control is to prevent the creation or consolidation of dominant positions, which would hold back technological and economic progress, and to ensure that the European Union consumers are able to benefit from this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have learned from the experience of these initial years of liberalisation and careful control<span class="bold"> </span>to preserve competition, workers are also among those who benefit, as shown by the figure I gave just now as an example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to briefly pick up on some of the crucial points that he made. It is quite clear to all of us that the whole world of electronic communications is presenting us with a regulatory challenge, but it is clearly presenting you, Commissioner, and the competition authority with unprecedented challenges, given the speed with which technology is advancing. Many of the ideas related to market share are also changing very rapidly. In the telecom field, it is clear that market share can change hands much more quickly than in some of the major industries that have been regulated in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that your approach is to try and avoid putting a brake on innovation by excessively firm controls. That is extremely important. I would like your assurance that you will be developing the expert capability to what is undoubtedly going to be an increasing workload in looking at future mergers.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand from the Peers Group report that you are going to be awarded an extra 92 posts. It will be interesting to hear how you envisage your service developing in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which will come through in our consideration of the telecom package, is that in this very fast-moving world there is concern within the industry and amongst investors that excessively rigid targets in terms of market share thresholds for investigation – and that can be too much or too little in many cases – should not be allowed to inhibit your consideration of areas where there is a genuine competitive issue at stake. Could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly to thank him and his officials for trying to see trade unionists from all over the European Union and indeed from the United States of America, who had an opportunity to put their views.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, one of the consequences of mergers and takeovers is the effect on employment and I know that the Commissioner, within the confines of the Treaty, is sensitive to this. What also needs to be stressed is that there are special technological reasons why a concentration of ownership, the potential abuse of a dominant position, is so serious. In most other industries such a concentration or potential abuse might be temporary, but in this field if any one company does secure such a strong position it will almost certainly have it, if not forever, then at least for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">In your presentation, Commissioner, you mentioned the danger of one company gaining control over these markets. This really is a dilemma for Parliament and for the Commission. We accept the near inevitability and in many cases the desirability of mergers and takeovers, but we also see the potential and actual dangers. Parliament is consistent in its view that we do not want to put any obstacles in the way of competitiveness and innovation. We welcome the position that you have taken on this particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">One other small point: much of this competition is between the European Union and the United States of America. I know you are well aware how crucial it is for Europe to lead in the two important spheres of third generation mobile telephones and digital television and I hope that you will continue your efforts to keep that lead, which is so crucial to jobs, employment and prosperity in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This seems an ironic lurch towards a protectionist position at the very time when here in Europe and in this Parliament we are about to embark upon a debate on the latest raft of measures which, in my view, would make the European Union telecoms market the most liberalised and the most open market in the world going way beyond many if not all of the commitments into which we entered in GATT and the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">This is politically if not technically an unbalanced situation which merits the attention of this House. Whilst I have some philosophical sympathy with Senator Hollings and his colleagues who consider that state-owned companies have some hidden and sometimes explicit advantages over their privately-owned competitors, the way in which Congress in the United States is trying to address this issue is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of US multilateral commitments. I would ask fellow Members, when considering the latest raft of telecoms measures in the weeks to come, not to allow this to go unnoticed or for that matter unchallenged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, comparisons were made. In the United States, 40% of homes had access to that network of all networks known as the Internet, whilst in the European Union, that figure hardly reached 20%, and that percentage was only surpassed in a few of the Union’s Member States, which were more advanced in terms of technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need to make progress and take more action specifically on that issue. We must not have two types of society, second- and first-class citizens, those who are technologically advanced and those who are technologically backward. We must provide all citizens with access to this new information society. However, as we make more effort in terms of the concentration of companies and of developing the European market, we must take account of the dangers caused by a lack of security in telecommunications. I am thinking of the Echelon affair, which is very much related to this kind of issue. In Europe, we must ensure that there is security, because that is a human right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Internet must continue to be a means of communication for all. We must therefore prevent the telecommunications and media giants from being able to occupy a dominant position. Competition law is an effective tool to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">However, mergers also have an impact on employment and social cohesion. Telecommunications and media are not crisis-ridden industries; they are an expanding sector. Objectively, this makes it easier to take account of sociopolitical and employment policy aspects in merger decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the mid-nineties, the Federal Communication Commission in the USA has, in the case of several merger decisions, secured commitments from the companies concerned to increase the number of employees, improve quality of service, and do more to look after the public interest. Therefore we fail to comprehend why, in the welfare state of Europe, competition law should rule the day. We are calling for the EU to introduce binding social clauses into the mergers approvals process.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the competition law test, we need additional criteria for the purposes of merger decisions, for example: firstly, the companies should give a binding commitment to preserving or raising the level of employment. Secondly, they should improve the quality of service for large sections of their customer base. Thirdly, they must implement to the letter, the mechanics of the European social dialogue and the provisions of the directive on informing and consulting workers, as they make the transition to the new merged company. Fourthly, the merger must bring added benefits when it comes to furthering the public interest. This relates to such matters as the need to safeguard a comprehensive and modern universal service, and requirements in terms of data and consumer protection. That is the only way to guarantee that competition policy will also strengthen the European social model in the new economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is part of the ongoing framework programme to improve the quality of telecommunications services in Europe. Parliament and the Commission are right to be adamant that the Union must improve its telecommunications network. It is fair to say that the United States is possibly three years ahead of the Union as regards the use of the Internet. On the back of the new directives which are being enacted in the telecom sector, the European Union will catch up with the US sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also in line with the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Portugal. EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services. I support the recommendation that all schools in Europe must be equipped with the Internet. From an Irish perspective, I am particularly satisfied that this programme is advancing at a very swift pace.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much talk in national and international media about the auctioning of third-generation mobile phone licences in Europe. Certainly, the auctioning of these licences in Germany and Britain has secured large amounts of money for the respective national exchequers, but who ultimately is going to pay for these phones? I strongly believe that consumers, once again, are going to be forced to bear the high cost of these licences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These cases have increased dramatically in number recently. In ten years the number of mergers has risen fivefold and there are about three hundred of them a year now. Mr Harbour presented the telecom package. It just shows what a furious pace this industry is moving along at. It demands a lot from all of us in terms of skills.</p>
<p class="contents">The telecommunications and IT sectors are special. It is not just a matter of pushing a cart; it is a quite exceptional field, because information is at present the most important tool of production. In addition, it involves, as we know very well from the Echelon case and others, the possibility of monitoring, and thus the possibility of the monitoring of people, which has also become a very important business. The other aspect to consider here is globalisation, which crosses state and cultural borders. These are in a way beyond the control and vigilance of everyone. Quite the opposite, as through them these companies can create a dependency, as that part of this business happens in people’s brains. It is an important new territorial conquest, and, for that reason, I would ask the Commission to be particularly careful with regard to these mergers. While we are aiming at deregulation here, Commissioner, companies are tending to re-regulate: to make new agreements about the market that bypass the democratic monitoring and control systems. As Mr Clegg said, there are obviously problems too between the European Union and the United States, such as the restriction on mergers in the case of Deutsche Telecom, which obviously has to be looked into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we apply this to the issue in question, the telecommunications sector, it is a well-founded concern given the cases which arose in Spain, a few months ago, involving the merger of Telefónica with a Dutch company, in Portugal and in other sectors in France. It worries us that there is still government interference in the actions of companies who are seeking appropriate dimensions and competitiveness at a European level.

These operations involve billions of dollars, and benefit consumers, who are also employees facing company closures, relocations and redundancies. The telecommunications sector has become a symbol of capitalist globalisation, which forces it to bear the cost of this race towards ever more enormous deals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Summit made several references to the information society. This is something which can indeed enable considerable progress to be made. There is no doubting that this is a challenge! Nowadays these changes are generally matched by a dismantling of social rights, an increase in part-time work and flexibility at work. Nor can we ignore the consequences for the freedom of information, cultural diversity and public services. The Commission banned the merger between MC Worldcom and Sprint solely because it might threaten free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time, however, when the European Union is making employment a priority, mergers should also be seen in light of their consequences for employment and land-use planning. We should also increase the employees’ and union organisations’ rights and powers on the boards of European companies and perhaps even give them a right of veto in the event of restructurings or mergers. Lastly, common regulations should be promoted so that the information society benefits all citizens and is based on equality of access, freedom of information and cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all appreciate the importance of your task in the competition department of the Commission. It is perhaps the most important task of the Commission to maintain free competition and make the market work across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the telecoms context it is vital to ensure that consumers get all the benefits the free market can offer them, particularly the low-cost Internet access. The way to deliver that low-cost Internet access, vitally important for the creation of a European E-economy to the people of Europe, is through liberalisation and free competition. We used to regulate the telecom sector through national regulators, but these will wither away in future because we are moving towards a single, global regulator, namely the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is the most effective regulator, providing the best protection for consumers and giving consumers more power than any number of Commission consultation groups. In future we shall want to give the competition mergers department, more work, because the market should play an even bigger role in telecoms than it does at the moment. We want to see an end to the advantages inherited by some of the old state monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will apply competition law and merger law toughly, but always ensure that you look at each merger on its own merits. Just because it may produce a big player or a big corporation it is not necessarily wrong for the market or anti-competitive. We have to remember that Europe probably will need some large corporations if it is to reap the benefits of the Internet revolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is simply not the case that the workers in our regions and constituencies are forever waiting with bated breath for us to liberalise previously protected sectors. The reverse is often true.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to have to answer a whole host of employees’ questions about local public transport operatives over the next few weeks and months. We, the representatives of the people, must provide these answers, and not the Commission, which will talk to the union leaders if need be. One thing is for sure, unrestricted liberalisation and the opening up of markets, are no panacea. However, market opening in the telecommunications sector itself, demonstrates that market opening can bring benefits for consumers in the form of falling prices and access to new services. It has brought about rapid advances in technology, which, at the end of the day, will lead to an increase in jobs, even high-quality jobs in the major sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The globalisation of our national economies has had a major stimulating effect on the liberalisation of telecommunications markets in Europe, and, conversely, has furthered development at international level. It goes without saying that we need a certain number of commercial giants to be able to hold our own as a global player. But this must not of course lead to new monopolies in markets and market sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to adopt a rigorous competition policy with regard to commercial organisations, in order to ensure that no single company gains a dominant hold in the new market block formed by the telecommunications and multimedia sectors. That is why we should support the Commission’s decision in matters such as WorldCom and Sprint. We also hope that it will adopt a similarly rigorous approach where Time Warner and AOL are concerned. Above all, though, the Commission must use its efforts to modernise competition law, particularly in respect of the regulation on merger control, as an opportunity to adopt an extremely rigorous approach to its reform undertakings too. We hope this will not prove to be to the detriment of competition policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of overall benefit to society that an operational environment should be created in Europe, in which companies, that is to say, the private sector, are themselves able to attend to these infrastructure projects that vitally need the information society. As these same companies at the same time employ more and more people, as we heard today in your presentation, Mr Monti, and are therefore boosting economic growth in Europe, I do not really understand the fears that have been expressed over there at the other side of the Chamber that these mergers, which are fully beneficial to society as a whole, should have a detrimental effect on employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians and trust busters, such as Mr Monti, must not interfere in this current development in the market other than when the Commission has proper grounds to believe that a particular merger may cause distortions to the competition situation, so harming the interests of consumers. Mr Rapkay, you may be sure that nobody in this Chamber wants monopolies or oligopolies in the market. This must really be restricted to certain cases; in other words, we need logic and consistency in this. On the other hand, the Commission must actively monitor whether free access to markets is being realised in all sectors, as stated in point 3 of Parliament’s joint motion for a resolution. Global competition must be examined, and there have been problems recently, at least with regard to the Deutsche Telekom – Voice Stream deal.

We are beginning to form ideas about how to deploy additional resources within the competition DG but we must first secure the support of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Read, among others, supported the decision we took in late June about MCI WorldCom-Sprint. That decision was based on a great many considerations, including some input from the trade unions, although this in no way led us to depart from regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Read and other Members of Parliament mentioned some sectors in which Europe has a lead, for instance third-generation mobile telephony and digital TV. One particularly effective way to maintain a lead is to make the market run efficiently. That is why we insist so much on rigorous enforcement of competition policy in the light of the market situation in Europe, irrespective of the nationality of companies. When companies establish or consolidate a dominant position without proposing the necessary remedies, we have no option but to block a merger and recently did so in a case involving two European companies, Volvo and Scania, which, indeed, are based in the same Member State. We would have done the same in another case in which one company was European (Pechiney) and the other North American-Canadian (Alcan), but the merger was withdrawn. In addition, we took similar action in the recent MCI WorldCom-Sprint case, where both companies were American. We have established excellent cooperation with our American counterparts at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of the US, several Members have drawn attention to the risks of the Hollings Bill. This is simply a proposal, and I hope that it will not become law, although this depends on your American opposite numbers. However, if it were to be adopted I would consider it a disturbing sign of protectionism It would be unfortunate if liberalisation, which has taken such giant leaps forward in the US, Europe and elsewhere over the past few years, were to start going backwards in the US. Moreover, the bill is, in our view, clearly incompatible with the USA's WTO obligations and other basic telecommunications agreements and the Commission through my colleague Pascal Lamy has certainly made this very clear to our American counterparts. The Commission also resolutely opposes any such legislation in our Member States. To dispel Mr Gasòliba i Böhm's anxieties, the Commission alone has the power to consider Community-scale mergers. When a Member State wrongfully intervenes, the Commission is ready to challenge such an intervention, as it proved in one case last year in a decision addressed to the Portuguese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Mr Markov and Mr Rapkay referred to the very important AOL-Time Warner case. You will appreciate that I cannot say very much now. The deadline for the Commission's decision is 24 October. The hearing on this merger is taking place today and tomorrow in Brussels. We expressed our concerns on 22 August when we issued our statement of objections to the parties. There is nothing else I can add at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gallagher and another honourable Member referred to the allocation system for third-generation mobile telephone licences. The auctions will increase the number of mobile telephone operators in the Union. More players mean more competition, so we can only welcome the outcome of the auctions from a competitive standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">We will obviously make sure that the consortia put in place will not lead to concerted practices because membership will vary from country to country. It has been pointed out that the sums paid to EU governments to obtain licences are too high and that making it necessary for the operators to recoup their initial investment would lead to higher prices for consumers and perhaps limit the development of new advanced mobile telephone services. But this is not a competition law issue as such, whereas trying to introduce restrictions on competition in order to make it easier to recoup the cost would be sanctioned by competition law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, irrespective of the system used – auctions, beauty contests or whatever – the precise rules of a beauty contest or an auction can require scrutiny to ensure, for example, that incumbents are not favoured and that non-discrimination, transparency and proportionality are guaranteed. So even though Member States are free to choose either a beauty contest, an auction system or a mixture of both, they must still comply with competition law and the sector-specific telecommunications legislation on licensing and with the state aid rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I could mention that the competition DG is currently looking into a complaint against the Netherlands, jointly with the information society DG. They are also looking into a complaint against France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and finally, we are also investigating a UMTS auction under the state aid rules. So we are trying to be vigilant as all of you urge us to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Della Vedova is afraid that the Community authorities will attempt to overburden the development of this sector, which is going to become so important for the European economy, with regulatory constraints. I can assure him that, as far as regulations are concerned, the Commission is trying to keep constraints to a minimum and, that it is for precisely this reason that it considers that it is important for competition policy to play a major role.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as pluralism – also mentioned by Mr Della Vedova – is concerned, I can only point out that, under the current European system, Member States can adopt measures to protect pluralism. This is recognised in the merger regulation as one of the legitimate grounds for Member States to intervene, provided, of course, that the purpose of the intervention is to protect pluralism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I note that Mrs Villiers urges us to apply competition law toughly. I hope we will live up to your expectations in the future, without being prejudiced against size as such. We have to examine situations case by case. Size can sometimes create problems. Even smaller operators can create competition problems and then we have to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, several Members – Mrs Read, Mr Markov, Mrs Ainardi, Mr Rapkay – have recognised and stressed the beneficial impact of the development of this sector on employment, but also expressed some concern about the social impact of mergers. I must be very brief at this stage. This raises two issues. As to the general effect on employment, I firmly believe that if competition is maintained employment tends to benefit. This has clearly been the case in the telecommunication industry. Even though incumbents may have laid off some workers, liberalisation has created a large number of new entrants which are creating new employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is extremely keen that workers' rights should be safeguarded. The whole deployment of Commission policy instruments and the assessment of concentrations is limited purely to the aspects covered by competition law. However the Commission welcomes the involvement of workers' representatives in the merger control process. Representatives have a right to be heard at all stages of the procedure. I know from experience that their views are a valuable input for my services.</p>
<p class="contents">I am increasingly convinced that rigorous competition is a key component of a social market economy, be it in the traditional sectors or in the new sectors and – I stress both adjectives – social and market economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
