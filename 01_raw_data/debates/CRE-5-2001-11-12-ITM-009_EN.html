Never mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Second attempt: privacy in the electronic communications sector. I seem to remember that, last time, this House failed in its attempt to adopt a majority position because the two proposals made on the issue of unsolicited commercial e-mails – the proposal for compulsory European opt-in and the proposal allowing Member States the freedom to choose whether to opt in or opt out – as well as a joint proposal presented to the Members, too late in my view, cancelled each other out. The three proposals, therefore, cancelled each other out. Now, however, I feel that Parliament is, at last, ready to take a decision on this point, since the position of the Parliamentary Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights leaving the Member States the freedom to choose and the position of the Commission, compulsory European opt-in, have both been tempered, so to speak, and have become more reconciled in that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights has taken into consideration the concerns relating to voice mail, in particular, and, on the other hand, the position advocating the introduction opting in, making an initial binding choice, at European level has taken into consideration the need to communicate with existing clients of a particular company or business.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Members and the groups, in particular, will be able to decide between these two alternatives without getting confused at the last minute. Parliament will have the opportunity to choose between these two alternatives. In my opinion, and I would like to make this quite clear, there is not enough information or evidence showing that the countries operating the opt-in system are better equipped to fight spamming. Internet spamming is illegal in any case, because it is already illegal to collect addresses without authorisation, it is already illegal to use them without authorisation, it is already illegal to send messages without clearly specifying the sender and it is already illegal to send messages without making it possible for the recipients to delete their details easily from the lists. On the other hand, making opting in compulsory is not without risks either, in terms, for example, of freedom of communication. It is no accident that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights has been cautious on this matter. There are, in fact, groups of non-governmental organisations which have expressed their concern at the possibility, for example, of Internet campaigns being used to raise funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this debate, this legislation, has now already been made obsolete by technology and practical facts. It appears that consumers now already have the facility to choose, themselves, individually, between an opt-in or opt-out system, without having to contact the sender of the message before deleting their details from the lists but simply placing the address of the sender in question on a black list so that they no longer have to receive messages from that sender. However, in view of the fact that six years have passed since the adoption of the General Data Protection Directive and many of the Member States have still not ratified it, that four years have passed since the adoption of the directive to be amended by this proposal for a directive and that many of the Member States have not even applied the ’97 directive, it is reasonable to predict, given these time frames, that this legislation will also take who knows, maybe three, four or five years to enter into force. If, in three, four or five years’ time, consumers and users really feel the need to be protected against unsolicited commercial e-mails, the market and technology will make the systems already available today even more simple. It would be a shame, however, if, after displaying this great, understandable concern about the nuisance caused by unsolicited commercial e-mails, we prepared, on the other hand, to give national police authorities full access to our personal data whenever they want it. This is not purely a problem of this directive: it is a more general political problem. I realise this. I fear that this is the direction in which we are heading and that the citizens’ greatest privacy concerns are not caused by the prospect of receiving a few more or less unsolicited commercial e-mails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, at second reading stage, all we have to do is find a solution to the opt-in/opt-out problem. I will therefore be speaking only about that. Looking at the various proposals currently before Parliament reveals, in my opinion, that they are different kinds of opt-out proposals. Only the Commission's document would mean a real opting-in. This means, then, that only the Commission's proposal would guarantee that citizens would themselves be able to say that they wanted <span class="italic">‘</span>spamming<span class="italic">’</span>, that is to say, to receive electronic advertising, or that they wanted to have the option of consistently refusing it. All other options, that is, the various proposed opt-outs, do not, in my judgment, guarantee this.</p>
<p class="contents">So I cannot be greatly satisfied with what is offered here as a compromise, and I believe that, to live up to the title of this proposal, a text with some bearing on data protection would have to be passed, in which case you have no option but to take the Commission's line, support this proposal, and reject the other proposals that have been submitted to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am in fundamental agreement with much of this report and find many of the points addressed in it sensible. But that was voted on at the last session. Now, it is just about the opting out and opting in. I think that, if we are talking in terms of data protection, we have to support the Commission's proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our positions have moved closer, without, however, becoming identical. So the rapporteur has taken misgivings on the left of this House into account, in that the consumer's consent will in future be required for the sending of SMS advertising. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has accepted by a substantial majority the so-called soft opt-out compromise supported by the rapporteur. This proposal alone defends the interests of consumers without doing away with European jobs on a massive scale. Why?</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament were to generally prohibit business-to-customer advertising from the outset, as Mrs Paciotti's proposal would have it, businesses would simply send their advertising material into the European Union from the USA or other third States. The European consumer would have gained nothing, absolutely nothing, and the only effect would be to weaken the European e-business market. We therefore want to let those states that at present have an opt-out system retain it, keep an eye on developments and come to a new decision after two years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Cappato proposal takes three steps to protect the consumer. First, the consumer can put his name on what is termed a ‘Robinson list’, so that advertising material may not generally be sent to him. Secondly, the consumer can, simply and without charge, indicate his wish not to receive e-mail advertising from specific companies. Thirdly, e-mail advertising will be easily recognisable as such in the inbox and will be able to be deleted simply and without cost.</p>
<p class="contents">This last option is already available from providers such as AOL – I am sure Mr van Velzen is about to point that out – but this does not put AOL in a monopolistic position. Such an assertion is complete nonsense, as anyone can already download from the Internet a spam recognition program of this sort, no matter what Internet Service Provider he has a contract with for everything else. By the way, AOL was itself opposed to such a regulation. So I would ask you to support Mr Cappato's proposed compromise by a significant majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paciotti (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the return of this file to committee has certainly made the positions clearer, but I feel it has not improved the result: it fact it has, to some extent, had quite the opposite effect. Indeed, last time it voted, the European Parliament had the wisdom to accept the Commission’s proposal at least on the point relating to electronic directories, thereby ensuring that each of us is free to choose whether to be included in a public directory. Thus, the decision, which I consider to be a mistake and damaging not just in terms of freedom but of the very development of electronic commerce as well, to allow the sending of unwanted messages while leaving recipients the option to complain and request not to be sent any more, appeared to be less harmful too.</p>
<p class="contents">By refusing the proposal for opting into public directories for everybody, without even making an exception for mobile phones, we are all placing ourselves at the mercy of all kinds of annoying petitioners and solicitors. We do not even have the protection that once existed in the days when there were only fixed telephones and printed directories. In those days, we could protect ourselves effectively by becoming ex-directory or changing our telephone numbers. Nowadays, when every public directory ends up on the Internet, we have no way of protecting ourselves. We can ask for our phone number or e-mail address to be deleted but it is no use! By now, it is in the hands of users and parties who cannot be traced. Therefore, deciding to amend Article 12 of the directive would really appear not to benefit us in terms of freedom and, quite frankly, I fail to understand how we can give freedom of advertising precedence over individual freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as unsolicited messages, as mentioned in Article 13 of the directive, are concerned, giving the Member States the choice takes away the usefulness of the directive itself in view of the need for harmonisation. Quite frankly, I cannot believe that all this will benefit electronic commerce. In fact, I feel that, as well as people such as our rapporteur, who is expert at using electronic tools, there are also still many, many citizens like myself who have little aptitude for such tools and are therefore concerned. To be honest, I can promise you that I will not be sending requests to any businesses and I will not open any messages for fear that what currently happens to me will continue, even though I am protected in my country, namely that my provider, no less, which has of necessity to know my address, constantly sends me unwanted communications and so, alas, does an airline which I once made the mistake of emailing.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, until I am protected – I am speaking on my own behalf but there are also many other people, older people like myself or people who have less expertise than many young people – I will do without electronic commerce, because it is not something in which I have confidence. The idea of being in a directory which is accessible throughout the entire Internet, of receiving messages and then requesting that they be deleted, of having to open them first, of having to try and understand these tools, does not inspire me with confidence. It may be that as electronic commerce develops, it will provide greater protection, but it does need to develop first. We must start by allowing electronic commerce to develop, but in order to do so we need to have confidence in it, and this proposal does not inspire that confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is one great myth that has gripped the Left and that is that spam is the same as unsolicited e-mail. I am afraid to say, Commissioner, that the Commission is at the root of this confusion. In your original proposal you said that spam equals unsolicited e-mails. It is not true. I am afraid the spammers who are already breaking the law are going to carry on breaking the law. Mrs Paciotti, you will continue to get spam!</p>
<p class="contents">I support the opt-out on two grounds. The first is that opt-in will unjustifiably harm both business and charities. Big American firms can afford TV advertising, press, billboard and so on. We are going to damage small- and medium-sized European firms for whom commercial e-mail provides a legitimate way into e-commerce. It is going to put them at a disadvantage. It is going to put charities at a disadvantage and studies show that people do not mind receiving them. They will not opt out even if they could. But of course it is human nature not to opt in to get them. There is also a misunderstanding about the civil liberties implications. Under opt-out, it is very easy to show that you have opted out and reputable senders have no interest in ignoring your request because they will just irritate you.</p>
<p class="contents">Opt-in is superficially pro-consumer, but you would have to prove that you never opted in, which is actually more difficult. Finally, under an opt-in regime, people might opt to receive mailings from organisations that could be embarrassing for them, such as gay organisations when they did not wish to come out, or they could be open to malicious abuse. If they opted in to get mailings from subversive political movements they could find themselves attracting unwarranted surveillance from the police, for instance. The Left has got it wrong and for once Mr von Boetticher is right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of direct marketing by <span class="italic">e</span>-mail, this is clearly a matter with cross-border implications. I do not call for a complete ban on direct marketing by <span class="italic">e</span>-mail, but it is of the utmost importance for consumers to be given the choice beforehand whether they want to deal with this kind of direct marketing and for them to grant their approval or not, as the case may be. After all, that saves them a great deal of time, money and bother.</p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteur Cappato suggests leaving the choice of opting in or out to the Member States. However, that would produce an incoherent European policy. A Member State that has chosen in favour of opting in will experience many difficulties in countering unwanted <span class="italic">e</span>-mails, if Member States that have chosen in favour of opting out do permit them. If European policy is divided and fragmented, the chances of establishing international agreements concerning unwanted <span class="italic">e</span>-mails are as good as non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that businesses can easily side-step European rules from countries outside the European Union. This should not stop us from drafting legislation at European level. It is preferable to look for practical solutions to these problems and to work on international agreements. In that way, you and I will not be faced with <span class="italic">e</span>-mails from businesses which we do not need at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have the ‘Automatiseringsgids’ of a famous Dutch newspaper, in front of me. On behalf of all my fellow MEPs who want to learn from technology neutrality, it might be useful to read out a few quotes from it.</p>
<p class="contents">NTT DoCoMo earmarks USD 8.2 million to control unsolicited <span class="italic">e</span>-mails on mobile phones. The <span class="italic">e</span>-mail addresses of NTT DoCoMo mobile phones are based on the phones’ telephone numbers. That enables all kinds of advertising agencies and dating agencies to advertise their services by sending messages to randomly generated numbers. The article also states that in Japan, the receiver of the text message contributes towards the cost of sending it. This might be food for thought for all those people who claim that the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato is technology-neutral. It clearly is not, for as soon as one is faced with UMTS, the difference between <span class="italic">e</span>-mail and SMS fades into the background, with all the consequences that this entails. That is why it is much preferable to talk about electronic communications, as is done in Amendment No 44. That is, in fact, the final step which rapporteur Cappato should have taken in order to put an excellent proposal before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be very aware that citizens are not all computer-illiterate. Despite this, they are saddled with most problems. If we were to adopt the proposal of Amendment No 35 by Mr Cappato to change <span class="italic">e</span>-mail services of this kind, the entire computer system would need to be changed. Indeed, we would then need to change over from the POP 3 system, which nearly everyone in Europe has, to the <span class="italic">e</span>-map system which is offered by only one American provider. However, if that were the case, the Commissioner would immediately receive a complaint about the lack of competition in Europe. That is another reason why I believe it should not be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore propose approving the Cappato report but also improving on it further by voting in favour of Amendment No 44 instead of Amendment No 35. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Cappato and especially with Baroness Ludford. We are all members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs; we have adopted a position and we have not rushed into it just because we have been bullied and lobbied on the Internet and via the fax machines that are in all our offices. We have to be very careful about legislating on the hoof.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to the Commission that what it is proposing is wrong and hurried. In 2003 we will have a very good opportunity, in the e-commerce directive, to gather the information and the wisdom obtained from those Member States which have chosen either to opt in or to opt out. We must only propose and adopt legislation on the basis of good counsel and good experience.</p>
<p class="contents">We must never underestimate the civil liberties implications to which Baroness Ludford has rightly alerted this House. At this time, when we perhaps are being a little over-assertive with some of the legislation we are bringing forward, I do not want anyone to have to confirm why they have opted to receive, for instance, <span class="italic">Ammunition Weekly</span> or why they have chosen to get some information from Amnesty International. The Internet has freed people from dictatorships and oppressors, and yet here we are introducing a kind of censorship by the back door. It is wrong and ill-informed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner may shake his head and smile, but does he want to have to explain to a government agency or some other agency why he has chosen to opt in? That is not freedom: that is being answerable for using a service that is intended to free you.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the right of privacy: we all have the right of privacy, but that right cannot be imposed on individuals. Individuals choose the right of privacy and then legislation backs it up.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of unsolicited commercial e-mail: not all UCE is spam. Here again the Commission has played right into the hands of those who want to drive jobs out of the EU and who pretend that, just because the EU is imposing a ban on sending UCEs within its territory, such a ban will be respected by people in Japan, the Philippines, the USA or anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on spamming, I myself have been spammed. My name has been put on various lists and the spam comes in. That has been done by individuals who have opted me in to the lists held by the spammers. I have a very good option: I have a filter, I have a delete button. We must encourage people to use the technology and stop being their nannies. Please support the Cappato report, as amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am not a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but I particularly want to commend Mr Cappato and colleagues here tonight for their courageous stand in amending the Commission's original proposal. I was sorry that we did not uphold all of Mr Cappato's report last time. This compromise has all the hallmarks of a compromise. In other words it is not terribly satisfactory but at least it is better than the original proposal from the Commission, and the amendment by the Socialist Group which I hope will not be supported tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to consider this essentially a transitional piece of work. I think everyone here tonight is working on legislation in the electronic age. I have worked on the e-commerce directive, the copyright directive and we are working on the electronic communications bills. What is quite clear is the immense pace and change of technology and the reconstruction of markets that is going on all the time. As a number of colleagues have said tonight, the world of electronic communications is offering immense benefits to the citizens, whether it is in their own personal access to charities or political parties or in the marketplace. What some colleagues want to do, is to shut that down. Clearly we cannot do that because it operates on a global level. That is where the spam is coming from. So we have promised something to our citizens we cannot deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we have to work towards a global solution that will be driven by technology. We want a global format that will allow people to tag their e-mail messages by sender and by subject. We can have the technology to give people complete control. If we adopt this proposal and pass this amendment, we will be walking away from the opportunity to create the right environment so that people can really benefit from the immense power of the new communications world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The Commission has already expressed its position on the amendments that were adopted on 6 September. I am tempted to go back to that debate, but I want to be brief and concentrate on the essential question about unsolicited e-mail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to point out that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 16, 25 and 34 that were rejected by Parliament on 6 September and are now resubmitted to the vote. The Commission can support the new Amendment No 43 on itemised bills.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now focus on what has turned out to be the single most important topic in the debate on the proposed directive, namely unsolicited e-mail.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has been discussing the question of opting in or opting out for several years now and the result of the vote on 6 September showed how difficult it still is to find a compromise solution that is acceptable to a broad majority.</p>
<p class="contents">However we cannot hesitate for much longer, we need to decide. We have not hurried this decision. There has been huge public international debate with industry, with scientists, with lawyers. I have myself participated in intensive debates in the United States and in Europe on this issue. I strongly disagree that asking a person whether they wish to opt in before you can bill them is a restriction on civil liberties. That is completely illogical. We can disagree on the details, but if people are asked to pay, they should have a choice beforehand, not afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We should no longer be thinking mainly about messages arriving at a PC on our desk. We should be thinking about the future. Technology is changing rapidly. The wireless Internet will be different from the Internet available only on desktops.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive point about the proposal made by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms in Amendment No 33 is that it recognises that unsolicited commercial messages to mobile phones are a real problem which can only be addressed by a harmonised opt-in approach. I fully agree.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the flaw in that proposal is that it is based on the assumption that a mobile terminal can only receive SMS messages. Unfortunately that is no longer true. You can already receive e-mail messages on mobile devices which are connected to the Internet. If you want to test that I can give you good examples. And with convergence it is very clear that SMS will certainly merge with other electronic messaging systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The sender cannot know whether a message will be received on a mobile or fixed terminal because of the convergence. That is a technological fact. Banning unsolicited commercial SMS messages while allowing unsolicited electronic messages based on other technologies is therefore not a workable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem I have with Amendment No 35 is the technologically biased approach in paragraph 4. This paragraph apparently tries to address the problem of cost for users but the solution proposed is not a good one. European ISPs tell us that the technology of viewing the subject line before downloading a message is not compatible with the majority of systems used in Europe today. It would require substantial investment; it would be costly for the industry to introduce this feature and this does not seem justified when it is only a halfway solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, apart from not being compatible with the single market, Amendment No 35 does not meet the need for technology-neutral and future-proof legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 44, on the other hand represents a technology-neutral compromise solution and has the merit of being a fully harmonised EU approach to unsolicited commercial e-mail. In paragraph 2 of this amendment a rather substantial exemption from the opt-in principle is made for e-mail addresses obtained within existing customer relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">Here an opt-out approach would continue to be allowed, although this will mean an important concession as compared with the original Commission proposal. The exception can be justified because in the context of an existing customer relationship, companies have a lot to lose and are more likely to use marketing instruments with consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We should look at the future challenges. It is interesting to see what is happening in Japan today, where the wireless Internet has already taken off successfully. Nevertheless, the operator is facing a serious problem. It estimates that 85% of the 950 million messages sent daily to mobile devices are unsolicited commercial messages to mobile numbers chosen at random. This is causing a huge problem for network capacity, especially since most of these messages are addressed incorrectly and cannot be delivered. Moreover, it greatly annoys users who have to work their way through great quantities of unwanted commercial messages. The cost of purging the system of junk mail is estimated to be more than USD 8.2 million.</p>
<p class="contents">So if we want to create a positive environment for the development of electronic commerce and third generation mobile services, now is the time to make sure that the uptake of wireless Internet services is not hampered by huge amounts of junk mail which the consumer is paying for against his will. Valuable capacity within networks and in battery-dependent mobile terminals must be available for communications, messages and services that users really want to receive. Amendment No 44 is most likely to achieve that purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
