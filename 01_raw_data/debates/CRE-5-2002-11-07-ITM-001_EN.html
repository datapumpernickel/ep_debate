<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, it is sometimes easy to forget what has been achieved since 1992. Many of us no doubt remember the sight of lorries being stopped at our internal borders, their loads inspected and paperwork stamped. The chances of winning a public procurement contract in another Member State were then about as high as winning the national lottery. Setting up a European banking or insurance network was virtually impossible because of different regulatory requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of a telephone call was extraordinarily high, and the quality of service was often poor. Cross-border banking fees were astronomical. Consumers simply got a bad deal. Our citizens were continually frustrated in their efforts to obtain residence permits to live in another Member State or to have their professional qualifications, for example as a doctor, recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">More competition and productivity gains have helped to create many new jobs that would not have been created without the internal market. The Commission will soon publish figures on the employment gains and growth effects of ten years of the internal market. These gains have been achieved even though important gaps remain within the legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We face a choice as we look towards the future. The choice is between an ever more dynamic internal market, which will remain an engine for more jobs and affluence in both the old and the new Member States, or an internal market which fires on only one or two of its cylinders, and which will be increasingly exposed to corrosive forces. If we choose the latter, we might just as well give up on our Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">A decade ago, there was much steam behind the internal market programme. Today, there seems to be far less appetite for taking difficult political decisions. Even during the last two years, when times were good, we have accumulated a delivery gap.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community patent, COMPAT, is perhaps the best example. How can the Council seriously say that it wants Europe to become the most competitive economy in the world if it is not willing to adopt this critical measure for innovation and growth? The Competitiveness Council will have another go at resolving COMPAT's problems next week, but my patience is wearing thin.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create an internal market worthy of the name also in services. The services sector constitutes a full 70% of all our economies and unfortunately it is still rife with barriers. Make no mistake, once we tackle these barriers, the vested interests will again make themselves known and call on Members of Parliament and ministers to defend the status quo. We shall need the Parliament’s strongest support to overcome that resistance to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Some erosion has also slipped into our framework for the free movement of goods. Mutual recognition, one of the bases of the internal market, is not working as well as it ought to. National marking often acts as a hidden barrier to trade. In some important industrial sectors, there are not nearly enough European standards. These weaknesses in the foundations of the internal market will be exposed even more strongly after enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an integrated capital market that is capable of channelling today’s savings into tomorrow’s investments. We need to strengthen corporate governance, taking due account of the ideas expressed in the recent Winter Report of high-level company law experts chaired by Professor Jaap Winter. We must offer our companies the flexibility to organise themselves on a continental scale, including through takeover bids. We need to remove tax obstacles, which add unnecessarily to the costs of doing business. We need to open up further the network industries. We need to deal with the pension time bomb. We need better and simpler rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules need to be transposed on time and correctly. We talk about biotech as one of the growth sectors of the future of Europe. But only six Member States out of fifteen have now transposed the directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions. This transposition was due 18 months ago, so nine Member States have stepped out of line and are lagging behind in this area. Overall, the transposition deficit for internal market directives is moving away again from the 1.5% target set by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have our work cut out. I know that none of this is easy. Taking decisions will probably become even more difficult in an enlarged European Union. There is a real risk that the delivery gap will grow wider unless we begin to act strategically by putting the European Union’s long-term interests before narrow sectoral interests, which oppose change.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the strong support of our citizens and businesses. Next week, the Commission will publish the results of a major survey on ten years of the internal market. I can already tell you that the survey shows that 77% of our citizens and 84% of our businesses feel that the internal market has been a very positive force in their lives. They want the internal market to serve them even better in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">At the level of the Parliament, the Commission is eagerly awaiting the forthcoming report on the internal market strategy, for which Mr Harbour is the rapporteur. I expect the report to be ambitious and hard-hitting. The recent creation of the Competitiveness Council also represents a welcome opportunity to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after the removal of our internal borders, one year into the euro, and on the eve of enlargement, now is the time for a major new push to improve the internal market. I count on the Council's and Parliament's support to work towards an ambitious medium-term internal market strategy, which the Commission aims to present by next April. If we act decisively, the best is yet to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that I was a little late.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is currently facing great challenges. We have to manage the forthcoming enlargement by ten new Member States, and at the same time we still have to carry out a number of reforms in order that the EU is able to function as an economically robust global player.</p>
<p class="contents">As President-in-Office of the Council, I have chosen to discuss the state of affairs regarding the completion of the internal market with you today, as I consider it crucial that we have a true internal market encompassing all of the new countries, and, at the same time, an economy which can compete at external level: in the spirit of the ambitious Lisbon vision. The European Parliament of today is a major co-legislator in matters concerning the development of the internal market. As President of the Competitiveness Council, therefore, I feel that this is a natural and particularly necessary topic for discussion with Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is 15 years since the idea of an internal market was put on the agenda. It is nearly ten years since the wheels were set in motion. The internal market is one of the most ambitious goals ever set in the history of the EU. In the sectors in which we have reached our goals, the benefits for European consumers and businesses have been tremendous. The internal market has brought more and better products at lower prices, freedom of movement across borders, and especially an increase in competitiveness. At the same time, however, we note that there are unfortunately still many difficult issues that need to be resolved before the internal market is complete.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency has chosen to accord this area top priority. This is firstly because a fully operational internal market is a key element in the EU's competitiveness, economic growth and employment. Secondly, the development of technologies and markets necessitates the removal of the remaining barriers to cross-border trade. Thirdly, increased economic globalisation requires swifter action on structural reforms. It is of crucial importance to have product and capital markets which function well.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market must be able to deliver what our citizens expect of it: a wide selection of products and services that are of high quality, safe, and reasonably priced; and also freedom of movement across internal borders without unnecessary red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming enlargement is vital. The candidate countries are working hard in order to be ready for accession. I am fully confident that they will do their utmost to cope with the legislation we have adopted over many years, and it is our responsibility to assist them as best we can – even after their accession.</p>
<p class="contents">There is great potential in a newly enlarged internal market – for both citizens and businesses. An internal market with 100 million more consumers in fast-growing economies will mean faster economic growth and more jobs in both the present and the future Member States. A 2001 study by the Commission shows that enlargement will lead to an increase in the candidate countries’ GDP of between 1.3% and 2.1% per annum. For the existing members, the overall increase in GDP will be 0.7%. The growth potential of the forthcoming enlargement will depend on whether we can push through the structural reforms which are still lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the greatest challenges we face is the completion of the internal market in the areas in which it is not functioning as intended.</p>
<p class="contents">The services sector is vital to European growth: two out of three jobs are in this sector, and the private and public service industries account for 70% of EU GDP. The Commission’s report on barriers in the internal market for services shows that there are many barriers of both a legislative and a non-legislative nature. We must find a solution to this. As soon as the Commission has submitted its proposals, the Council and Parliament must consider how the remaining barriers can be removed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market for financial services is also extremely important. In the face of global financial markets, regulation must take place at EU level. The economic benefits of the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan have been analysed by the so-called ‘Gyllenhammer group’, amongst others. The analysis suggests that financial integration will bring about an annual increase in growth of up to half a per cent of GDP. I note with pleasure that 30 proposals have now been adopted, including four of the eight proposals mentioned in the conclusions from the<span class="bold"> </span>European Council meeting in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of movement for persons and businesses is also essential. Increased mobility is crucial to maintaining a good rate of growth while at the same time avoiding bottlenecks in parts of the European Union. Many changes to company law, among other things, have been implemented, but a need for further harmonisation has become apparent in the light of such things as the Enron scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">The package concerning the internal market for electricity and gas is also an important element in the completion of the internal market. The Presidency attaches great importance to ensuring impetus in this matter. It is the intention that political consensus be reached on the whole package concerning the internal market for electricity and gas at the meeting of the Energy Council on 25 November.</p>
<p class="contents">A dynamic consumer policy in an enlarged EU must take account of market developments and the real level of consumer protection needed. In this connection, it is crucial to have common rules on the marketing of goods and services in the EU. The Green Paper forms a good basis for continued work in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is more important than ever that we simplify and improve our rules, to make life easier for citizens and business in the EU. At its meetings in May and September, the Council reached agreement on the amendment of the public procurement directives, and the Presidency is now working towards communicating a common position to Parliament as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work together to ensure the simplification and improvement of EU legislation by means of effective implementation of the Commission’s action plan. Studies carried out by the Commission show that better lawmaking could save businesses approximately EUR 50 000 million per annum, corresponding to 4% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency accords high priority to the matter. In the Council’s conclusions from its meeting on 30 September, priorities included the work on simplification of EU rules, and also impact assessments and methods for following up the implementation of the action plan. Our goal is to adopt the interinstitutional agreement before the end of the year. This depends, of course, on the course of the negotiations currently taking place with the European Parliament and the Commission. It is impossible to meet everyone’s wishes if the agreement is to be concluded by the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Competitiveness Council, together with the European Parliament and the Commission, has a responsibility for ensuring that we give an impetus to the work on boosting growth and competitiveness in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that we have to work together closely if we are to meet these challenges. Achieving competitive businesses and securing continued economic growth are tasks requiring a concerted effort. It is in everyone’s interests that we work together as effectively as possible in order that progress can be made quickly in those areas of legislation in which we, the legislators, have joint competence and a joint responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am delighted to welcome the statements of the Commissioner and the President of the Council both on behalf of my Group and as the Legal Affairs Committee's rapporteur on the internal market strategy. These statements are very important and very timely. From my own point of view as a British Conservative Member who joined this Parliament three years ago and who has been consistently engaged in internal market activities since then, it is the first time we have had a statement of this kind. It does mark something of a milestone for me, and I hope for the Parliament. We must ensure that we do not have such a long gap between these sort of engagements and discussions about future strategy. I also hope, on the tenth anniversary of the 1992 programme, that colleagues will not mind me mentioning that it was a British Commissioner, Lord Cockfield, who was responsible for pushing that programme through with the active encouragement of the British Conservative Government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p class="contents">This tenth anniversary provides us with an important opportunity to launch a new initiative to push on further and faster with the drive towards completing the internal market, shifting it into higher gear. That can only be done by engaging all of the European institutions, business and consumer organisations in a much more powerful coalition.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a sense in which we have taken the internal market too much for granted. As both the Commissioner and the Minister said this morning, that certainly is not the case. I want to say to Commissioner Bolkestein that, as the rapporteur for the committee, my draft report is certainly going to be hard hitting and ambitious. I hope my colleagues will support me, and I think they will because the Legal Affairs Committee has been a strong supporter of internal market policy. We have had lively debates, but the general direction will move towards the sort of programmes that the Commission wishes to encourage. We are certainly prepared to rise to the challenge of creating the internal market for services. That is going to be difficult and will need a lot of political support, which, Commissioner Bolkestein, we will give you.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Council, I would like to commend Mr Bendtsen very much on his leadership on this issue and on launching the Competitiveness Council. You do not need to wait for the Commission to take initiatives to move this forward. Looking at this report about the barriers to services in the internal market – which, colleagues, I urge you to read – it is clear that Member States could now get on with the task of freeing up business establishment, removing the bureaucracy about the launch of small businesses and encouraging service businesses to establish in other countries. Those of you in the Competitiveness Council could take that initiative next time you meet. You do not need to wait for the Commission. This is the sort of positive approach that we want to see the Member States making and clearing up the sort of deficits in transposition that Mr Bolkestein identified earlier. So, please, Council, take the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a few months ago Mr Bolkestein published an article on the Parliament's work on sales promotion directives, which was headlined 'Parliament comes to the rescue of the internal market'. We are not here just to rescue it, we are here to drive it forward and that is what we intend to do over the next 12 months and beyond.</p>

This is a special date for me, as it was in the final analysis the European Union's internal market project that sparked debate in Austria, Sweden and Finland as to whether we too ought to join the European Union, and I am very glad that we took this step and can take part in today's event, which is in part a review.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is the imminent risks and historic projects of the European Union – the forthcoming great enlargement and the Convention's fundamental reform of the EU – that make it necessary to consider whether yesterday's objectives have been achieved. It is also right that we should be proud of what we have achieved and constantly remind ourselves of it. The internal market is already regarded as all too self-explanatory, yet it is all the more painfully apparent that it still has loopholes resulting from the deficient or delayed transposition of directives in the Member States, and my own country, alas, lags behind significantly in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">These loopholes and obstacles came about, though, because we did not have enough success at European level in taking the necessary action to harmonise and coordinate. Commissioner, you adduced some very pertinent examples of loopholes and obstacles that still remain, mainly in the area of the provision of services and the movement of goods. I believe that, where this is concerned, we also have to very strongly highlight the area of the free movement of workers, where obstacles to the internal market still persist, affecting the truly mobile elements in the population.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect needing to be addressed here is the situation of third-country nationals, both in their role as workers and in the provision of cross-border services. I believe that, even if we review the objectives of the internal market and are willing to do everything to ultimately achieve them, we should also recall that our concern must be with guaranteeing a high standard of protection for consumers and the environment. Let us not be concerned only with the range of goods and services available, but also with their quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by asking all those who are working on the final realisation of the internal market to help prevent its legal basis from being put at risk by the debate on the future of the European Union, its competences and the principles by which they are exercised. It is particularly with reference to the subsidiarity principle that the occasional tendency in that direction is noticeable in the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We sometimes forget that the internal market is still a process and represents a lot of unfinished business and you were right to remind us of this, Commissioner. If we look at our committee's agenda, most of the work has as its basis the good functioning of the internal market. Still, sadly, as you reminded us, with issues like the Community patent, those big decisions are still being flunked, sometimes, it has to be said, in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is strange because the internal market has been such a success story for Europe, a vision that we managed to sell effectively to our citizens in the run-up to 1992. Maybe it is drifting a bit and it really is time to re-engage our citizens, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in what we are doing. What is in it for them? How does the market work for them?</p>
<p class="contents">It is again a paradox: with the euro and with e-commerce, the internal market really ought to be taking off. Although you mentioned a survey which showed so much support for the internal market, I really do not think we can take that for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">I and my colleagues on this committee were glad to be a part, some months ago, of an internal market forum that was organised in this parliament. We should do more of that to re-engage with our citizens and businesses about what the market is there for.</p>
<p class="contents">If we achieve that, and if citizens and businesses are engaged, the level of implementation and excitement in Member States will be much greater and much more complete. I would like to echo Maria Berger's concerns about the European Convention. The internal market must find a key place in those discussions, or we risk losing what we have created and made such a success of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must, however, bear in mind that the confidence of our fellow citizens in this process also depends on proper observation of what you might call boundary conditions. For example, the single market could clearly be pursued in a way which ignored environmental side constraints. That is not happening, but it is vital that this situation be sustained. The same applies for certain social conditions and constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to services, there is a nervousness among our citizens about public services and services of general interest. To what extent are these fully exposed to the single market conditions and to what extent are they properly kept aside?</p>
<p class="contents">I was looking today at Commission document <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0208">COM(2002) 208</a> and just reflecting on what we mean by services of general interest. I note the following definition, at 3.1.5: 'services of general interest are defined in the Commission Communication on ‘services of general interest in Europe’ as being services which the public authorities class as being of general interest and subject to specific public service obligations'. I do not think I have ever come across such a fine exercise in tautology in a public document. A service is a service of general interest if the public authorities say that it is in the general interest, and that is how they define it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, what that suggests is a certain conceptual lack of clarity. We have a notion that there is an area here which is subject to different conditions and constraints from that aspect of the market in services which lies fully in the private sector. If we do not get that right, we will definitely lose the confidence of our citizens. I have a large mailbag dealing with the fears people are now expressing about the way in which the general agreement on trade and services might be likely to go and the effect that could have on public services in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as being clear about the need to extend and improve the single market and what the limiting conditions are, let us try to get out of the realm of tautology and into clear thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to confine my speech to the European Patent. This is in line with what Commissioner Bolkestein and the majority of speakers here have said – although the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention it in his speech.</p>
<p class="contents">We should give the Council a firm push and urge it to implement a European patent as quickly as possible. The problem that the Council faces, as we understand it, is the language regime, but this must not get in the way of a competitive economy, as the President-in-Office emphasised in his speech. When we take out a patent in the EU, we usually take it out in the USA as well, which means that we <span class="italic">have to</span> translate it into English, so why not decide once and for all that a patent taken out in the EU only needs to be issued in English? This would be simpler and would save enormous expense, and would be in keeping with the way inventors work. They say: I have an innovative idea, I can sell it worldwide, and therefore I have to translate it into English. All inventors speak English; and I wish, therefore, to be a strong advocate of our now having a European patent with one language, and one language only: English. It would increase competitiveness, and would be in keeping with the costs we have to incur in any case. It would seem to me that the Council should now make an effort and push this through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, a number of aspects, which have just been listed, are as yet unresolved – the lack of agreement on the European patent, takeover bids, tax obstacles, financial services – and these should drive the Council to make good its commitments and effectively implement all the agreements and commitments instigated in the Lisbon process so that we do not have to wait another ten years for the entire European internal market to become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank you for your impatience, hoping that, for the good of the internal market, all who operate in it and especially all who impede its progress will be made increasingly aware of how impatient you are.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must become a continent, and the EU must become a political union. We therefore give an unreserved ‘yes’ to an internal market that is developing fully and is able to give full expression to its dynamism for the good of Europe. We have only a year left to implement the internal market strategy for 1999/2004, a year in which we will need greater seriousness of purpose in place of half-heartedness, more speed in place of hesitancy and greater responsibility for the whole rather than parochialism.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no mistaking the internal market's significance, which became apparent in the aftermath of 11 September. The stronger our internal market, the stronger is Europe's position in the world, and the more independent we are. This, then, makes me very glad that we are now discussing enlargement, as enlargement will extend our internal market and thereby strengthen Europe. The euro has made the internal market into a domestic market for many countries and thus strengthened it overall, so I also want to expressly welcome the internal market safeguard clause in the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Directives need to be transposed with greater speed. We need the decision-making process to be speeded up, rather than have it take twenty-eight months as it did with company pension schemes. We need a debate to get the regulation of competences revised in the light of the internal market strategy and of the Lisbon strategy and made the basis of the work in the Convention. So what I expect of you – even bearing your impatience in mind – is that you avail yourself more of your right of initiative and name names rather than keeping quiet about those who are blocking progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has given it its full backing and has even waived its codecision powers in order to save time. It now appears that our European businesses show little enthusiasm for the European Company. According to some reports, there are few, if any, businesses interested in changing into a European Company, the reasons being that it would be too time-consuming, with no immediate benefits and, above all, no uniform fiscal regime. Are the Council and the Commission aware of this lack of interest and of the risk that setting up a European Company is threatening to become a hollow exercise?

I am the rapporteur for these directives. Both directives address matters which are of considerable direct or indirect importance to the self-employed such as the implementation of free movement, freedom of establishment, citizens’ security, health and freedom in general and, of course, the safeguarding of civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear quite clear that the Commission is not taking sufficient account of the needs of the self-employed. The self-employed are the providers of intellectual services, not entrepreneurs, and they cannot easily be made subject to competition. There must be a definition in the Treaties, minimum rates must be established and the self-employed must be recognised on the basis of the training they have received rather than on the basis of their qualifications, which, moreover, differ from State to State. The associations and societies must be given due importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s plans for legislation in this area are inadequate and the self-employed are being penalised by this bureaucratic approach when they have the right to a social approach. The Commission and the Council are pressing forward in leaps and bounds with little consideration for the political positions of Parliament. I hope that what Commissioner Bolkestein said just now is a true reflection of the situation and that a proper dialogue is taking place involving the millions and millions of self-employed individuals, who are, I reiterate, the providers of intellectual services, not mere administrators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the Members speaking today belong to the Kangaroo Group. It is this group that is today presenting you with an initiative demanding the further development of the internal market as it is today into a true European home market. Over recent months, we have had talks with a large number of people in the business world in order to analyse where we have got to, what progress we have made in making the European internal market a reality, and it is the results of these that we are presenting to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, the European internal market is a success story. A fundamental change occurred in the realities in Europe when the borders between the countries belonging to the European Community were thrown open. Standardised entry requirements then made European firms substantially more competitive, and the creation of new instruments, among which I will mention only the European Patent Office, makes it very much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to gain access to the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, though, at the same time discovered that there are many areas in which no internal market exists, where we have fifteen domestic markets within a European internal market that does not really work. We all know, for a start, that this is true in financial services. It is the case in the life sciences, pharmaceuticals and other areas in which there is no internal market either, and it is true in the defence field, where the first hesitant moves are being made towards the creation of common policy and a common internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the leap from internal market to domestic market demands of us – and I say this also for Mr Harbour's benefit – that we should have a common European currency in all the countries of the European Union, and this development also requires us to work on the basis of a common economic model. This must, in my view, be that of the social market economy. We now call on the Commission to come up with a coherent concept for introducing this new stage in the development of the European home market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I mentioned in my opening speech, we are together making decisions on many proposals affecting the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of the EU. It is also important, therefore, that we debate the essential issues of the internal market on an ongoing basis, especially in order to focus on the areas in which it is not working, often to the detriment of the EU’s competitiveness. I have noted the views expressed today. Many people have given examples of areas in which the internal market is still stalling. I can say that I agree with several of these views, and I should like to make the following comments on them.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I agree with Commissioner Bolkestein and Mr Karas that it is decisively important for the functioning of the internal market – for the benefit of both citizens and businesses – that directives are implemented on schedule. I support the Commission’s work in keeping an eye on this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of directives has top priority in the Council, especially in the Competitiveness Council, which is responsible for legislation on the internal market. We must of course achieve the goal – set by the Heads of State and Government at the Stockholm European Council and then in Barcelona – of implementing 98.5% of the directives by the 2003 spring summit.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Community Patent, in particular – which of course many have mentioned today – I can only share the widespread concern. It is an extremely important matter. The absence of a breakthrough in the negotiations at the Council meeting on 21 May made it necessary to rethink the strategy in relation to the Community Patent. It was concluded that the Danish Presidency should focus on the judicial system, and we have therefore held discussions in this field on the basis of a consultative document from the Commission that we received in September. The issue of the judiciary, together with other essential parts of the proposal for the Community Patent, constitutes a so-called ‘package solution’, according to the principle that nothing is finally agreed until everything has been agreed. In this connection, I have of course noted Parliament’s position as regards the judicial field. We have included Parliament’s proposals in our deliberations on possible solutions. The Community Patent is a high priority for the Danish Presidency, but despite strenuous efforts it has not been possible to create the necessary basis for a joint draft compromise. The countries are still too far apart, and I should like to say to the Members here that I too am very impatient in this matter. At the meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 14 November, therefore, it will be a case of reviewing the status of the negotiations and working out how we can make headway in this extremely important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Political consensus has now also been reached in the Council on both of the public procurement directives. A technical examination of the proposals is currently taking place, so that they can be forwarded to Parliament together. A number of Parliament’s proposals have been incorporated into the text, including on the possibility of incorporating environmental and social considerations into public procurement contracts. It is my hope that Parliament will approve of the proposals, so that we can see the new, improved, public procurement rules in the EU as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the internal market for services, in particular, I can tell you that it is anticipated that the Council will adopt conclusions regarding the report on barriers at the meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 14–15 November 2002. There is political support in the Council for the Commission following up the conclusions, and a work schedule has been drawn up under which the Member States and the Commission are committed to a number of supply contracts in 2003. Amongst other things, the Commission will launch a legislative initiative on a system for removing the barriers. The Member States undertake to actively comply with and implement the judgments of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to express my thanks for the inspiring debate. The Danish Presidency accords the completion of the internal market a very high priority. It is the basis for our being able to realise our Lisbon vision. We are looking forward to continuing our good working relationship with the European Parliament in order that we can succeed in completing the internal market, especially on the basis of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to all the Members that have spoken this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">May I begin by agreeing with Mr Harbour when he said that Lord Cockfield played an important role in constructing the internal market. This is perfectly true. He added that this happened with the support of the British Government, and may I say that it is all the more regrettable that Lord Cockfield did not return to Brussels as a Commissioner for a second period.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour commented on services. Indeed, since our economies are roughly 70% service-based, he is quite right to raise the point. This point has also been mentioned by others. In reply, it cannot be right that companies are subjected to a number of requirements which they have already fulfilled in their home country. To do so would add considerable cost to doing business in the European Union and would not be compatible with calls for less red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital for Member States to press ahead with action to modernise and simplify their legal framework. In many cases, the removal of barriers requires much improved administrative cooperation between Member States or, where necessary, harmonisation. That action will necessitate involvement of Member States, and in the light of the report on services, the Commission intends to propose both a legislative initiative to remove unnecessary legal barriers, and also non-legislative actions to address non-regulatory barriers. The Commission will certainly keep this uppermost in its mind and intends to return to Parliament as the occasion requires.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr Harbour that the transposition deficit, which is now creeping upwards again, is a most serious matter. May I appeal to all Members of Parliament to use such influence as they have with their home governments to stress the absolute need for a transposition deficit that is as close as possible, if not identical to, the 1.5% which was set as an aim by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Berger mentioned the need to look after and improve the mobility of employees. I agree with her and that is one of the reasons why the Commission is at pains to see to it that in the area of pension funds, when employees contribute to a certain pension fund in their own country, they can then go and work in another country and contribute to the same pension fund, retaining their rights to tax deductibility on their contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, there was a case involving a citizen of Finland who contributed to a pension fund which was not Finnish. The tax deductibility of the contributions was not allowed by the Finnish authorities. After recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, this error was redressed and we now have the possibility of retaining such fiscal advantages. That is a good thing in defence of the mobility of employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Berger also drew attention, as did Mrs Wallis, to Article 95, which is one of the bases, if not the basis, of the internal market. There have been noises in and around the European Convention that Article 95 should be amended. The latest comments that have reached me on that point assure me that this is not the intention and that the Convention does not want to change Article 95, which would be a very bad thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr MacCormick drew my attention to services of general interest. It is obviously a general term but what is meant are public services which not only at national, but often also at regional or local level, have until now been shielded from competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is favour of liberalisation. I would like to make the distinction between liberalisation and privatisation. Privatisation is not the concern of the Commission. In fact, Article 295 of the Treaty says that nothing in the Treaty should have any impact on the ownership of whatever it may be. Member States' governments are free, according to the Treaty, to nationalise, de-nationalise, privatise, expropriate or whatever. Privatisation is not the concern of the European Union and is not the concern of the Commission. However, liberalisation is indeed our concern. Liberalisation means opening up to competition and it is my view that if such services of national interest, otherwise known as network services, are open to competition, the ordinary citizen stands to gain from that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rovsing spoke on the Community patent and suggested that such patents should be expressed in one language only. He may be right but I know at least one Member State which would be strongly opposed to such a proposal. I wish Mr Rovsing the best of luck in trying to persuade that Member State that all patents should be expressed in English.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas said <span class="italic">mehr Tempo statt Verzögerung</span> – more speed rather than delay – and I cannot agree more with him. He also said that the stronger our internal market is, the stronger Europe's position in the world will be and, of course, he is right. Economic clout is necessary for political clout. That is one of the reasons we should all support the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">He also agrees with the <span class="italic">Schutzklausel</span>, the guarantee clause in the accession treaties about the internal market in its widest sense, encompassing energy, transport and so on, not just the areas under my portfolio. An important part of the accession treaties, the guarantee clause works for two years as from entry, but under the guarantee clause, measures may be proposed which go beyond this two-year period. We have the possibility, should the need arise, to impress upon accession countries the need for a period longer than two years. They should do whatever needs to be done to bring them into line with the internal market thus defined.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr De Clercq, who also spoke, perhaps I may answer in the language which we have in common. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr De Clercq spoke about the European Company, and let me emphasise that it has taken 25 or 30 years before consensus was reached on this matter. Mr De Clercq knows that this proposal does not enter into force until 2004. This is why it is probably too early to conclude that there is no interest in it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is naturally not the Commission's intention to adopt something in which nobody is interested, but as I said before, it is premature to draw that conclusion. What is lacking – and Mr De Clercq is, of course, absolutely right – is the fiscal dimension to the proposal, an aspect to which we will undoubtedly have to return. We all know, however, how difficult it is to make progress on the fiscal front, since unanimity is required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Zappalà mentioned professional qualifications. The Commission presented its proposal for a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications nearly eight months ago. Work has begun in the Council some three months after the presentation of the proposal, and a first discussion on some points is scheduled for the Competitiveness Council on 14 and 15 November 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I hope for a Council common position in the second half of 2003, under the Italian Presidency. Mr Zappalà may be in a position to exert his personal influence during that presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is slightly surprised at some indications that the rapporteur views some of the aspects of the proposal in a critical way. This surprise stems from the fact that the proposal largely responds to a request from Parliament for the consolidation of legislation in this area. The proposal also seeks to facilitate the cross-border provision of services. I would like to address this point also to Mrs Berger.</p>
<p class="contents">May I end by thanking Mr von Wogau most heartily for the Kangaroo group's report. I can assure him that I will read it with intense interest and I will come back to you on this report if necessary. I hope the report encourages all concerned to improve the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr von Wogau has said that the internal market in areas such as defence and financial services is not perfect and I could not agree with him more, although in the area of defence the issue is a very difficult one. There is a good British saying, 'fools rush in where angels fear to tread'. Let us be careful in handling the area of defence. Others in the Europe have a strong say in that area. Nonetheless, I thank Mr von Wogau for this report and we will be coming to back to that point as the situation requires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
