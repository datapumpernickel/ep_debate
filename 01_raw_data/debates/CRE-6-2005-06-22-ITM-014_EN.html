<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Giuseppe Gargani (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members’ Statute that we are discussing has to lay down the Members’ prerogatives, in the first instance. It must state who the Member of the European Parliament is, what his rights and duties are, and what his immunities are, transforming him from a national delegate to a representative of the European peoples in their entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the Statute is a fundamental pillar of the process of European integration, and it is not approved in order to govern salaries or the reimbursement of expenses, but to govern and enhance the role and function of the Member in the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">A standardised approach to salaries would risk being discriminatory, because it deals with different situations in the same manner. Those who gave prominence to that part of the Statute – which I define as of lesser importance and which only serves a demagogic purpose in stirring the emotions of the mass media – are mistaken and have not grasped the profound meaning that new rules at a European level can have.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Mr Juncker, the decision that Parliament is about to make in a time of crisis is important, because working towards providing Parliament with a more European function is worthwhile and fundamental for the credibility of the Union. It is for that reason that the Council and the Member States, who do not want the European Parliament to be strengthened, oppose the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">We came close to agreement in the last parliamentary term, when Mr Rothley, a great legal expert, and I provided significant input. The European Parliament in June and December played its part by listening to the suggestions of the Council, which the Council, however, after we had adopted them, subsequently withdrew and has not since approved. I should like to mention Mr Lehne, who provided a significant, intelligent and cooperative contribution to the text in question; in December 2003, he summed it up neatly: ’we have been negotiating now for nearly five years, and we cannot continue any longer in a situation where the Council leads Parliament a dance like a bear with a ring through its nose in a circus arena.’ I repeat today the words that Mr Lehne spoke at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament have to have their own autonomous reference standard, which no longer derives from their Member States of origin but from their being representatives of the Community. In an official statement, the Council undertook to start up a process designed to provide us with common rules with regard to parliamentary immunity. It is a strong political commitment, which I welcome and which we would like to see confirmed today in this House by the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The text that we have approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs takes account of the umpteen suggestions of the Council and represents an important balancing point, Mr President, on which we must meet. Once again, we Members have been ready to pay a price in order to have the Statute and I have to say that that is also true for the Italian Members, considered to be ill-disposed to the salary, who have made a contribution, since it gives them a drastic cut in their allowances.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although we have accepted all of the Council’s requests, the Luxembourg Presidency has still expressed some doubts, and opposes a recital – number 12 – that I proposed and that the Committee approved, a recital enabling the Member States to lay down supplementary measures in order to make the status of the Members of the European Parliament equal to members of national parliaments. Recital 12 is a mirror-image of recital 11, which in contrast allows the Member States to pay national rates. If some countries are allowed to nationalise the system, effectively reducing our salary, why cannot others supplement it instead or give us the facilities that they provide to members of national parliaments?</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so difficult to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the Statute provides the legal basis – and this is important – for allowing the Member States to provide those benefits that they also give to members of parliament in their own country? By sending a personal letter and by failing to consult the Council, the Luxembourg Presidency – I have to say – has reacted hastily to this amendment, stating that it does not agree with it. It has sent a letter that, in my opinion and – I believe – in the opinion of the majority of<span class="bold"> </span>Members, is unacceptable from an institutional point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undue interference, which I have reported to you, Mr President, in order to defend our independence and our sovereignty. The Luxembourg Presidency needs to be reminded to respect the role and the prerogatives of Parliament. If the Presidency had not wasted time criticising Parliament or finding specious, trumped-up obstacles, and had lavished more energy on preventing the failure of the Council, it would perhaps have acted wisely. It is now seeking to take home at least one positive result, by promoting the announcement of this Statute, which I believe is an important moment in the life of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is aware of the crisis of Europe, which we have discussed all afternoon, and of the need to change method. Europe has to overcome the period in which the weight of bureaucracy prevailed over the dynamics of the issues. Europe is a political issue, not a stereotype, for which clear guidelines are needed, and not a compromise at any cost. I hope that the United Kingdom intends to begin a new course of action, just as a new course of action also needs to be begun by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Council will not reject the Statute on the grounds of this amendment, the content of which lays down a possibility that the Council itself formally stated could be accepted. That is the legal basis. What if these measures did not exist? In my opinion, Mr President, they could be considered invalid by the Court of Justice. The exchange of letters between the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council carries strong weight at a political level, but not for the Court of Justice: therefore, if they are accepted politically, why not lay it down in the Statute, unless there is a reservation in the minds of some people who I hope do not wish to stoop to similar trickery?</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude with an appeal, Mr President: let us approve the Statute as tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs. Significant cooperation has taken place among all of the Members, and it is a balanced text, which will enter into force in 2009, which leaves adequate transition periods to adapt to the new system. It is a genuine first step towards the single Statute for Members of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The statute we are examining today mainly took shape under the Belgian Presidency in the second half of 2001. Parliament and the Council were very close to an agreement at that time, but the stumbling block proved to be the reimbursement of actual expenses and tax liability. The process then came to a standstill, and it was under the Italian presidency that Mr Rothley presented a new draft report to Parliament, a draft that also seemed to have good prospects of success. In his report, Mr Rothley proposed a solution with the potential to reconcile the positions of the Council and Parliament. In particular, Parliament now favoured the reimbursement of Members’ actual expenses under an arrangement that would enter into force along with the new statute. On 21 January 2004, the Rothley report was presented to your Committee on Legal Affairs for discussion. Unfortunately, on 26 January, the General Affairs Council failed to reach political agreement, chiefly because of the budgetary implications of the draft proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2004, in his address to the European Council, President Josep Borrell – you yourself, Mr President – signalled that the European Parliament was willing to be flexible in this matter in order to secure an early agreement. He also emphasised to the European Council that Parliament could not formally present a new proposal without being assured that it would be accepted by the Council and that there was therefore a need for informal consultations. At the end of 2004, under the Dutch Presidency, these consultations took place in the presence of representatives of the future Luxembourg Presidency, and it was agreed that efforts would be made to reach agreement in the first half of 2005. On 12 January 2005, the President-in-Office of the Council, in his speech presenting the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency to the European Parliament, confirmed the Presidency’s intention of ensuring, in cooperation with the whole of Parliament and its President, that the negotiations on this matter would be brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, after 26 years – yes, 26 years – of being directly elected by universal suffrage, the European Parliament still has no uniform statute for its Members. That is why today and tomorrow, when the vote takes place, could be decisive, given that the Council and the European Parliament seem to be able to proceed at long last to a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me pay special tribute to the efforts of Mr Gargani, rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and to the members of that committee, who have managed, within what was admittedly an extremely tight time frame, to present a report that should certainly satisfy the Council. It is also true that the Presidency could perhaps have devoted even more time to this matter. We thought we could resolve the issue of the financial perspectives at the same time. Had we known then what we know now, we should have left the matter of the financial perspectives to the next Presidency in order to focus more sharply on the Members’ Statute. I am particularly grateful to you, Mr President, and to your office and your Secretariat for your combined efforts and for the continuous formal and informal dialogue with our Presidency. You have displayed a great deal of courage and tenacity in pursuit of this statute, which has not always been an easy matter. May I also thank all the other Members of Parliament who have patiently, and sometimes discreetly, helped us to work on this difficult and sensitive issue, which is always liable to be a target for demagogues. This was brought home to me once again this afternoon right here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, for its part, has kept its promise by trying to establish a consensus on a number of elements that might be the key to agreement on the draft statute. In a letter of 6 June to your President, I enumerated these elements, foremost among which are remuneration, the principle of reimbursing travel and staff expenses on the basis of actual cost and the principle that the European Parliament, and hence the Community budget, should shoulder responsibility for pension contributions. The Council cannot but be gratified to note that, thanks to our close cooperation, all of these elements have been incorporated into the final report submitted to you today. I believe that the draft on which we are preparing to take a decision is conducive to greater transparency, an ever-present demand in all of your deliberations and in all of ours. The draft also respects a fundamental principle that underlies all European policies, namely that of non-discrimination, as well as the principle of equal pay for equal work.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter of 16 June, I expressed my satisfaction to President Borrell at the overwhelming vote of approval delivered by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the report you have presented to us. I also indicated that the amendments adopted by the committee were acceptable to the presidency, with the exception of the clause included in the final report, in recital 12 of the parliamentary resolution, about which Mr Gargani has just spoken. We believe, in fact, that the substance of this recital falls largely within the domain of national laws and regulations. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, to prevent a government from paying a supplement or allowance – call it what you will – to its MEPs to put them on a par with members of the national parliament. That, however, is a national matter; it is not a matter for European legislation. European law has to ensure that there is equality within the European framework. We talk of subsidiarity; let us practise it for once. It is certainly true that this provision has been discussed among the various parties. We have exchanged correspondence, which, I believe, has a certain political value and which is based on a sort of code of confidence between the presidencies of the Council and Parliament. These letters have spelled out clearly that such agreements or national regulations, as the case may be, are not opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this last outstanding issue, namely recital 12, I hope that we shall be able to find a solution that satisfies the Council too. It would be wrong to give the impression, in adopting a Community instrument, an act of the European Union, of creating a European statute while paving the way at the same time for its renationalisation. This is essentially why we do not want this amendment in recital 12.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as procedure is concerned, once the report drafted by the committee chairman, Mr Gargani, has been approved by you along with the resolution and decision, the adopted documents will be submitted to Coreper for approval on 30 June in accordance with Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty. I hope that this procedure, so close to the finishing line, will have a satisfactory outcome. I believe that, in doing this, in adopting this statute, we shall also be ending a situation that is completely incomprehensible to the public at large as well as ourselves. As you said, Mr President, we shall be enhancing the credibility of the European Union, the credibility of your Parliament and its Members’ Statute and also of the Council, which, after all, will have approved the statute. I believe that the Presidency has displayed commitment – not always enough, perhaps; I accept that criticism – but what we want to do today is to make that final push and take our decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the question raised by Mr Gargani about the privileges and immunities of Members of the European Parliament, we attach considerable importance to that point, and we fully understand your Parliament’s concern to resolve the issue. The Council agrees that a clear declaration on that subject should be adopted, and we hope that we shall be able to resolve the question of privileges and immunities in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission gave its opinion on the original proposal for a statute in June 2003. It was favourable and made two general observations. First, we pointed out that the provisions in the draft statute relating to the privileges and immunities of Members and governed by primary law could not be amended in an act based on Article 190 of the EC Treaty. In this new draft these provisions have been removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second comment concerned the financial implications of the statute and these concerns have also been addressed. We have seemed very close to agreement before, only to have everyone’s hopes dashed at the last minute.

If anyone in particular is to be thanked for this unexpected turn of events, it is the Luxembourg presidency, although I can well imagine that it would have preferred – and regarded it as more important – to achieve success elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the President of this House for his efforts in this matter, along with the Chairman of our Committee on Legal Affairs. Our being so close to having the Statute owes much to our former fellow Member and rapporteur Willy Rothley’s dedication, to which I would like to pay tribute, and which the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned. I hope I am doing what he would have wanted in recalling three fundamentals that have always underpinned our calls for a common statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from anything prior to that date, it was the introduction, in 1979, of direct elections to the European Parliament, and the progressive improvement of its rights and prerogatives as the joint legislator for the EU, and its budgetary authority, that made it wholly inappropriate and improper that the rights of its Members should be subject to national law and that we should be dependent on national parliaments. As is well known, one consequence of that is that we, Members of a single Parliament, are now subject to 25 different national systems of regulations, which makes a mockery of the principle that all Members of this House are equal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some justification for the criticism that has been levelled at the internal arrangements, including the improvement in low basic rates of pay. All these things give us at least three good reasons why any Members’ Statute is better than none, but there is no doubt that what we now have before us, having for a long time been bounced back and forth between the Council and this House, adds up to more than that. It adds up to a balanced and respectable proposal, and one that resolves the presenting problems to which I have already referred, although we have to take on board the need for long transitional periods as we move towards a standardised system.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with others, I personally would have liked certain arrangements to be different; I would, for example, have liked to see higher gross pay and to have us making our own pension contributions, but this is evidently neither the time nor the place to introduce many different and mutually contradictory individual variants. If we want to have a Statute, then this is the only one we are going to get, and it is for that reason that my Group is going to vote in favour of it tomorrow. We also perceive a problem in Recital 12, against which we have already voted in the Committee on Legal Affairs. We have asked for a split vote on it, and my Group will be voting against Recital 12, even though we do not want the Statute to be brought down at the last hurdle by something that is a current problem, but not one with any legal significance.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a problem with the amendment to Article 23, as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that the European Parliament, being a European institution, can make payments not only in euros, but also in the currencies of countries outside the eurozone. I think it would be inappropriate for an entity such as the European Parliament to make payments in anything other than the euro, and this would also entail numerous administrative problems for the House. We will therefore be opposing this addition, for which no provision was originally made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate my warmest thanks to all those who have played a part in this, while also pointing out, for the sake of fairness, that we want to make a number of additions to the resolution that we shall be adopting tomorrow. Our particular concern is with expressing our desire for an Assistants’ Statute. It is only fair and right, if we MEPs are to at last have one set of rules for all, that there should also be one to put the legal position of our staff on a new footing. This is not to make the one dependent on the other, but we who are Members of this House should do everything in our power to offer our staff fair arrangements.</p>

This must be the best chance we have ever had and, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to thank the Luxembourg presidency and you for getting us this far.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is a compromise, but it is an important compromise for two reasons: equal pay for equal work – and that means equal; fair treatment for all our colleagues. This, of course, is between ourselves, but it is a small step forward for Europe. Secondly, and probably more important, between our citizens and ourselves it will finally deliver a transparent system of expenses based on actual cost. We will be cleaning up our act and removing a constant cause for public criticism. This is a bigger step for Europe and the European Parliament as it confirms its maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group will take a principled line of voting against all amendments, including recital 12. That is not because we do not think some of the amendments have merit. Of course we want a better language regime in this House; of course we want a statute for assistants; of course we want the pension fund sorted out; of course we would like earlier implementation. However, what we most want is a Members’ Statute and any amendment could risk destroying the delicate balance in this House and with the Council. If this fails, let it be Council’s fault, not this Parliament’s. Any amendment could potentially be a wrecking amendment in this situation. This House must show its full maturity and restraint tomorrow, vote for the essential and deliver a Members’ Statute for the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the debate on the Members’ Statute began, it was extremely noble: people talked about immunity, status, and it was a means by which to underline the existence of a supranational parliament directly elected by the European people.</p>
<p class="contents">Then everything went wrong: it has become a debate on money and various acts of pettiness, which is highly complicated by national exceptions that have partly drained away the European value of this Statute, which has now become almost exclusively based on money. Even if we vote against paragraph 12, I call on the Presidency to consider that it is by no means this paragraph that makes the Statute less European. It is precisely all those who interfered, particularly on the fiscal system, who have got rid of the truly European content.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, tomorrow my group will be equally divided between those abstaining and those voting in favour, because there are a number of elements of this Statute about which we have very serious issues, the issue of pensions, in particular. We believe that we are citizens like everyone else, and that it is therefore entirely justifiable that, when you are entitled to a pension, you have in some way to contribute to, and participate in, funding that reserve. That is the reason for which a number of our members will abstain on that issue and will consequently vote in favour of our amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I should like to underline the fact that we are very strongly in favour of this Statute. Even we perfectly understand that we are in a ‘now or never’ situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The final comment that I should like to make is the fact that in recent years certainly not only the Luxembourg Government, but also the Council as a whole, has complicated the situation and made it much more difficult, partly because it has introduced a new concept of, let us say, enlarged assent, by which people are not limited to saying just yes or no. We hope that in future we too in the European Parliament will be able to take advantage of this enlarged assent procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one reason why not all the members of my group will be voting the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Our demand – backed up by amendments to the Rothley report – had always been that the amount reimbursed in respect of travel costs should correspond to the expenses actually incurred, transparency being the primary consideration. Any reimbursement over and above the actual costs is not acceptable. I might add that the possibility exists already of repaying excessive travel expenses, and that the German Members, for example, have already undertaken to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the pension fund, there are differences of opinion among us concerning the proportion of the MEP’s share in contributions as opposed to the share payable by Parliament, but we do, in any case, endorse the basic principle according to which Members of this House – in the same way as other citizens – must contribute to the social security systems and bear their share of funding the pension scheme, even though we are aware that this is a pension fund rather than a system founded upon solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to contributions to accident insurance. In our debates, we should never lose sight of the fact that one reason why MEPs need to make contributions is that it is the taxpayer who pays our salaries. We are all advocates of equal pay for equal work. It is unacceptable that the incomes of MEPs from different countries should differ by as much as EUR 11 000, and that is why it is right that a uniform salary should be brought in. As for how much this should amount to, we could of course have some really good arguments about that. It also goes without saying that MEPs in receipt of a uniform salary should also be taxed on a uniform basis, namely in accordance with European tax law.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States go further and decide that they want also to levy the difference between the European and national tax rate, then they are perfectly entitled to do so, provided that this does not result in double taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle of subsidiarity must be our guide. It is up to individual Member States to decide the salaries to be paid to their parliamentarians. The national salaries paid to Members of the European Parliament are adjusted in accordance with the actual salaries and costs that prevail in the respective Member States. Members should have their salaries paid by their own countries and pay tax there too. From the point of view purely of principle, we believe that the EU should not fix the salaries of MEPs elected by people in each of the EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not be fair if a Member of the European Parliament from a country in which salaries are low were to receive a salary several times higher than that received by someone with a similar or more senior post in his or her own country. One consequence of a common Statute for Members of the European Parliament might, for example, be that one country’s MEPs received salaries several times higher than those of their own country’s Head of State or Government. It is important for Members of the European Parliament not to be regarded as a privileged elite by voters in their own countries, but for salary conditions to be reasonably in keeping with the national salary situation for equivalent positions.</p>
<p class="contents">The present system of travel expenses, which does not take account of actual costs and which is based on standard payments, is quite unfair in our view. Members should only be refunded the actual costs that arise in connection with travel. The travel expenses system can be reformed without a common Members’ Statute being adopted. For the reasons given, the June List has chosen to vote against the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would point out that, in the statutes, Members of the European Parliament are called just that – Members or ‘<span class="italic">députés</span>’. It seems odd, therefore, that, in certain countries, MEPs refer to themselves as ‘honourable’. Such expressions are antiquated in a democratic EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I find the expression ‘the same job, the same pay’ completely outrageous. I say that as a lawyer, as a legal expert: it is unthinkable that a Member can portray himself as an employee who is given a wage. The Member has an allowance and therefore a sense of dignity, and if we want to give that back to Parliament, we are the first ones obliged to respect its rules, which are also rules of behaviour, in addition to written, and sometimes disobeyed, rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Among those rules, European law has to guarantee equality. I ask Mr Schmit whether there is a principle of equality by which, a five-star hotel room in one of the new Member States costs the equivalent of EUR 40, as was our experience two weeks’ ago in Krakow, Poland, whilst it costs the equivalent of EUR 500 or EUR 700 for a hotel of the same standard in Rome, Paris or any other European capital. Whilst you can dine out on EUR 10 in a restaurant in one of the countries of the East, a restaurant of the same quality in Italy, Germany or France charges EUR 70, EUR 80 or EUR 100. Today, we are playing a part, fully aware that we are being hypocritical at least. From a legal point of view, I believe that it is unacceptable, partly because the interpretation that we are going to give – and I am only talking about Articles 9 and 10, Mr President – is that the Members are entitled to a fair allowance, enough to give them an independent living.</p>
<p class="contents">What constitutes fairness and independence for a Member, however? Independence with regard to what, if then, in Article 10, the Member’s dignity is regarded as 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge in the Court of Justice? I ask that that be not mentioned; the allowance required should still be laid down, but not by linking it to that of a civil servant. The Member’s dignity stems from his direct election by the people. Being elected by an Italian electorate of 15 million voters, as I was, is not the same as becoming a Member in an ordered list, produced by the parties in another country where a person has no expenses ...</p>

I predict that what the overwhelming majority of this House’s Members have accomplished today, and will no doubt finalise tomorrow, will go down in history as the final nail in the European Union’s coffin. Its end result is that a people’s Chamber becomes so detached from reality that many view from a great height the real problems that afflict Europe – be they privileged eating arrangements or something else.</p>
<p class="contents">It was six years ago that I came to this House, a convinced supporter of the EU and lead candidate of the same party that provides with our President, who is currently in the chair and enabling this to happen. I believed that we would be able to escape the trap of globalisation and make the European dream a reality; instead I have had to spend those six years watching the European trap being set – step by step, in a succession of misguided decisions, by one package of privileges after another. It is tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am still persuaded that it is possible to achieve real, serious democracy at European level, albeit not, of course, in such a manner as this. At the same time, to accuse most of this House of blindness, as happens over and over again, is to insult the blind. My grandfather was blind, and yet he was very sensitive, having a feel for, and noticing, many things. The same cannot be said of most of those in this House.</p>

The first message is without doubt one of thanks to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for having in some way helped to put this debate back onto the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">An even more heartfelt message of thanks is offered to this Parliament. You will allow me to do this, because an objective that I consider to be of great political value, as a demonstration of the progress we are making towards a process of European political integration, is being reached through this acknowledgment of the coherent role of being a Member of the European Parliament. This Parliament has also accepted a number of compromise assessments that I would prefer were not ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of non-discrimination is invoked, which is sacrosanct. That is one of the reasons why I will vote with conviction in favour of those ideas: the principle of non-discrimination cannot be sustained, however, even on the assessments of the comparison with members of national parliaments. Presenting the fact that the salary and allowance regime is different from that of national MPs as a privilege, while disregarding the fact that that was the one single condition preventing a Member of the European Parliament from being considered to carry out a hierarchically subordinate role to that of a member of a national parliament, is not, in my opinion, satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true for other items. I will, however, conclude my speech by making just one point, Mr President – if you will allow me – in a second. We are finally reaching an objective that does justice to so many false debates and so many provocations on the issue of transparency. We will realise it. We will realise it when we finally embark on a so-called system of ‘payment of expenses actually incurred’ and see the effects on the parliamentary budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It changes a situation which, while I do not know whether it was privilege-ridden in the way that Mr Martin has just said, was certainly unacceptable in principle. Is it normal, in fact, that one Member of Parliament should earn seven or eight hundred euros while another earns ten to twelve times that amount, if not more? Is it normal in any administration or in any service that the system for reimbursing expenses should be entirely devoid of transparency?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the transparency introduced by this statute is understood by the public, because people do not understand how anyone buying a flight ticket can be reimbursed ten times the actual value of the ticket. That is what people cannot understand. Consequently, if this situation is changed, that in itself, I believe, is an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">For my own part, let me say plainly that I do not want anyone to indulge in demagogy now with this Members’ Statute. It is all to the credit of your Parliament that it has adopted this statute or will adopt it tomorrow. I believe it deserves thanks for that, for the efforts of all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have the pleasure of thanking the Presidency of Parliament for the assistance it has provided, and Mr Schmit for his commitment to the first part of the Statute, which, with another itinerary and with another procedure, must be approved by the Council, and furthermore for his readiness, even in the final hours between this evening and tomorrow, to find a compromise on recital 12, which, Mr President, I continue to believe is important for the legal basis of the Statute itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because the Members’ Statute makes it possible to do away with many grey areas and inadequate rules and regulations that I see continued opposition to this compromise as making no sense whatever. European regulations enable the public to get a better insight than do 25 or 27 sets of national rules and any number of compensation arrangements, some permitted and some not. I am aware that there are unmistakeable defects in even this compromise. One fundamental problem that remains is the rule on pensions in Article 14; what is needed is that Members pay their own share of contributions to the pension funds. Although our amendment – No 1 – on this has now been lost, I am convinced that an opening still exists to find a solution at a lower level than that of the Statute and will continue to press the case for a solution of this kind, which must be supplementary to the Statute. The Members’ Statute also, at last, paves the way for an Assistants’ Statute. The House must now make all possible haste to complete the work on one successfully.</p>
