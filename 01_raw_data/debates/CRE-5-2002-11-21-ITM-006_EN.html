I wish to begin by saying that the European Union adopted a strong and unified position during the talks and we would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its excellent work. The Commission is also pleased to acknowledge the sound political support it received from the NGOs present at the meeting. However, the Commission and my colleague Mrs Wallström particularly want to express our appreciation of the European Parliament's ongoing support for the EU's position in international climate negotiations and your continuing interest in this issue. That interest was reflected by your dedicated parliamentary delegation led by Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo in New Delhi. We hope to continue our effective cooperation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 170 countries, representing over three-quarters of the world's population, met in New Delhi for their eighth regular meeting as parties to the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change. The meeting made good progress on a number of technical issues, such as monitoring and reporting, and paved the way for the use of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The CDM is an important tool for reaching emission targets in developed countries and, at the same time, for reducing emissions in the developing world and contributing to its sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">During the final ministerial part of the meeting, ministers and senior officials discussed the actions taken so far to combat climate change, the links between climate change and sustainable development and the disturbing findings of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which show that most of the acceleration in global warming is man-made. They also debated the need for further action to continue the fight against climate change. The meeting ended with the adoption of the Delhi Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to briefly outline the Commission's political assessment of the New Delhi Conference. The Delhi Ministerial Declaration represents the political outcome of the conference. Although it includes the call for all countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and underlines the need for greater efforts to combat climate change in the coming decades, we would have liked it to be stronger in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly address some shortcomings. First, the Delhi Declaration fails to underline the need for a closer link between science and policy action. The findings of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirm that more emission cuts are needed if the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be attained.</p>
<p class="contents">This must be used as an important input for furthering the work of the climate change convention and the Kyoto Protocol. A science-based approach will give us more confidence in our policy scenarios for the future being on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our mandate as agreed by the Council on 17 October was to seek a forward-looking discussion on more inclusive and longer-term global cooperation based on broader and balanced action and participation consistent with the ultimate objective of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Such discussions should have started at the Conference of the Parties at its first session after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. Regrettably, the EU did not succeed in persuading other parties to recognise the need for starting such a process. However, through a number of bilateral contacts with other parties and groups of parties the EU did seize every opportunity to explain our way of thinking. The issue is now on the table and these discussions have provided a solid foundation on which we can build.</p>
<p class="contents">A third but more general point is that the debate in Delhi tended to focus on sustainable development rather than on climate change. While there is a clear understanding in the EU that climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development, the UN framework convention on climate change is about just that. It is the framework for climate change which is well defined and in place. We should not allow the sustainable development discussion to distract us from the climate change process.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this conference, what prospects can we see for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol? This is obviously a crucial question. As you know this requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55% of the CO2 emissions of the industrialised countries in 1990. The first threshold has been largely met – 97 countries as of 13 November – as ratification continues steadily. In this context, we gladly welcome the confirmation by Canada that they will soon ratify. However, we have only reached a figure of 37.4% for the second threshold. Given that the EU, Japan and almost all the candidate countries have now ratified, this means that ratification by Russia is necessary to bring the Protocol into effect. It seems that Russia is still inclined to ratify, especially after the results of the recently published study on the effects of climate change in that country. However, a final decision has yet to be made and no specific timetable has been set out. It is the Commission's intention to continue to encourage Russia to live up to its responsibility as a key player on climate change and to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Internally, the Commission will proceed within the framework of the European Climate Change Programme to enable the European Union to meet its emissions reductions targets as agreed. Internationally, on the other hand, the Commission will continue its efforts to encourage our partners to ratify the Kyoto Protocol so that it can enter into force. At the same time we will also continue to build on the good bilateral relationships we have established with some developing countries and with the majority of the developed countries in order to reach a better understanding on what needs to be done in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody knows that the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step in the fight against climate change and we have to start to discuss how to proceed beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by stressing once again how deeply grateful the Commission is for the Parliament's support and for its very dedicated presence in Delhi itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We certainly missed her in New Delhi.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few points regarding that conference. The European Union must continue to take the lead in the international fight against climate change. It must therefore promote political debate on objectives for beyond 2012 at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">COP8 had seemed a good opportunity to consolidate decisions on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol taken earlier at Bonn and Marrakech. Unfortunately, the opportunity was missed. No broad debate was launched on the main issues for the second period.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant progress on technical matters was made at the COP8, however. These related in particular to mechanisms for clean development, reporting, and review procedures. On the other hand, progress on a political level was disappointing. As the Commissioner stated, attempts to water down the specific features of the Kyoto Protocol by means of the much broader concept of sustainable development won the day. In this connection it has to be said that the attitude of the United States delegation was not very constructive. It consistently avoided references to deadlines and specific objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of our delegation all agreed that ratification of the Protocol by States which have not yet done so must be speeded up. We had in mind Russia in particular. If Russia ratified the Protocol it would come into force. It is however worrying that Russia maintained a non-committed attitude throughout the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the position of developing countries, concern over inadequate financial support from developed countries was expressed. Transfer of technology to facilitate the adoption of measures to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects was also deemed inadequate. Further, we feel we should consider the possibility of setting up an interparliamentary committee to deal with India in particular. India is home to a thousand million people. It has an emerging economy which is growing continuously and its Parliament has expressed a clear political will to cooperate with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should emphasise that there was constructive cooperation with the Council and the Commission. The latter both recognised the essential role of delegations from Parliament in conferences of this sort. It is precisely for that reason that we believe it is not acceptable for our delegations to be excluded from coordination meetings. We therefore request that delegations from Parliament be admitted to these meetings in future, at least as observers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That does not mean that I shall convey two different messages. Instead, I shall try to make the message as stringent as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Having read the Commission’s and Parliament’s report on the New Delhi conference, there is a question that keeps going round in my head. What is it that causes us, or the EU, to fail in communicating our message and our desire for change to, above all, the developing countries? Why is the United States more successful in doing so? The United States’s message is, at least in our eyes, worse in terms of combating the climate change that is under way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for the EU now jointly to begin to reflect upon how it might try to reduce the credibility gap that in actual fact exists between ourselves and those whom we wish to get on our side. That also applies to the possibility of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. These all no doubt constitute the most important aspects of our continued strategy for trying to progress further. It is, above all, a question of making further progress with the important work that will now commence when this part of the Kyoto Protocol has been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Corbey, who was present at the New Delhi conference, made some notes that I think are worth communicating to the House. They are, above all, about the Kyoto process in actual fact constituting a serious political danger because political support for the whole process is evaporating. There are two essential aspects to trying to increase political support again and to raising the issue for discussion at a more subtle and serious level. One factor, for example, is the one I have just addressed, namely the situation in the developing countries and our relations with those countries. At the New Delhi conference, quite a few of them reported extreme weather conditions. It was not just one country but a number that did so, and they also expressed opinions as to what costs the situation would entail.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we in the EU cannot accept responsibility for all these forms of climate change, we must nonetheless regard ourselves as one of the parties which, together with the rest of the industrialised world, has contributed most to creating the climate change now under way. We must adopt a clearer role in helping the developing countries to protect themselves against climate change. We must, of course, also help them find ways of making progress in terms of development that are not merely a case of taking the route that we ourselves do not consider to have been entirely successful.</p>
<p class="contents">What is perhaps most important is that, in spite of everything, the EU should continue to push for something’s happening after 2012 and that we should not give up, in spite of the surrounding world’s actually wanting something different. That is perhaps the most important message to have come out of the New Delhi conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that once again the Commission and the Council did not allow Parliament’s delegation to participate in the EU coordination meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">We knew, even before the Conference started, that the outcome would be extremely hard to achieve: this Conference was designed to prepare for the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol, whereas the political priority is still, unfortunately, to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol enters into force in order for the first phase to begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is regrettable that no result was achieved, it should nevertheless be highlighted that we managed to improve the definition of the Clean Development Mechanism and of emissions monitoring procedures. What I believe to be more serious is not so much the failure to reach an outcome but rather the political attempt to water down the Kyoto Protocol. There was a definite attempt by some delegations, specifically the delegation representing the United States, to take the debate on climate change backwards in time to 1997, when there were neither targets nor protocols intended to achieve action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a pity that the developing countries have fallen into this trap. It is precisely in the developing countries that the consequences of climate change are having the most damaging effects. We believe the choice remains clear: firstly, the Kyoto Protocol is the only instrument capable of mitigating climate change. Secondly, the second phase of the Protocol must be set even more ambitious targets than the first phase, which represents only a tiny step forwards. Thirdly, action must first be undertaken in the industrialised countries and only later in the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found it fascinating, but also frustrating.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, this 8th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention in New Delhi was intended to be a transitional one – more a matter of keeping the momentum going on the climate change debate than making headline political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with what colleagues have said and also express my frustration with the exclusion of the parliamentary delegation from the daily coordination meetings. As a result, the Commission ended the last day trying to exclude us from the press conference, albeit very politely and diplomatically. When we parliamentarians were briefed that morning, we indicated our frustration with the weakness of the draft declaration. The Commission did not want us to express that view at a press conference when it was taking what it thought was a more diplomatic line. These differences would not arise if we were part of the coordination meeting and on the inside. The Commission was very good to us in that it gave us briefings outside the loop, but we need to be inside the loop if we are to be involved and if we are to be described as 'members as participants in the European Community delegation'. The Council and the Commission were on one side and Parliament on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing. The title was changed from 'The Declaration on Climate Change' to 'Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainability'. That is a precedent we have to be careful of. It is very hard to talk about these issues, be objective and keep the focus on climate change if it is suggested that sustainable development is not included. It is a sort of 'hit-me-with-a-child-in-my-arms' argument, i.e. how can you justify what you are saying if you do not include sustainable development? The Americans and others used the serious issue of sustainable development to divert focus from climate change and from the Kyoto Protocol requirements in general.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a fascinating exercise. I would like to thank the leader of our delegation, Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo, and all colleagues for making it that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in a situation where agreements on the environment are never observed: the most striking example is the Kyoto Agreement. I hope that the Commission will reflect on its future approach to cooperation with Members of Parliament – including outside the European Union – but above all, with regard to the subject matter, I hope that it will work much harder to preserve the conditions necessary for the survival not just of the European Union and its almost 400 million inhabitants – which soon will exceed 400 million – but of the whole planet.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am anything but anti-American, I nevertheless feel that great pressure needs to be exerted on President Bush’s administration so that issues such as the climate, climate change and the environment are given more attention and not just addressed from a financial perspective and with a narrow rather than a far-sighted monetary approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We should work much harder in this respect, and I trust the Commission will do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
