<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal before us and the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is, I am proud to say, a very good example of successful, dialogue-based work on a Commission proposal between all the groups and experts in this House, while remaining open to compromise. It is also a good example of how seriously we take our work and of how we implement our projects, observing schedules, and also of how good we are at preparing decisions, unlike the Council. This example highlights the differences between the European Parliament and the Council in dealing with Commission proposals and decisions. I would therefore like to start by very sincerely thanking all the coordinators, and in particular Mr Kuckelkorn, Mr Hume, Mr Ettl, Mr Pronk, Mrs Lulling and many others for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this directive needed? It is needed because we have all committed ourselves to creating an internal market for financial services, because we need to eliminate the financial obstacles from the Action Plan for Financial Services – of which this directive is a part – as quickly as possible, because the second pillar does not include any Community legislation for activity under the second pillar, for retirement provision. What is this directive about? It is principally concerned with issues around coordinating supervision, with the question of approving cross-border activity, with investment rules and with certain necessary accompanying measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the committee have come up with many suggestions for improvement. We are convinced that with regard to the Commission proposal we have had wide-ranging discussions and taken points on board. But let me make it clear right away that we also thought that a change in title was needed to make this clear. This is the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the activities and supervision of institutions offering occupational retirement provision services. It is a financial services directive. It is not a directive that regulates occupational retirement provision as a product taking into account the mobility of employees and all its consequences. It regulates the activity of the companies offering financial services. This clarification is necessary. In connection with this clarification we need to say that this is an initial and essential step along the path towards a European system for the second pillar and occupational retirement provision.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point of clarification is also necessary: the second pillar complements the first pillar, but is by no means a replacement for it. Nor is it a compromise. In reality, it represents an agreement between the two sides of industry in the context of legal provisions in force between employers and employees. It therefore has to strike a balance between liberalisation of the financial market and social security. Social security and employee information need to be accorded a special significance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to list the key amendments. First, we have given great emphasis to the principle of the level playing field, that is to say equal access for all providers as long as they meet the requirements. Secondly, we have clearly defined the prudent person principle, we have set a limit for the switch from quantitative investment rules to qualitative ones, and we have called for a report from the Commission after three years; furthermore, more flexibility in assessment and in guaranteeing security for consumers is needed. Thirdly, we have called for a switch to the principle of deferred taxation, because in order to avoid distortions in competition we need certain common rules, and we are calling on the Commission to clearly control non-discrimination, as stipulated in the Treaty, and to make that a starting point. We have defined the work of the pension forum, and we have established biometric risks as an option. It is not the product that is defined, but rather the obligation to make it available.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we have more clearly worded the issue of the country of origin principle and that of information relating to employees and employers and their representatives. We believe that we have succeeded in striking a balance between a financial services directive and social security and that we will obtain a large majority tomorrow. I hope that the Council will accept our proposals so that we are not blocked when it comes to implementing this directive in line with the European Parliament's decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also want to thank the Commission for the extremely enjoyable way in which we were able to work together, so much so that our joint effort has culminated in a tangible result. That must give the Commission food for thought, to the effect that something must be done on this score fast. Some people believe that, when we talk about this directive, it concerns an abstract, econometric matter.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the case. It concerns an essential financial directive which has major social implications, and that is what this is all about. Millions of people are involved in one way or another in the way in which we want to give shape to our future pension system in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the Commission was right to use three pillars as a starting point. Here, we are regulating a major component of the second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">The first pillar is currently under discussion in the Council and will also be debated in this Parliament in due course. The third pillar has been regulated in the past. But that is an extremely important matter, and we must very much bear in mind the specific nature of this second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific nature means that the social partners have an important role to play, that it remains a financial directive and that we should not mix the pillars up. The rapporteur has managed to achieve these objectives. I believe that we managed to do the same in the opinion we issued, but the rapporteur has adopted this in his report very skilfully.</p>
<p class="contents">The only point that we wanted to take further than the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – and I actually find it quite amusing as a member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee – was further simplification of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to thank everyone and hope that the Council will produce a Directive soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would primarily like to stress the importance of respect for the principle of equality between men and women – which is laid down in the Treaty – by institutions for occupational retirement provision, upheld, moreover, by the directives on equal treatment in public and professional social security systems. I am pleased to underline the fact that my ad hoc amendment has been adopted and is included in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I also tabled an amendment specifying that the institutions for occupational retirement provision should take into account careers that have been atypical or interrupted owing to family responsibilities of both men and women by also providing solutions to guarantee the continuation of membership. This amendment was not retained in the text but, in my opinion, the institutions for occupational retirement provision clearly cannot escape from providing adequate solutions for these situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had and we will have in the future more epic debates on the question of knowing whether supplementary pensions must include mandatory cover for biometric risks. I am in favour of a pragmatic approach – which was also advocated by Mr Karas – namely that institutions must offer cover for these risks as an option, in the form of, for example, disability pensions and provision for survivors. This will obviously incur a cost, which should not, however, be dependent on gender or an individual health check.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues which must be resolved in order to establish a genuine single market in supplementary pensions and pension funds is that of providing a tax treatment to avoid the dual taxation of contributions and benefits, as well as the tax exile of pensioners who are trying to avoid paying taxes, but also the mass of bureaucracy involved in the exchange of information and the recovery of taxation between countries. The Commission only tackled this problem in a statement, and not in this directive. Caution is the watchword, do you not think, Mr Bolkenstein?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is premature for Parliament to issue an opinion now in favour of a specific model – in this case, the TEE regime – as has been done in the report, albeit only in a recital, given the fact that direct taxes fall within the sovereign affairs of the Member States. Let us wait before issuing an opinion in favour of one particular model in this extremely sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Mr President, I think that the lights are flickering from the shock of these thoughts…</p>

I would also like to thank Mr Karas for all the very hard work he has done on a very difficult report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to bear in mind that what we are creating here is an optional scheme for companies and financial service providers to take advantage of if they want to. If we do not create an attractive framework, this directive will be a dead letter because no one will use it. If we overload this directive with prescriptive detail, with centralising details, it will not reflect the diversity of pension arrangements across the EU and, again, we will not have people taking up the opportunities provided by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">So where would we lose out if companies decided that they were not going to bother to use this directive? We would lose out largely on the prudent investor principle. A European Commission survey recently said that, had we used this principle across the European Union over the last 15 years, our pension funds would probably have performed at least twice as well as they have in fact performed. Private sector estimates put the increase in the return on savings that could result from using the prudent investment principle at up to 3%. Pension assets could be around 21% larger across the European Union if we had been using the prudent investor principle already.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here is the potential for increased return on savings without increased risk. That is a very real and practical benefit to the people who elected us to serve in this House on their behalf. That is a benefit that we should not throw away by piling into this directive overly prescriptive details, for example, on authorisation, on biometric risk, on guarantees. We need to take a pragmatic approach in order to gain those benefits of an increased return for our savers in a first attempt at defusing the pensions time-bomb. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kuckelkorn (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to make a couple of fundamental points about the Commission's proposal for a directive. We have said quite enough about the technical details in recent days, weeks and months – we have exchanged views, we have sometimes argued and sometimes agreed. I would like to particularly address the Commission and the representatives of the Council. I would especially like to say a few words to the Commission about the history of this and about the development of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the resolution, I have had an opportunity to deal with both the Green Paper and the Commission communication on the results of the consultation. Whereas in the Green Paper you were still talking about supplementary retirement provision in the internal market and tried to make the European public believe that something was being done for the majority of Europe's citizens, your present proposal for a directive simply reflects the interests of the European financial sector. As I see it, you have either done a U-turn or you were only concerned about the internal market for financial services all along.</p>
<p class="contents">Your intention now is to give the financial market pride of place. You are shifting this issue onto totally new ground. This would be acceptable in itself, if we were really only dealing with a pure financial market directive. However, your proposal encroaches way into the territory of the product formulation of the occupational retirement provision systems already in existence and, as I see it, you are giving the investment sector a significant competitive advantage over traditional providers. This is because you want to give financial products equal tax treatment but without obliging the financial sector to offer the same security as second pillar institutions, which in return benefit from their own security, that is to say from tax advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not giving away any secrets if I tell you that we have obtained all the position papers and proposals drafted by the finance industry, and in particular the investment sector. It is already easy to get the impression that a large part of the Commission's text bears the hallmarks of lobbyists. I regard the similarities with the finance sector's proposals as a great cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to give a brief indication of the main themes underpinning our actions in relation to the Karas report in recent months. Security of occupational pensions is the top priority for us. In this respect we are responsible for something that we wish to establish, something that, at the end of the day, must work and must benefit our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to make a few more comments on the subject of registration and authorisation. Does the institution have to be authorised before it starts its activity and be checked by the authorities, or is it just registered? Mr Karas has made a new proposal on this, one that we shall be supporting. Furthermore, the collective nature of the second pillar is important. This provides a demarcation from the third pillar. We are not just talking about any savings product here, we are talking about occupational pensions, the nature of which is totally different from speculation in blocks of shares.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also considered it important to achieve improvements in relation to codetermination. However, in this case we agree with the reference to national employment law. With regard to biometric risks, we support the rapporteur's wording. We have executed something of an about-turn here, but I think that it is in everyone's interest for us to be able support this directive or this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these substantive points, we also regarded a number of other considerations as being important. We parliamentarians should not let ourselves be frightened off by technocrats who say that all this would not be possible and that it would not be compatible with the treaties. We are involved in the codecision process and have to act in line with our own views. We are elected so that our views can act as a correcting force. The European public expects us to ensure that law is not just made by officials and lobbyists, but rather that political decisions are chiefly made by Parliament. Nor should we tie our own hands by arguing that it is impossible to negotiate a hundred amendments with the Council. My message to the Council and the Commission is a clear one: stop playing about with this directive!</p>
<p class="contents">To some extent, there have been major differences between us over this report. There have been heated discussions not only between the groups, but also within them. Tomorrow we shall be voting on a text which tries to reflect all strands of opinion. At this point, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for his work. If the voting goes as promised, I shall be recommending that my Group votes for your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to support the Commission as far as possible in its effort to keep it simple and not to include unnecessary complications such as biometric risk. The compromise which Mr Karas has engineered in Parliament is one that we can live with. We would have preferred to have the original Commission proposal in its simplicity, but I recognise the considerable political difficulties which Mr Karas faced and thank him for his efforts in engineering that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key objective of my group was to stiffen the resolve of the Commission, to be more liberal and more 'market opening' in its approach to the abolition of quantitative rules. The Commission's draft directive envisages that Member States will be able to continue to set quantitative limits on the operation of pension funds. I am delighted that Parliament looks as if it is going to insist that there is a five-year time limit. I very much hope that the Commissioner abandons any attempt at realpolitik, involving dirty compromises in the Council, and sticks to what is Parliament's clear desire. We want to ensure that pensioners have high returns without any additional lack of security, applying the prudent person principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the two key objectives for us and if we manage to get them voted in Parliament tomorrow, this legislation will lay the ground rules for a vast growth in private pensions in the Union. It will improve the investment returns to existing pension schemes and thereby improve pensions. It will establish, for the first time, a pan-European investor base for growing and integrated euro-area financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our group, we are interpreting it in the following manner: the main aim of this directive on occupational pension funds is to eliminate all the conditions restricting financial institutions, particularly in the choice of financial shares, with the exception of general prudential rules of a so-called qualitative nature, and the principle of mutual recognition will be fully applied in addition to these rules. We are faced with a situation which is well-known in the establishment of the internal market. As for the degree of harmonisation or integration, or even the degree of liberalisation and openness that is desired, but with regard to what Fritz Scharps calls positive integration not going as far as the objective of liberalisation, from this perspective, I would simply like to bring up three points which we feel are particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">- the problem of cover for risks as such, what are known as biometric risks: we support Amendment No 108, tabled by Mr Herzog;</p>
<p class="contents">- the problem of tax competition – as in Amendment No 117 – another example which shows that we are making further and much quicker progress towards integrating the markets without any previous tax harmonisation: we are unable to support this point of view;</p>
<p class="contents">- the question of covering risks with capital, which relates to Article 18 of the directive: Amendment No 116, which was tabled, is, in our view, a reasonable amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political assessment of this draft directive is, therefore, that once again it has shifted away from its objectives, which are not just the unity of the market but social cohesion and solidarity as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herzog (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the directive drawn up by the Commission contains an obvious bias. It is concerned with using market valuation to encourage supplementary pensions. Although the report by Mr Karas corrects this bias in places, it also makes it worse in others. We are faced with a reference model which is primarily that of the industry of supplementary pensions in place in Great Britain and other countries. Yet, in some countries, these organisations do not or only occasionally enter the financial market; in other countries workers are given cast iron guarantees, but the directive obviously does not aim to do this. In particular, it is not concerned with the coherence of national pension systems based on the principles of solidarity, security and universality.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we tabled amendments on two aspects. The first, on the one hand, relates to guarantees for the people concerned, and the second, on the other hand, to public supervision and prudential actions. We believe that this text is unacceptable unless it is subject to considerable amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must improve the guarantees given to the people. The directive includes risks of discrimination and lapses in solidarity. Membership of a supplementary scheme is not compulsory, which explains the considerable inequalities. There is no provision for inter-sectoral mutualisations. The quality of benefits will suffer if the population falls. Continuity of membership cannot be guaranteed if mobile workers change jobs or sector. The definition of rights does not mandatorily include biometric risks. The guarantees of actual benefits are not organised. And we are aware of the risks taken by those who join fixed contribution schemes, pointed out, moreover, by many well-respected macro economists.</p>
<p class="contents">We are proposing amendments on all these points, as well as on the second issue giving us cause for concern which is the need to improve social and prudential supervision. The Commission is offering insurers the choice of opting for occupational pension schemes. The Karas report strengthens this provision by casting aside government authorisation. This opens the door to competition and gives rise to two risks: the first is that solidarity work may be abused and that prudential systems that have been imposed on insurers will be weakened. Mr Karas incorporated our amendment seeking to establish the principle of interactive management, but that will only have any real bearing if the institutions involved are not treated like standard financial investors throughout the directive. The prudential framework laid down by the Commission is vague and the report imposes the country of origin principle, which we find unacceptable, since the destination Member State must, of course, also retain the possibility of establishing coherence with internal social law. Lastly, prior tax harmonisation is still not included in these texts, which means we are once again opening the way to fiscal dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are today faced with a key test on the way that the European Parliament perceives its responsibilities in the area of social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There must be provision for proper pension protection and payments in the future. The only way to achieve this is by coupling the different systems that are out there with the second and third pillar, as suggested by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The areas of concern I have about the amendments and some of the proposals put forward relate firstly to tax harmonisation, which I oppose totally, and secondly to increased regulatory supervision over the operation of these funds, because we already have a raft of legislation governing investment vehicles and investment instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I could advise Members of this House, and perhaps Member State governments whose observers are here today, to look at the Irish model, where we have committed ourselves between now and 2025 to putting 1% of our GDP towards a future pensions fund. That would mean IEP 700 m per year being put into the protection of pension payments for people from the year 2025 onwards. If more countries were willing to do this, then we would not have the same sense of urgency or danger that now faces many pensioners in Europe today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The gap between those actively employed and pensioners is becoming ever greater. Urgently needed reforms are constantly being postponed. The cost of these systems within the Union also varies very widely. For example, Austria devotes 15% of its GDP to pensions, making it the record holder, as the EU average is 11%. The high costs in countries like Austria are partly attributable to the fact that we have virtually introduced a separate insurance system for each professional group. This leads to all sorts of injustices that are no longer tenable. However, as others have already said, there is a crisis looming in pension provision not only in Austria but all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The public pension system can simply no longer be financed and is also becoming a burden on the younger generation. A pan-European market for occupational retirement provision is bound to help in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in establishing this system, this second pillar, we should not impose an even greater burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. They could not tolerate a further increase in ancillary wage costs. The consequences would be disastrous and would, above all, have a negative impact on Europe's employment situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
