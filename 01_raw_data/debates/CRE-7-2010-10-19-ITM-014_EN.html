<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Basel III criteria and European banks</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 12 September 2010, the Basel Committee announced that new criteria had been drawn up to strengthen the stability of the financial system<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

What impact will Basel III have on the provision of liquidity by European banks to the market? Does the Commission consider that Basel III will accelerate mergers between banks? Does it consider that the new conditions will place smaller banks in an even more disadvantageous position in relation to the big banking groups? Should these criteria be the subject of broader consultation during the G20 summit with a view to establishing fair competition for financial activities on the world market? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, good evening to each and every one of you. I have just this minute arrived from Luxembourg, Mr President, where the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers met and reached unanimous agreement on the draft directive on hedge funds and private equity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am mentioning this now before Parliament because this draft document, which will remain a draft until you have debated it here yourselves, owes much to the European Parliament, to the work of your rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and to the many amendments tabled and included for the Council of Ministers’ final vote, particularly those related to the financial supervision package which, too, owes a great deal to the European Parliament’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we will now work together with Parliament in order to finalise the agreement on the regulation of hedge funds and private equity. This is the first time that this sector will be subject to European regulation, and I would like to thank you already for the part you have played in this draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou asked me about the discussions that are under way in Basel and which are connected with the issue of regulation that I have just mentioned. Banking reform is a very important issue and, once again, I welcome Parliament’s commitment, shown by the excellent work of Mr Karas; we talked about that here two weeks ago. You will be asked to give your opinion on the proposed Capital Requirements Directive 4 that will be presented in spring 2011 to implement the Basel III accord in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is an understatement to say that we have encountered and are still facing an unprecedented financial crisis that is not over yet. According to the International Monetary Fund, bank losses attributed to the crisis amounted to EUR 2 300 billion at the end of 2010, of which half has come from European banks. This crisis, which began in the financial sector, has plunged the European economy into severe recession. European GDP shrank by 5.7%, or EUR 700 billion this year alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to restore confidence and stability in the banking sector, and ensure that credit continues to fuel the real economy, business, employment and growth. The European Union and Member States adopted an unprecedented set of emergency measures that were, at that time, not so long ago, funded by the taxpayer. The Commission thus approved 4 100 billion of State aid amounting to 35% of the European GDP. Combined with fiscal policies designed to bring Europe out of recession, these support measures have fuelled the deficit and public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it was the citizens, the taxpayers, who paid once – will they pay a second time? I do not think so, and I hope not, because that would not be fair. Our policy is foresight, because prevention is always cheaper than cure. We need to prevent the crisis and its disastrous effects from occurring a second time, and it is precisely in order to carry that need for foresight and prevention over into our prudential policies that we will be introducing the Basel III regulations in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the same spirit that we want to provide Europe with a prevention framework for resolving banking crises, which, again, will be based on Parliament’s opinions. I am thinking, in particular, of the work undertaken by Mrs Ferreira.</p>
<p class="contents">The G20, in its decision of 2 April 2009, made the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision responsible for making in-depth improvements to the Basel II regulations where necessary, in order to strengthen banks’ resilience and improve financial stability. EU leaders expressed their support for this goal on 19 and 20 March 2009. The Basel III regulations were drawn up in the Basel Committee by experts from the regulatory and supervisory authorities of the 27 major international banking markets, with the Commission’s very active participation on behalf of all Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis made by our Commission and the Basel Committee shows that the new regulations will strengthen financial stability, limit pro-cyclicality and lead to significant economic and social benefits for a wide range of stakeholders, thanks to the expected reduction in the frequency of banking crises and the risks they entail. In particular, this reform will benefit borrowers, companies and individuals, but also creditors, governments, small and medium-sized enterprises and our citizens in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, these benefits will only become apparent over time because of the gradual introduction of the new regulations and the transitional clauses announced by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision on 12 September 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to liquidity requirements. Liquidity regulations are subject to an observation period until 2015. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou asked me if the new rules will accelerate mergers between banks; that is not the aim of the reform, but if some banks failed to comply with these new regulations on time and therefore had to merge with their competitors or even their partners, that would lead to greater protection for their depositors and creditors, and to increased financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I also understand your concern that the new regulations will disproportionately affect smaller banks. The quantitative study carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors on the impact of Basel III on the banking sector has shown that small banks, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, would, in fact, be less affected by the new regulations than the top 50 banking groups of the European Union. This is mainly due to small banks’ higher level of initial capitalisation and their simpler business model.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission attaches great importance to establishing fair competition at international level. At this stage, I do not consider it advisable for the G20 to open another major debate on all the regulations defined in the context of Basel III because these were the result of lengthy, balanced discussions. On the other hand, the political governance of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board are a tool for Europe, enabling it to ensure that everyone will effectively implement the Basel accord properly and on time. That is what I can say in answer to your very important question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do you believe that liquidity will not be directly affected, because the market is already suffering from the banks’ lack of liquidity and the measures will be applied gradually? Why does the Commission believe that it will not affect liquidity at a time when the market is in such dire need of it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to reiterate that the financial crisis has shown that banks with excess liquidity have refrained from lending on the interbank market because they have very prudently accumulated liquidity for their own potential needs. Furthermore, this problem has been exacerbated due to a lack of understanding of the financial robustness of other institutions. In my opinion, the new liquidity requirements will help to solve the problem of insufficient liquidity in the markets both by improving risk management of the banks’ liquidity and by strengthening their cash reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">The transitional arrangements planned by the Basel Committee foresee that the new liquidity coverage ratio will only become mandatory, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, from 2015, which I believe should allow sufficient time for banks to comply and limit any undesirable impact on markets during the transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig, you mentioned Basel II. May I remind us all that, in the case of the United States, which you mentioned, Basel II has not yet been implemented, nor has Basel 2.5, I might add. During my first visit to the United States, on 9 and 10 May 2010, I also made a deal, or rather reached an agreement, with the American Secretary of the Treasury – with whom I shall be meeting again next week – to ensure that the United States will implement Basel 2.5 in mid-2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rubig, your question is very important because it gives us an opportunity to state that we have international commitments. The Americans have played an important part in drawing up the Basel standards. They are closely involved in the process and therefore it would be incomprehensible ... let me say this in a more positive way. It would be quite normal for these joint decisions to be implemented jointly, in parallel. I am very mindful of this parallelism with the United States; moreover, I am going to make sure of it in a few days, during my second visit.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and smaller banks, generally speaking, we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro-economic impact studies, without improvising, and I will use all flexibility margins in order to develop good measures and good decisions that are as well-gauged as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Zemke asked me about timing. What we are going to do, Mr Zemke, in spring 2011, is draw up legislative texts, a draft directive, called the Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD 4); after we have carried out all the impact studies, an assessment of the Basel measures, the macro- and micro-economic impact study, and assessments of the other measures of which I am mindful and – I talked about this earlier – which involve external or internal supervision, this directive will properly implement a risk prevention system in banks, followed by a transatlantic assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I need a few months to carry out a thorough job: listen to Parliament, listen to the financial services stakeholders, take the right steps and make good proposals. All of this will take place in spring 2011, with CRD 4 and these legislative texts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: EU-Africa summit/food security</span></p>
<p class="contents">In connection with World Food Day on 16 October 2009, the FAO has recently indicated that the situation remains unsatisfactory despite a slight improvement regarding the number of those suffering from chronic hunger in the world (925 million this year, compared with 1.023 billion in 2009). The lack of food security is threatening to undermine MDG objective 1, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In the run-up to the next EU-Africa summit (Tripoli, 29 and 30 November), many of those concerned are anxious that the strategic partnership should place greater emphasis on food security, including issues relating to access to food, infrastructures, land ownership and adjustment to climate change. Does the Commission consider it necessary to introduce a new specific partnership for food security under the joint Africa-EU strategy? Does it intend to step up coordination on horizontal issues in the context of existing partnerships, this being necessary to achieve food security in Africa? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ensuring that every citizen has access to nutritious food is a main aim of development cooperation. Reducing the proportion of hungry people by half is therefore, rightly, the first of eight Millennium Development Goals that the global community promised to reach by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Food security will also remain a top priority for the European Union in its relations with Africa, where many countries are off track in reaching this MDG 1, where more than 70% of the population live in rural areas, and where some 90% of agricultural production is carried out by smallholders on family farms.</p>
<p class="contents">Food security was already a priority of the first EU-Africa action plan, within the partnership on the MDGs, and we will propose to maintain this as a priority area for the next action plan that is currently being drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also ensure that cross-sectoral aspects with direct links to food security, such as research, trade and regional integration, are given appropriate relevance in this next action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s focus on food security goes hand in hand with the importance that African leaders themselves have attached to agriculture and food security.</p>
<p class="contents">The comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development programme is the common framework for action in this area and we will continue to support this.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I believe that we have enough mechanisms at this stage to care about nutritious food supply and that it is not necessary to introduce a new specific partnership for food security in the joint Africa-EU strategy.</p>

It is very clear that we need to take many measures now to achieve the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Papanikolaou’s question, basically we have two facilities. Reflex mostly addressed countries in the crisis. We have also disbursed a food facility of EUR 1 billion to support smallholder farmers and this definitely produced many results in responding to the food crisis. In many countries, the food supply situation has improved. The problem is that this food security is a one-off measure, so we are helping at the time of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads us to the question I was asked by Mr Tarabella. Food security is definitely one of the areas I will propose in the Green Paper as a particular focus area for the European Union, particularly since we have had a very positive experience with the food facility. We know what should be done and we should really try to achieve productive growth based also on the agricultural structures still prevailing in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The correct application of these regulations must be ensured by the national enforcement bodies designated in the Member States. These bodies in particular have to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are fully respected. The Commission’s task is to ensure that EU law is correctly implemented and enforced by the Member States by constantly monitoring their activity.</p>
<p class="contents">National enforcement bodies have no legal obligation to report under the sole terms of the regulations. They answer the Commission’s request in line with the general principle of loyal cooperation between the Member States and the EU institutions enshrined in the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the volcanic ash crisis, the Commission has reacted quickly and has done its utmost to ensure that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Extraordinary Council held on 4 May 2010, the rules on air passenger rights are applied and enforced in a uniform and harmonised way everywhere in the EU. In order to reach this aim, the Commission has prepared and agreed informal interpretative guidelines with national authorities and has kept close contacts with them and all stakeholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every year, some 35 000 people are killed and 1.7 million injured in road accidents in the European Union. Among the statistics, one figure is of particular concern: in 2008, 1 100 children were victims of road accidents in the European Union. With reference to the Commission’s Road Safety programme 2011-2020, and bearing in mind that millions of children travel to and from school every day by bus, will the Commission answer the following:</p>
<p class="contents">What specific initiatives and measures will it take, in conjunction with the Member States, to ensure more effective prevention of road accidents involving children? Will it introduce stricter safety standards and quality controls for buses used for school transport and for professional drivers of such buses (use of advanced technology equipment, more frequent checks on drivers’ professional skills and experience, and on their personal integrity via psychological testing, for example)?</p>

<p class="contents">In 2009, around 35 000 people died on the roads of the EU which corresponds to the size of a small town.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission does not agree with the opinion of the honourable Member that the third European Road Safety Action programme 2001-2009 has failed. Also, the initial target was not met. It led to the strong mobilisation of all parties involved. During this period, 78 000 lives were saved in the European Union and in all, 2 million victims were saved.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the figures, the benefit in terms of pain and of personal and family tragedies avoided is incalculable. In the recently adopted ‘policy orientations for road safety 2011-2020’, the Commission proposed to continue with the target of halving the number of road deaths within the European Union, starting from the results obtained in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this target, greater efficiency will be required from EU and national road safety policies. This involves a strong political commitment by all Member States, in particular, those with poor safety records which should be reflected in the development of comprehensive national road safety strategies drawing on practices which have been shown to be successful elsewhere. It will also require special efforts to reduce road accidents in areas where progress has been slower, such as motorcyclists’ safety or the safety of rural roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Technological developments, in particular, so-called intelligent transport systems, will also play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific issue of the prevention of road accidents involving children, in particular in school buses, it should be noted that very significant progress has been achieved during the past decade with a decrease of 70% in the number of fatalities involving children younger than 15 years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware, however, of the need to ensure a high level of protection of children who are a particularly vulnerable category of users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, I believe that we really should adopt stricter technical safety standards for these vehicles, stricter and more frequent inspections to ensure that these standards are being applied and, of course, stricter checks on the professional skills of the drivers of these buses.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that the Commission should consider an initiative in this direction. I am sure that it would be very well received by European public opinion because, as I said earlier, we are talking about a very vulnerable group which touches the hearts and minds of all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have strict regulations regulating the technical standards concerning buses, and especially school buses. I have not heard of any particular concerns about problems with school buses as such. We will, of course, follow the situation, and we propose – coming to the last question – to follow strictly the rules that all children must be properly accommodated and that seat belts should be used. I have not, however, received any signals concerning this problem of road safety that school buses is an issue that is badly handled.</p>

For those of you interested in our plans, just before the summer break, we adopted policy guidelines which are the next action plan for road safety and we have the same aim – to reduce casualties by half.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Excess transport in the Baltic Sea</span></p>
<p class="contents">The World Wide Fund for Nature international NGO announced in August that an increase in commercial activity over the next 20 years will seriously damage the Baltic Sea. Shipping, industrial activity on the high seas and tourism will more than double. In the tourism sector, the number of passengers on board ships is expected to rise from 5 to 20 million. In 2030, the number of ships will have increased from 4 000 to 9 000, and there will be a proportionate increase in the probability of environmental incidents. An annual increase of over 150 ships is currently being recorded. Unlike other seas, beaches are quickly polluted by oil spills in the Baltic as the seawater is only renewed every 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission assess the threat posed by excess shipping in the Baltic and what measures does it propose that Member States bordering the sea adopt to resolve this issue?

<p class="contents">Maritime transport in the Baltic Sea has increased significantly over recent years, as a result of rapid economic growth. At the same time, the European Union has one of the most advanced regulatory frameworks on maritime safety in the world today. The third maritime safety package adopted by Parliament and the Council in 2009 is a significant improvement of the EU’s vessel traffic monitoring and information system. It covers all the seas surrounding Europe and introduces strict inspections on ships visiting EU ports, also known as port state control. It contains specific measures for the Baltic Sea, such as requirements for safe winter navigation and reinforced ice standards for ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission works closely with all the EU Baltic States to ensure the smooth implementation of these new measures. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) also provides technical support. If an accident were to happen, EMSA has standby pollution response vessels and equipment permanently located in the Baltic. This is in addition to the pollution response measures already put in place by the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also maintains a continuous dialogue with the Russian Federation to ensure that safety rules are applied coherently in the Baltic Sea. In this framework, the Commission is about to launch a pilot project with the Russian administration on monitoring maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea. A recently adopted EU strategy in the Baltic Sea region also addresses safety and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, of course, like to respond to this interesting proposal to reduce maritime transport in the Baltic Sea, but any restriction on maritime transport before its introduction has to be carefully considered and be in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas and with other internationally agreed conventions. The International Maritime Organisation already recognises the Baltic as a particularly sensitive sea area and this status brings with it particular maritime traffic requirements to reduce the risk of accidents and to protect the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that maritime transport is a relatively environmentally friendly mode of transport. Additional restrictions to commercial transport in the Baltic Sea could potentially promote other less environmentally friendly modes of transport with increased emissions as a consequence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: New framework for the EU common agricultural policy 2014-2020</span></p>
<p class="contents">Without a significant increase in targeted subsidies for Bulgaria, the agriculture sector there could collapse. This is especially serious in times of crisis. Bulgaria and Romania, which, in 2007, were the last countries to join the EU, receive just 40% of the amount granted in agricultural subsidies to established Member States such as Germany, France and others. The 100% alignment of subsidies under the treaty on the accession of those countries to the EU is only due to take place in 2016.

Increasingly intensive farming, growing use of pesticides and fertilisers, the increasing size of agricultural holdings, the development of monoculture: agricultural biodiversity is particularly affected and is in an alarming state.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to act, and act fast. As the report points out, a cross-sector approach is needed: the protection and restoration of our natural capital is not solely a matter for environmental policies. These considerations must be integrated into all of the EU’s policies: the way we see the agriculture of tomorrow is decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity calls for a firm commitment to an ecologically sustainable future.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dacian Cioloş, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FR)</span> I am now going to answer five questions, which are grouped together and cover the same theme.</p>
<p class="contents">The total amount of direct payments in European Union Member States reflects their agricultural production and the average level of aid over an historical period. Due to the fact that their historical references have been used to determine direct payments, this direct aid is not distributed equally among Member States, among regions or among the various categories of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-12, that is to say, the 12 most recent EU Members, is in the process of phasing in funding, in other words, progressively implementing direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU-10, direct payments will reach 100% of European Union level in 2013. As for the last two Member States to have joined, Bulgaria and Romania, who are treated equally, they will begin to progressively implement direct payments in 2016, having started at 25% of these payment levels in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, all Member States of the EU-12, that is to say, all the new Member States, also have the opportunity to top up EU direct payments with national subsidies within the limits clearly set out by the regulation and the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As prompted by the Council during the common agricultural policy (CAP) health check in 2008 and during the CAP reform in 2003, the Commission is involved in looking at ways of developing the direct payment system, especially regarding the issue of different levels of payment among Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For the post-2013 period, the Commission will study and assess the various options for reforming the direct payment system. The changes that must be made to the direct payment system and, more specifically, to the way in which the payments are distributed, in order to ensure fairer treatment among Member States and among the various categories of farmers, is at the centre of the debate on the future of the CAP. Nevertheless, there are still questions surrounding which methods and criteria to use in order to begin working towards providing more equitable support. One important matter concerning the future distribution of direct support among Member States will be to determine how to progress from the current situation to a more equitable distribution in the future and, at the same time, avoid major upheavals which could have significant economic consequences in certain regions or for certain production systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP post-2013 will also have to deal with many environmental challenges, including the issue of soil degradation in Europe, which, today, is a very serious problem heightened by the issue of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Biodiversity is also a main priority for the sustainable management of natural resources within the Europe 2020 strategy. Although the goal to stop biodiversity loss by 2010 was not achieved, progress has clearly been made and the CAP has made a significant contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the CAP supports sustainable soil management through direct payments subject to compliance with environmental requirements, especially good agri-environmental practices regarding soil erosion, soil organic matter and soil structure, as well as through specific rural development measures, especially payments for agri-environmental measures which go beyond the basic conditions set out under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to ensure better soil management in Europe and to help maintain soil organic matter, the Commission tabled a proposal for a soil framework directive in 2006. One of the goals is to identify the causes of erosion and prevent it. This proposal also takes account of the tools that the CAP has to offer to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards biodiversity, today, the CAP refers to compliance with environmental requirements, including the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, the infringement of which results in penalties. These penalties reduce direct aid and cut specific rural development measures, especially payments for the Natura 2000 regions as well as agri-environmental payments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the CAP post-2013, the Commission is fully aware of the scope of environmental challenges to be met and is currently in the process of studying the different ways of better integrating environmental issues through all the CAP instruments, under the first and second pillars. The impact assessment in order to prepare the legislative proposals for the CAP post-2013 is under way, and a communication broadly outlining the future of the common agricultural policy is scheduled for November 2010. I shall table this communication to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 17 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I have said on several occasions that I think a flat-rate system – that is to say, a uniform amount per hectare for all these categories – is not an appropriate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, based on the current historical reference system, we calculated subsidies on the basis of a production level from 10, 15 or 20 years ago. This is a system we wish to abandon and replace with objective criteria. However, attention must also be paid to ensuring that the balance is restored on a transitional basis and on a lean basis so that those hindered by these systems can incorporate this change economically. Therefore, my intention is indeed to propose objective criteria, which should be combined in some way with the starting position to ensure a manageable transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr La Via, the issues you are addressing can indeed be taken into account in the context of the second pillar of the rural development programme for agri-environmental measures. The intention is to maintain these kinds of agri-environmental measures, which take account of the specific nature of certain regions, and the area you are talking about is affected by erosion and it is possible certain shrubs will start fires there.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States will have the opportunity, through the regulation we shall also propose for post-2013, to take account of these specific issues in the context of environmental measures and to provide a specific support system in this area. That is why we believe that flexibility is useful in achieving a certain goal, that is to say, the sound management of natural resources, so that Member States can use specific instruments in the context of this second pillar. I believe that this issue is one that can be incorporated into this flexibility, which we can offer Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Romania and Bulgaria, during the accession negotiations for these Member States, a phasing-in system – in other words, a system for progressively increasing direct aid – was provided for by the treaty. In 2008, during the CAP health check, we said that during the post-2013 reform, we would take account of the issue of balancing the level of payments, perhaps more quickly. I therefore think that we should take account of this issue; the appropriate budgetary solution must be found to be able to speed up this process if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would, however, also like to highlight the fact that the Court of Auditors’ report covers a two-year period, beginning shortly after the introduction of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the first year of application of cross-compliance in 2005, the Commission has implemented a whole series of initiatives that aim, on the one hand, to help the Member States and, on the other, to ensure that they comply with their legal obligations. The Commission provides support through numerous exchanges on these subjects and discussions in the various forums dealing with these specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The talks on regulations have taken place in the relevant management committee, the most technical discussions have been held by a group of experts dealing specifically with cross-compliance, and discussions on the supervisory methods have taken place in certain specialist workshops.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2004, the Commission has, furthermore, regularly published guidance documents for the Member States that have helped them to adapt their national systems. The Commission monitors the Member States’ legal obligations based on information from audits carried out in the Member States themselves that the latter send them. If weaknesses are noted during the audits, financial corrections are made to the expenditure of the Member States in question, should a risk to the agricultural fund be identified. This was the case in the past and a certain number of procedures are consequently under way, including at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that all of these initiatives have led to a significant improvement in the running of the cross-compliance system, particularly since the observations made by the Court of Auditors in their 2007 report. Efforts will, of course, continue to be made in this area as the Commission places an emphasis on the smooth running of this system, which is an essential element of the common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I also think that we have to be able to provide farmers with the means to communicate the efforts they are making, including when selling their products. In the quality system used for agri-foodstuffs which we are overhauling, we will also give farmers the possibility of using their products better to convey all the work they do and all the elements that must be taken into account, including issues related to biodiversity. This applies, in particular, to the consideration of the various agricultural production systems since this diversity in agricultural production systems means that we can also start to consider issues related to the environment and biodiversity. In the case of the common agricultural policy, supporting the diversity of production systems and direct contact between farmers, producers and consumers is another way for farmers, through the products that they sell, to better communicate all the conditions with which they have to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">Other methods are already being used. The links between agricultural production and rural tourism are another way for farmers to communicate all that they do to maintain the land and the landscape through the productive work that they carry out. I believe that all these tools, which are present within the framework of the common agricultural policy and which may be strengthened in the future, can be better used by farmers to convey the efforts they are making.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the other question. In my opinion, the rules and regulations regarding the environment or the activities that the farmer carries out to take into account the good management of natural resources are not distinct from the economic and social questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposals that we will be making, which we will talk about after 17 November, the idea is not to move the focus of attention from the economic and social question to the environmental question alone, but to integrate the environmental question further in the farmer’s way of thinking so that, in the future, we can hopefully really talk about competitive agriculture. Farmers must be competitive from an economic and environmental point of view, in other words, in the way that they manage their natural resources, the soil and the water that they work with, while also considering social aspects related to creating or maintaining employment in a rural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we are not, as a result of focusing on the environmental aspect or rather the good management of natural resources within the framework of the common agricultural policy, going to compromise the farmer’s ability to be economically competitive by taking social aspects into account.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have the documents on the table, I will be able to prove this to you through concrete examples in proposals that we will be drafting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Greek Ministry of Rural Development and Food has announced the launching in September 2010 of the rural guarantee fund for small and very small businesses (TEMPME), similar to that existing for small and very small industrial and business enterprises, providing interest rate subsidies and bank guarantees to a total of €100 million for agriculture and €50 million for fisheries. Given that this would enable farmers and fishermen to cut investment costs and capital participation during a period of economic austerity: Has the Greek Government informed the Commission about the above initiative? (a) If so, is it providing funding for this purpose? How much funding is being provided and what conditions must be met by beneficiaries?

<p class="contents">The Greek authorities have not submitted a request to the Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture to modify the programme to include this guarantee fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to underline that, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States which propose the content of measures under the rural development programme, in accordance with the Rural Development Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the rural development programmes may be revised at the request of the Member States, after approval from the national monitoring committee and following the Commission’s examination and approval.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the Greek fishing sector, the national authorities have informed the Commission of their intention to set up a new instrument in order to help small businesses in the fishing sector. According to the Greek authorities, this instrument will be managed within the framework of an already established financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek authorities have also informed the Commission of their intention to cofinance this instrument through the 2007-2013 operational programme for the fishing sector in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that there is a plan for the implementation of financial instruments in the fishing operational programme, the Commission supports the creation of such financial instruments in order to set up key measures for the operational programme, providing these comply with the legal provisions on the subject, in particular, Articles 34 and 37 of Regulation (EC) No 498/2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount that will be contributed to this instrument under the European Fisheries Fund could total EUR 35 million. The monitoring committee of the abovementioned operational programme will establish the criteria for selecting the beneficiary of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek authorities are finalising the action plan that will also include the conditions for the operation of the financial instrument. The Commission expects that this financial instrument, which will benefit from cofinancing from the European Fisheries Fund, will be operational before the end of 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and I have to admit that the aquaculture sector deserves greater recognition of its assets and values. The Commission therefore adopted a communication entitled ‘Building a sustainable future for aquaculture’ which identifies three strategic objectives for public authorities to pursue: promoting the competitiveness of the aquaculture sector; maintaining its sustainability; and improving its governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this communication, the Commission identifies a number of measures to be taken by public authorities at all levels – EU, national and regional – in order to address the challenges faced by the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to support the sustainable development of European aquaculture, including shellfish production, the EU has in place comprehensive animal health and food safety legislation. We are very active at international level in establishing animal health and food safety standards for aquaculture products, including shellfish, that are essential for international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also established an EU reference laboratory for mollusc diseases, which receives annual financial support, to ensure coordination of national laboratories in the Member States and provide scientific support to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, with the concerned Member States, is also closely monitoring the abnormal mortalities observed in oysters over the past few years and has taken measures to control the virus that seems to be associated with these mortalities.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the overall strategy for EU aquaculture is concerned, the Commission would also like to recall the debate held in Parliament in June 2010, based on the report prepared by Guido Milana. The Commission appreciates Parliament’s support for sustainable aquaculture and for giving it a greater focus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the view that sustainable aquaculture activities should be adequately supported through the common fisheries policy, and that this aspect should be covered under the reformed common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced of the need to help the sector organise itself more efficiently. In particular, we want to strengthen its producer and inter-branch organisations so as to better link production forecasts to market needs and ensure higher value for their products through marketing and labelling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not satisfied with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Certified interim payments sent by Member States to the Commission amount to 5% of the overall EFF allocation. However, the data we have received recently from the Member States under annual reporting show that by the end of 2009, 18.2% of the overall EFF allocation was committed to specific projects. This is encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Importantly, these figures include premiums not only under Axis 1 but also other Axes. Only Axis 4 ‘Sustainable Development for Fishing Areas’ is unfortunately lagging behind due to the long implementation process required to set up partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for this situation include, firstly, the late adoption of the EFF regulation; secondly, the delayed adoption of the operational programmes, some of which were adopted in the second half of 2008; thirdly, problems in setting up the management and control systems, the approval of which is the precondition for sending the payments to the Commission; and fourthly, the effects of the financial and economic crisis on the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At this level of implementation, it is too early to state whether the EFF achieved its objectives. More information will be available with the interim evaluation due at the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also difficult to point to best practices in this respect as Member States have very different EFF amounts to spend and these amounts have been allocated to Axes in a diverse way which impacts on the rate of absorption. For example, Axis 1, ‘Measures for the adaptation of the Community Fishing Fleet’, is very easy to absorb. The others are not so easy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of Directors-General organised by the Belgian Presidency last September as a remedy to the absorption problems, notably, to the problem of access to capital, the Commission recommended financial engineering techniques such as the use of facilitators or the simplification of procedures and application forms.</p>
<p class="contents">The next EFF Committee will have presentations on the use of these possibilities. The implementation of the Greek operational programme for 2007-2013 is delayed. I am sorry to say this, but it really is delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to 15 September 2010, actual payments only reached EUR 5 000 600, which amounts to 2% of the total EFF allocation. Two percent is a very small amount. This unsatisfactory situation results mainly from problems in setting up the management and control system and delays in the launching of key measures under the operational programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial crisis is also responsible for some delays, in particular, for measures under Axis 2.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently preparing its annual report on the implementation of the EFF in 2009 which will provide further information and background on the question posed by the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a general rule. Generally speaking, I have to admit that Mediterranean countries – the countries of the south – have bigger problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece has a special problem. We have to be very sure that we can help everybody in order to have better absorption. It is our plan to make an effort to simplify the rules for absorption. That is why we will have a funding line in the framework of our CFP reform which will be much easier for the Member States to absorb.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring to Mr Tsoukalas’s question about the Mediterranean Regulation, we have decided that this Mediterranean Regulation has to be implemented. We have had to implement this regulation since 1 June, and there is no way back. If we were to amend this regulation, we would need two or three years without any control and compliance system, so we are going to implement this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already cooperated with the Greek authorities. I have explained to them that they have to implement this regulation without any further delay. That means, of course, that all the provisions about special types of gear that are very heavy for the environment have to be met. It also means that we are going to exhaust the margins from our fund possibilities to give them funding in order to compensate them. This is something I would like to say referring to boat seines, to trawlers and to all types of gear: they have to give us a good example of compliance. We will do our best in order to exhaust our funding margins to make it possible for them to have better gear and to improve the selectivity of their gear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
