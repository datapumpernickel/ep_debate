<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span>When the representative of the Commission first presented this report to the Committee on Fisheries, he stated that the subject was so technical (and even routine) that we may even find it boring. I disagree.</p>
<p class="contents">Devising and implementing technical measures aimed at protecting and conserving young fish is of crucial long-term importance to the fishing industry, as well as to the aim of achieving sustainability in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">If technical measures are unsuccessful, or are seen to be applied inequitably between fishing nations or types of fishery in a particular area, then the ultimate objective will not be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The timing of this particular proposal, on the heels of the December Fisheries Council and its decisions on CFP reform and interim cod recovery measures, provides an opportunity for the Commission and the Council to regain some of the credibility which currently is severely lacking – certainly around northern fishing nations such as Scotland and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments which were approved by the committee – and which I hope will be endorsed by the whole House tomorrow – include two, which simply correct inaccurate references in the Commission's text.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the others, Amendment No 2 seeks to ensure that the Council will have an input to the detailed rules in connection with the conditions under which combinations of net sizes may be carried. This is an area which the Commissioner will know has caused significant difficulty under the current regulation. It is unlikely that unilateral rewriting of such important rules by the Commission will help to restore any faith in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 addresses another – in my view – unacceptable anomaly, namely the provision which would allow those fishermen using the very smallest of mesh sizes in industrial fisheries for sandeel, for example, to retain undersized fish. The rationale that it is somehow acceptable to land undersized fish, provided it is not sold for human consumption, is totally impossible to justify to those involved in the whitefish sector who use the largest of mesh sizes, while suffering draconian cuts in their quotas and days at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments which were lost in committee have been retabled by my group. I seek full support for their inclusion tomorrow. The proposed establishment of Regional Advisory Councils, which was agreed, albeit in a watered-down form, as part of the reformed CFP, provides an ideal forum in which to involve stakeholders and to harness existing expertise. Unless RACs are to be given meaningful work to do, they will quickly become regarded as pointless talking-shops.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, if technical measures are to be supported and implemented by fishermen, it is essential that they accept that particular measures are appropriate to the task. It seems to me that this proposal provides the ideal opportunity to achieve these two worthwhile ends – the meaningful involvement of experts through RACs, and therefore a greater likelihood that technical measures will be effective and appropriate to a particular fishing zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Further amendments address the question of Member States' ability to take action, in relation to their own fleets, which exceeds the minimum required under EU regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The current version of the technical measures allows for this provision. It is mysterious, in my view, that this provision has somehow disappeared without adequate explanation from the new proposal. Surely if conservation is the objective and technical measures are utilised, it ought to be permitted for individual Member States to seek to achieve additional benefits if they deem it to be necessary This provision should also be able to be applied by Member States to their own fleets in waters other than Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge currently facing EU fisheries management is to somehow recover from a major crisis in confidence. Certainly in Scotland there is such a crisis, which has led my own political party, the SNP – a pro-European party – to commit itself to campaign for the scrapping of the CFP as currently formulated.</p>
<p class="contents">This week in the Westminster Parliament, a Bill will be tabled calling for UK withdrawal from the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless a dramatic change in attitude is forthcoming, such demonstrations of disgust with the process will continue to be expressed. I hope that the Commission can accept that there is a need for it to take the lead in changing the perceived 'we know best' attitude, which can lead to such resentment.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposal, not even mentioning Regional Advisory Councils once, is unacceptable. I hope that this omission can be corrected. I hope that Parliament will support all of the amendments tomorrow. I hope that the Commission too will accept that there is a need to change the way things are done, and done for the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, we are well aware in this House that many thousands of fishermen, processors and ancillary workers have suffered severe hardship as a result of the cod recovery proposals agreed by the Council last December. The whitefish fleet in Ireland and the UK in particular have been hardest hit, being forced to tie up their boats for half of every month and having their quotas cut by more than 50% on the days that they can fish. These interim measures have been in place since 1 February this year and yet not a single penny in compensation has been paid to any of those affected by the cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">It was salutary to note that Commissioner Fischler himself saw the need to call upon the Member States to live up to their responsibilities and apply for aid from the fisheries budget. He said that of the EUR 3.7 billion in the budget to 2006, only 3% had been earmarked for socio-economic aid, despite the obvious hardship suffered by many fishermen. In fact, in the UK the figure is 0%, which is a shameful indictment of the UK Government. Its failure to apply for this aid or indeed, to submit proposals for emergency aid from the EUR 150 million voted by a huge majority in this House in March, amounts to a naked betrayal of our fishing sector in their time of need.</p>
<p class="contents">No wonder more than 230 UK fishermen have applied to scrap their vessels. But decommissioning on such a scale, on top of the 20% who scrapped their vessels last year, could take the UK whitefish fleet below the critical mass needed to support the harbour workers, ancillary staff and processors on whom the remaining fishermen rely. If they go, the whole industry will collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is against this background that I must express my surprise at the Commission’s position on the Irish Box. It seems to me to be an utter paradox that the Commission can, on the one hand, support such a draconian regime to enable cod and other whitefish stocks to recover, while at the same time calling for the effective dismantling of the Irish Box.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Box is one of the most important nursery and spawning grounds in European waters. It is of vital importance as a conservation resource, as numerous scientific studies have demonstrated, and yet the Commission appears ready to accept the argument that restricted access in this zone somehow amounts to discrimination. Let us be quite clear about this. Of course there is restricted access within the Irish Box. That is why it is a conservation zone. But the Irish, British, French and Spanish fleets have been fishing in the Irish Box for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I am well aware that our Spanish friends are dissatisfied with the current arrangements which restrict access to only 40 of their trawlers. However, it is worth noting that the 40 Spanish trawlers fishing in this zone at any given time are all massive 25-metre plus vessels, often twice the size of local Irish boats. The problem is, there are a further 120 massive Spanish trawlers waiting just south of the Irish Box, keen to gain access, but I do not see hundreds of Greek or Italian trawlers demanding access to the Irish Box!</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting that the same proposal for a Council regulation in Western Waters would burst open the 200 mile economic exclusion zone around the Azores. Again this is an area of high sensitivity which has supported generations of local Portuguese fishermen, often braving the wild Atlantic gales in tiny, open wooden boats. Simply to throw these waters open to giant trawlers from Spain or anywhere else would be catastrophic both for conservation of fish stocks and for the preservation of jobs in the fragile Azorean fleet. We cannot allow this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I support my Spanish colleagues in many ways. I have worked hard to find compensation for the damage caused by the oil tanker <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. I have supported the international third-country agreements which are of such benefit and importance to the Andalucian and Galician fleets. But I cannot stand idly by and watch the destruction of key conservation zones around the Azores and in the Irish Box, simply because our Spanish friends and only our Spanish friends wish to catch more fish in these waters.</p>
<p class="contents">To accept this argument would be to fly in the face of conservation policy. Our job as parliamentarians, and my job as Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, is to ensure that fish stocks are allowed to recover. I therefore urge the House to accept the amendments tabled by the UEN Group and others to the Stevenson Report and in particular to support Amendment No 20, which calls upon the Irish Box to be maintained for a period of 10 years, with a review by ICES and STECF at the end of that period, to establish whether the policy of restricted access has assisted in meeting the objectives of the cod recovery plan in rebuilding endangered whitefish stocks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcomed the Commission’s Action Plan seeking to avert the negative social effects of the fisheries reform and we endorse the idea of addressing these negative effects through a compensation programme.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, a number of points in the Commission’s proposal give cause for concern in that, for example, the reference data put forward is obsolete, dating back to 2000. Three years have passed since then, and the Commission itself acknowledges that the assessment is largely theoretical. There is a need for a serious and detailed debate on the model to be adopted: whether to opt for industrial fisheries, involving a small number of large, modern economical vessels, or small-scale fisheries, involving a large number of small and medium-sized vessels, which may be less profitable but certainly employ more labour. Lastly, there is a need for an updated version of the Commission’s Action Plan, parts of which ought to have been updated in line with the conclusions of the Fisheries Council in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Commissioner, some parts of the proposal are unconvincing. For example, the Mediterranean is completely disregarded. The Commission does not take into consideration its specific nature but only a number of areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This amounts to cultural penalisation caused by historic long-sightedness in the process of European integration itself: our Europe continues to be purely north-facing. This was the case during the many years when the common agricultural policy was being developed and it is the case now as well with regard to the common fisheries policy. However, it is dangerous, first and foremost, because we are on the eve of the inauguration of the Mediterranean area of free trade in 2010, which will make the Mediterranean sea a major area of social, economic, human and political exchange for which we must be prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key aspect is job losses. The Commission appears to envisage the loss of 12 000 jobs, which are to be recouped over the space of four years. We feel this prediction is optimistic, in that it underestimates the impact of the reform, failing to take into account the consequences for related sectors, dockyards and the processing industries. It is estimated that the European processing industry alone employs at least 100 000 people. Above all, the Commission’s estimate fails to take into account the fact that it is unlikely that it will be possible to retrain workers, such as those in the fisheries sector, who, especially in some areas of Europe, have a low level of education and work in areas suffering from an extremely high unemployment rate. If we think we can recoup them and retrain them to do other jobs we are deluding ourselves, particularly where Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal are concerned. Then, in many countries, there are no welfare support provisions and fishermen would be in danger of becoming reject workers, superfluous citizens; another implicit risk is the social, cultural and economic desertification of many parts of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to focus aid on small-scale fisheries, seeing as they currently employ half the fishermen working in the sector and account for 75% of vessels. It is true that the level of catches is very low, but in terms of employment small-scale fisheries play a vital role. The Commission acknowledges that financial incentives to small-scale fisheries have not served much purpose, it acknowledges that further measures are needed, although they will be some time coming, and talks only of long-term perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">These considerations call forth the question of what resources to invest to mitigate the socio-economic consequences of this reform. We are opposed to reprogramming of the Structural Funds, considering, rather, that these funds should be reserved for other priorities. The fact that 80% of the regions concerned are Objective 1 and 2 regions means that the Structural Funds are currently necessary and crucial for addressing priorities which cannot be confused with the project contained in this resolution. In our opinion, we need to set up an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> fund, a measure which could even be temporary for implementing recovery plans.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, on the subject of women. The fact that 22% of the labour force is made up of women is not reflected at all in the Commission’s Action Plan. Overall, we support the long-term conclusions, but we feel that it would be appropriate to reformulate some parts of the Action Plan and to analyse the socio-economic impact of the reform more carefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Hudghton, Mr Stevenson and Mr Fava, for your reports on our proposals. I will turn to Mr Hudghton's report first.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission's proposal covers a substantial amount of the regulation on technical measures. You said there is little interest because the proposal is so technical. Yes, but there is no other option: a proposal on technical measures has to be very technical. Furthermore, as a result of the problems with the cod and hake stocks, a number of Commission and Council regulations have been adopted which supplement or amend the regulation on technical measures. One of the main objectives of our proposal is therefore to draw together all these provisions, which are contained in many separate regulations, into a single regulation and thus make them far more manageable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also used this proposal, however, to introduce a number of new elements. There are three issues which arise here: firstly, we want to harmonise the provisions on the individual species of fish which are caught using trawl nets of various mesh sizes in all the Community waters in the north-east Atlantic. We want to avoid a situation in future in which a fishing vessel, which has been fishing in the Bay of Biscay, for example, and wants to continue fishing south of Ireland, is subject to different catch conditions. The harmonisation will also extend to the waters of the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, where separate provisions currently apply. Secondly, the rules should also apply to ships of less than 12 metres in order to provide better protection for young hake. Thirdly, we want to amend the provisions on grading the catches in order to reduce discards. We also propose setting out the detailed rules in Commission regulations, such as the percentage composition of the catches if fishing vessels carry trawl nets with two different mesh sizes on board, or the physical dimensions and immersion times for static nets.</p>
<p class="contents">On your question regarding the regional advisory councils, Mr Hudghton: as you know, we<span class="italic"> </span>have re-established these advisory councils as part of the reform and they are also included in the basic regulation. This basic regulation states that the advisory councils can be consulted. We cannot change this option envisaged in the basic regulation and make it a general obligation in a secondary regulation; there are legal obstacles to this. However, I can tell you that we ourselves have a massive interest in ensuring that these advisory councils are consulted as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, technical measures are certainly no longer enough on their own – as we all know – to achieve sustainability in fisheries. For more than a decade, scientists have therefore been demanding the management of the fishing effort as well to enable a sustainable conservation policy to be pursued. That is precisely what we are aiming for with our proposal on the western waters which is dealt with in the Stevenson report. As you know, the special provisions on access by Spanish and Portuguese ships to the Irish Box and on access to the Portuguese coastal waters lost their legal basis from 1 January 2003. However, as the relevant regulations from 1995 did not establish any time limit for the western waters, we must remove the legal uncertainty which exists here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore proposing a new regulation to replace the existing regulations, containing the following provisions: we want to restrict the fishing effort in the ICES sub-areas of the western waters for all Member States in a non-discriminatory way. We propose defining the fishing effort so that the reduction in fishing opportunities since 1995 and the actual fishing effort deployed between 1998 and 2002 are taken into account. We want to limit the fishing effort for pelagic species as well and we want further restrictions on access to waters in the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think anyone should create a threat scenario here and be alarmed about the prospect of a Spanish armada. As we have seen in recent months, that is really not the case. We must not forget that the aim is to restrict the fishing effort in general and the issue of relative stability comes into play here. It is therefore inappropriate to act as if the Spanish fishing boats were fishing the waters dry.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one other thing clear: the proposal before us is based exclusively on scientific evidence, which was not the case with the old Irish Box.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn briefly to Mr Fava's report, which deals with the Action Plan to counter the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of the EU fishing industry. We have attempted, in consultation with the Member States, to assess the potential job losses and the need for financial resources to alleviate the socio-economic impacts. We have held meetings in the Member States – one last September, and one this April – and we also consulted the fishing sector, the stakeholders, in January. Your report, Mr Fava, contains fifteen recommendations which I can broadly endorse because they comply with the general guidelines of the common fisheries policy and support the long-term goals of our Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an initial presentation and I will of course be pleased to answer your questions at the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Allow me to point out that the Common Fisheries Policy is funded almost entirely by means of the Union’s budget. But it does not even represent 1% of the whole budget, and is funded by the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), the regional fund and the social fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan is intended to alleviate the short-term consequences for fishermen and the fishing industry resulting from the conservation and protection measures, by means of the reprogramming of the FIFG for social measures and a review of all the existing aid, but it also provides for the possible release of additional sums.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries which has incorporated the following points of the Committee on Budgets into the Resolution:</p>
<p class="contents">The first stresses that it is not probable that the Council’s amendments to the Commission’s package on the reform of the CFP, adopted at its meeting of 16 to 22 December 2002, will facilitate the application of this reform nor the scheduled reprogramming of 611 million from the FIFG.</p>
<p class="contents">The second points out that the financial resources available in heading 2 of the financial perspectives intended for the fisheries sector and the areas dependent on fishing can be calculated at EUR 28 000 million for the period 2000-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is stressed that additional European Union funding can only be allocated to fishing measures intended to compensate for losses if this is compatible with the maximum limit in heading 2 of the financial perspectives, or by employing the flexibility instrument laid down in Article 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the three reports we are dealing with tonight, Mr Fava, Mr Stevenson and Mr Hudghton, and I would also like to say to the latter, Mr Hudghton, that I agree with many of the comments he made in his speech. I would also like to condemn the conceit of the Commission, which takes decisions behind the backs of the sector, the lack of communication between scientists and fishermen and I agree with him that none of this helps in promoting a credible image of Europe amongst our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The time available for this debate is limited, and the issues dealt with by these three reports are very important. I will restrict myself to a brief comment on each of them. I believe that these three reports, particularly when debated together in this way, demonstrate the contradictory way in which the Commission presents its proposals on reform of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Fava on the action plan to counteract the social, economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of this industry in the European Union raises the need for the Community to deal with the losses with sufficient financial resources and without so much uncertainty, particularly in terms of employment, which this reform of the CFP will cause in the regions dependent on fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries is requesting additional funding to alleviate the effects of this reform. The Commission must ensure that the socio-economic structure of these areas is maintained. It will be cheaper to support the maintenance of the existing socio-economic fabric than to stand back and watch it disappear and then try to create other replacement economic activities, with which these regions – and I agree with Mr Stevenson – would have great difficulties, since they are located in peripheral areas and suffer from a lack of professional training, new technologies, infrastructures and access to the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is well aware that each job on a ship generates from 4 to 5 jobs on land, and therefore the disappearance of fishing would cause serious disruption to the socio-economic fabric of these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report on the management of fishing in relation to certain areas and resources, I believe that, when drawing up resolutions, we Members of Parliament must take account of reality. And the reality is that the transitional period following the accession of Spain and Portugal has come to an end. The CFP has quite enough exceptions already without restoring and perpetuating those which at one time were mere transitional mechanisms. Mr Stevenson, this exception, which has come to an end, is not one favour which is being exchanged for another. If anybody has led you to believe this, I am very sorry, because it has come to an end. It is a problem of legal basis and it has come to an end, and it is not being exchanged for anything. You helped us in Morocco; we will help you as much as we can, but the exception has ended.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my group supports the Commission's proposal on the protection of juveniles. Correct and effective technical measures should be the basis for achieving the balance between fleet and resources. The excessive scrapping which some people want to see is anti-economic and antisocial, and could lead us to a situation in a few years when we have created sufficient quantities of fish but do not have either the ships or the fishermen to catch them. With regard specifically to the Irish Box, I believe that to use 1998-2002 to measure fishing is far too little, it is shameful.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the consultative committees, I support this measure, but quite frankly I would like the Commission to clarify whether all the Member States are currently in an equal position to implement this new element. I would like to know whether we are all in an equal position, because, if we are not, we would be generating a new source of disparity, of unequal treatment and injustice, and I am told by the sector in my country that we are not all in an equal position.</p>

There is a reason for this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Hudghton report, I should like to say that it is crucial in future to really involve regional consultative committees in order to keep, and use, the mix of science and hands-on knowledge as closely to fishing as possible, thus giving us information and allowing the topic to be approached from a more European point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few comments with regard to the Fava report. These are tough times, of course. There must be severe cut-backs, as the Fisheries Council decided in December 2002. There is a plan to cushion the negative social and economic impact of restructuring, which is necessary and unavoidable. It is particularly unfortunate and regrettable for people who are hit by it. I set great store by implementing the plan as effectively as possible, and this should be backed up by the necessary resources. It is important, in my view, for the sector itself to be involved in the plans that are required to offer these people new opportunities. Money on its own cannot offer a structural, long-term solution. In recent years, subsidies have been granted continuously to the small-scale sector that was facing difficult times, but this money has not led to a smoothly-running small-scale fishing industry. Therefore, if resources are deployed, it should be with the intention that the sector can ultimately help itself and take its future into its own hands. I have already tabled amendments to this effect in the past. Structural change, offering alternatives, is what is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States also have an important role to play, not only by handing out subsidies but also by changing policy, setting up new tasks and creating new opportunities for the sector in society. I think that we should indeed learn from this experience, and I hope that we can maintain a balanced policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the name of non-discrimination between Member States and on the pretext that the transitional period for fully integrating Portugal and Spain into the common fisheries policy has ended, this proposal seeks to eliminate the division between their fishing zones, making it difficult to adopt measures to control the fishing effort and calling into question the guarantee of the sustainability of resources in Portuguese waters. This proposal would mean opening up access for Spanish vessels to the zone between 12 and 200 miles from the exclusive economic zone, thereby creating an enormous border-free fishing zone. Given the size of the Spanish fleet, this would not only have devastating effects on fisheries resources, with serious consequences for Portuguese fishermen, but it would also nullify the measures for resource conservation that Portugal has implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of maintaining the division of the ICES statistical fishing sub-areas IX and X and the FCECA<span class="bold"> </span>areas. This cannot be called discrimination between states. Discrimination exists when situations that are different and specific are considered to be equal, as is the case with Portuguese fishing. We must therefore take account of the specific arrangements for access by Portuguese and Spanish vessels to the waters of Portugal and Spain respectively, without setting an end date.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would also like to mention the specific situation of the outermost regions and the need to preserve existing derogations for access to their exclusive economic zone, as laid down in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1985 there has been a provision in the technical measures regulation to allow Member States to impose stricter measures for their own fishermen in EU waters. They could not do this for other fishermen, but only for their own. Now the Commission has proposed the removal of this provision in the revised regulation. We have raised this matter in the Committee on Fisheries many times and the Commission says that this provision is redundant, that Article 10 in the new basic regulation allows Member States to enact stricter measures for their vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">This right is limited to their own waters, at least so the Commission said in January when it more or less forced Sweden to exploit the depleted cod stocks in the Baltic and the North Sea. So, if this provision is removed from the technical measures regulation, as the Commission is proposing, then Member States will not be able to impose stricter measures outside their own waters. I would like to know from the Commission why it considers this undesirable now, after almost twenty years? Does it not fly in the face of wanting to persuade Member States to be more responsible and, if they are more responsible, allow them to be?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of hypocrisy here. I would like to ask people to support Mr Hudghton's amendments, which would actually bring the regulation back to what he originally wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Irish Box, it makes no sense whatsoever in an important nursery and spawning area to try and increase the number of vessels that are going in there, to open up the Irish Box. If the Commission is being consistent in wanting to have a more ecological and sustainable approach to fishing, then surely it should not do that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also hypocrisy in this Parliament in relation to ICES, because regarding the cod stocks, even the Commission would not go as far as ICES wanted. Therefore some people want to accept the advice of ICES only when it suits.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot allow what is going to happen to the Irish Box to go ahead. It completely flies in the face of conservation and sustainable fishing and there is no justification for it. We would like to see our amendment supported tomorrow during the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a political one. I regret that the Commission, from the outset, has chosen the political box option. In my opinion, the Commission's approach to this whole problem is a negation of its responsibility on conservation and sustainability of stocks and a recipe for conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Belligerence between Spanish and Irish fishermen and the destruction of fishing gear inside the Irish Box have recently been reported. This must be seen as a new and worrying development. Not only fishermen, but also the general public of Ireland see the Irish Box as being of serious concern to them. It is perceived as one of the big Member States using bully-boy tactics to impose its will to the detriment of a small nation such as Ireland or Portugal. The people of Ireland are asking if this is a foretaste of what is in store for the smaller nation in post-Convention Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with the people of Ireland. Let me reiterate and emphasise that the area known as the Irish Box is a rich fishing area with a high concentration of juvenile fish and spawning grounds. It is crucial that the EU applies restrictions on a fishing effort within this area. It is vital that the Irish Box is maintained as a biologically sensitive zone.</p>
<p class="contents">It beggars belief that the Commission is unable to produce any specific scientific report it has used in preparing this proposal. It further beggars belief that the Commission omitted any reference to the biologically sensitive nature of the Irish Box in the current proposal. We must ask why. Let me remind the Commission that Council Regulation (EC) No 1275/94 specifically recognised the biological sensitivity of the Irish Box, and yet the Commission broke this important link.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's revised proposal, diplomatically referred to as the Council's compromise – the one we are not being consulted on – the biologically sensitive nature of the Irish Box is back. Today not only Irish but also Portuguese waters are under attack. Tomorrow it will be the Shetland waters. After that, God only knows.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this Parliament is serious about fisheries conservation. I know that it is serious about sustainability of stocks. I have therefore tabled amendments for the plenary which address both of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of Ireland's entire fishing industry and the survival of all Ireland's coastal communities may depend on your support. I ask you for your support for my amendments in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paisley (NI).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Irish fishermen both from the North and from the South whose home waters are those of the Irish sea are now staring in dismay at what is happening to their industry. There is no doubt that this matter of the Irish Box is all-important. All the sacrifices they made were argued about before, but now all those sacrifices were in vain, because the Commission now takes a different line and says the box has got to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come when this House must face up to the fact that the fishermen from the North and the South of Ireland, for the first time in history, have come together to face this particular problem. It is a serious problem, it is a problem that is causing people who were pro-European Parliament to turn against this Parliament. This is a serious matter, and I trust that tonight the Commissioner will take this to heart and to his very soul.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishermen are looking for a fundamental review of the current quota system, they are looking for a review of the tie-up policies, they are looking for a review of the direction of the Common Fisheries Policy, they are looking for a review of the best way to achieve proper cod recovery and to achieve the recovery of other fish stocks. These are matters that must be faced, they cannot be swept away. I appeal to the Commissioner to come to Ireland, both North and South, hear the fisherman at first hand and act for them and the future of this industry.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am disappointed by this debate as it seems like a hotchpotch of national interests and I am hearing very little about Europe, but rather a defence of the conservation of resources which responds entirely to each of the parties’ own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission must play a significant role in defending European interests. Everyone is looking after number one, and that is not what we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, or rather the four, I would like to congratulate Mr Ó Neachtain, because he produced the report – Mr Stevenson’s name now only appears as chairman, despite the fact that the amendments presented to the plenary come from the UEN Group, although they have also been signed by Members with national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say nothing about the report by Mr Fava since we are all going to accept it and I believe there is little controversy about it. With regard to the reports by Mr Hudghton and Mr Stevenson, I would like to say that I support what has emerged from the Committee on Fisheries, which is our specialised and competent committee. What subsequently emerges from the politics in the plenary is another issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Mr Hudghton’s report. I would simply like to say that on the issue of the regional consultative committees, I agree with him, that they are consultative. We must listen to the regions, we must listen to the sectors. We have said this in Parliament and it has been said in the Council, but of course Parliament and the Council will then have the final word, because consultations are obligatory, but there is a common policy and common European bodies which must take these decisions after listening to the sectors in all regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Stevenson report, there are two fundamental principles: firstly, the conservation of resources; secondly, equality of Member States. They are two principles which the Commission must accept. We have scrupulous respect for the conservation measures. We want a genuine sustainable fisheries policy, responsible fishing, with all the necessary measures, including fishing bans. If there are areas in which there are reproductions, of juvenile and restocking fish, there must not be any fishing, nobody fishes. And that is the way to create healthy biological bans. This must be made absolutely clear. These sensitive areas must therefore be sensitive. But this must be balanced with a second principle, which is the need for the Community principle of not discriminating against any State for reasons of nationality and therefore all these conservation measures must be taken in a manner that affects everyone, not benefiting some and harming others; that would be an anti-Community measure and would end up in the courts, the Court of Justice in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this is not necessary so that the Member States, which have actually come to the end of their transitional period of 17 years – the longest transitional period in the history of the European Union – whose rights have been restricted for these 17 years, can now accede under equal conditions. The conservation measures must therefore affect everybody. There are measures, as the Commissioner knows, which consist of limiting the ACRs, fishing days, the capacity of fleets, all of which are selective technical measures. There are many measures, but they must clearly be applied equally to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">It is discriminatory, Commissioner, because the period intended to be used as a reference is 1998-2002, years during which there were two countries – Spain and Portugal – whose rights were restricted or limited. They are therefore not operating under equal conditions if we take that period as a reference.</p>
<p class="contents">We are naturally against the amendments which will be presented tomorrow by the UEN Group and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, because we believe there are other ways to conserve resources without discriminating against certain States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like you to clarify whether we are discussing the first proposal you made or the proposal which is already in the Council and on which there is an agreement, as certain Members have said. If that is the case, I would ask that this Parliament be consulted again and if it is not, we will use all the rights this House enjoys to see that it is.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the political decisions adopted in this House will have to be respected, but I would insist that what has been debated here today has been a hotchpotch of national interests, unfortunately for fishing, and that is not something which I, as an MEP, wanted to see. And the Commission is not playing the leading role it should playing in terms of a conservation of resources in the sensitive areas of Europe which affects every one of the Member States in an equal manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are essential to provide a dialogue with all interested sectors. However, I would like to concentrate on what is now called the 'Stevenson report'.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Ó Neachtain for all his work on what was originally his report. I regret that he had to move his name from the report but I also understand that he was left with no option.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal from the Council seeks to put in place a new regime for fishing effort in Atlantic waters and a system of fishing effort management, concerning certain Community fishing areas and resources. However, on the one hand it would appear that the proposal looks for a management instrument to ensure no increase in fishing efforts, but on the other hand the issue of access of Spanish vessels into what is known as the 'Irish Box' becomes a matter of real concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole issue rests on the question of access to the Irish Box – water within 50 miles of the Irish coast. This area is an important spawning ground, rich in juvenile fish. This sensitive biological area deserves protection. Thus it is vital that the EU restricts the fishing effort in the Irish Box in order that future generations can enjoy a sustainable fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Box was specially recognised as an area of biological sensitivity. However, this report as it stands, instead of applying the policy of sustainable development, would open up this area of sensitivity to over-exploitation. As reports in the <span class="italic">Irish Examiner</span> note, fishermen are primarily concerned that fish stocks will be decimated if the Spanish fleet gains unlimited access to the Irish Box. Even the Irish Marine Minister expressed his frustration that he could not get the European Commission to give its opinion on the legal status of the Irish Box. I understand that there has now been some communication in this matter and that there is tentative compromise on the table, although the Irish and Spanish ministers are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I too share my Irish colleagues' concerns that, as Mr Ó Neachtain stated in the <span class="italic">Irish Examiner</span>, we could find these waters completely fished-out in no time at all. I would therefore like to ask colleagues to recognise the importance of boxes in scientifically sensitive areas. I understand that this is not just a north versus south issue. My colleagues from Portugal also value the sensitivity of boxes, especially concerning the Azores. If we are truly serious about a common fisheries policy, I believe that boxes are an important management tool, in recognition of biologically sensitive areas. This is not about discrimination. Far from it. This is about ensuring a sustainable fishery for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that colleagues will support the amendments tabled, especially Amendment No 20, and make sure that the vision Mr Ó Neachtain had is seen through in this report.</p>

We must ensure proper protection for sensitive nursery and spawning grounds such as the Irish Box. Sustainability also requires the use of technical measures as dealt with in the Hudghton report, but these are most effective when they have the full support of those engaged in fishing. Indeed, fishers may become pioneers in the area as happened in Scotland with the square mesh panel. Therefore we thoroughly endorse the involvement of regional advisory councils in decisions on technical measures and we hope for the speedy establishment of such councils.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the Fava report and the sustainability of the fisheries industry, decommissioning may be good for marine resources, but if fleets are reduced too far then the industry simply cannot survive. Even with a moderate level of reduction, effects on communities are severe. Help is urgently needed. Only today we have heard that the Commission has declared that what seems to be an eminently sensible arrangement in Scotland concerning quotas, is not compatible with common market rules.</p>
<p class="contents">How many more blows are our fishing communities supposed to take before faith in the European project is finally lost? When we see what is happening to them, even the most committed amongst us may begin to have our doubts. Please let us act with the sustainability of resources and of industry and with communities in mind. If we do not, it may be too late on all counts.</p>

For different reasons, none of them are optimistic about the Commission's proposals for the fisheries sector. Globally speaking, the Commission's proposals keep to the traditional path of ignoring the benefits gained from the knowledge and experience of fishermen. As a consequence, trust in the Commission's ability to operate a successful Community fisheries policy is at its lowest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fava mentioned that the Commission recognises that aid measures in favour of small-scale fisheries have not succeeded, and how no immediate action to protect them is planned, in spite of the fact that these small-scale fisheries employ 44% of all fishermen in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The original advisory councils provided for in the common fisheries policy Green Paper are somewhat neglected, while the need for these regional advisory councils is more urgent than ever, as a different approach from that of the governmental policy of Member States. On that, let me take one enlightened sample from recent days. The whole Bay of Biscay fishing fleet has this week remained in harbour because of the significant reduction in overall fishing possibilities due to the pollution caused by the wreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. The Spanish authorities promised a scientific report on the consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> wreck. To date, no direct scientific or biological survey of the fishing areas has been made. The Spanish authorities claim, and I quote: '<span class="italic">que no se puede establecer una relación causal entre el vertido del 'Prestige' y la escasez de capturas</span>'.</p>
<p class="contents">It is somewhat disappointing and regrettable that the Commission ignores in its proposals what Commissioner Fischler said in London when addressing the fishermen, that is, 'become full players in the fisheries management process'. An excellent message indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that the principle of sustainability based on scientific criteria must, of course, be observed when exploiting the sea’s resources, but the principle of non-discrimination must also apply, although this must be duly combined and complemented with the principle of relative stability, which is also important.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank those colleagues who, together with Mrs Figueiredo, voted for my amendment on access to waters in the Azores region. In fact, as has already been stated, this is an extremely sensitive situation, with a very complex ecological balance, and enormous care must be taken in granting access to these waters, since fish are concentrated in a tiny part of these waters, in the furthest reaches of the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also wish to support the Commission’s intention, expressed in this proposal for a report, to continue the specific arrangements with regard to access to the waters lying between Portugal and Spain. This was, in fact, decided in 1995, by common agreement between the two countries, and has had the support of the Commission and the Council. We hope that these arrangements can continue, because they are the best way of pursuing responsible fishing and a climate of peace between the fishing communities of the two countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Things are also difficult, however, for all those who believe in sustainable development and in the need to reverse the trend of over-exploiting fishery resources and of exterminating species, which is leading our oceans and, with them, our fishing communities, to disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s original proposal for the Western Waters and the Stevenson report both seek to uphold and strengthen existing legislation protecting the resources of Portugal’s Western Waters. Nevertheless, to our great surprise – as Mrs Figueiredo has already said – we have just discovered that the Council is preparing to dismantle all existing protection. The Council’s current position is an invitation to plunder and devastate the Western Waters, flying in the face of the scientific reports that conclude that there is an urgent need to restrict, rather than extend, access to the waters, it ignores the positions and interests of fishing communities and will, if adopted, inevitably lead to an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the answer you gave to my parliamentary question on the validity of the current regulations. You said at the time, Commissioner, in Question No 26: ‘… the Commission has a clear understanding of the validity of Regulations Nos 685 and 2027. Unless amended or repealed by the Community legislator, the rules established by the regulations will continue to apply.’ This is the opposite of what you have just said here! I fail to understand how your opinion can change completely in only three months! I should also like to clarify the following point: the rules for the accession of Portugal and Spain to the European Communities expired in 1995. We are not in a transitional period! A new set of regulations was adopted in 1995 to apply thereafter, with the agreement of everyone! This is what you now want to blow out of the water, to call into question in order to ruin Portuguese waters. This is completely unacceptable. I wish to conclude, furthermore, by saying that equality between those in completely different situations is nothing but humbug and not equality at all. We want to see equality between situations that are equal, not a pretence of equality that serves only to cover up a policy of destroying our resources. For this very reason, I wish to support the rapporteur and to call on all Members to vote for Amendment No 20 of this report tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to ask you to clarify a few points regarding Mr Fava’s report, if possible, since you have said that you essentially endorse the proposals it contains. Mr Fava’s report – which we will support tomorrow – states that the data on which your proposals are based is not up to date and is therefore not particularly reliable: the forecast of 12 000 jobs losses is underestimated and the retraining of the workforce envisaged is virtually impossible given the level of education of the people concerned. Mr Fava has pointed all this out today too, and yet you say that you are essentially in agreement. I fail to understand how you can support the report considering the proposals made.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the Committee on Budgets points out that there is not enough money and that the constraints are such as to exclude additional funding. Well then, if you, with your imagination, could manage to dream something up, we would be truly delighted. I would propose, and I am anxious to hear your opinion, in view of these budgetary difficulties, giving some of the responsibility back to the Member States – we are going to call for this in another report – allowing them, for example, to apply the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rule to fisheries too, a rule with which you are quite familiar since it is employed in agriculture as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other issue under consideration is concerned, I confess I am a little disappointed by the debate. The excessively nationalistic overtones make me genuinely of the opinion that there is no longer any point in having a common fisheries policy. Whether we are talking about Portuguese, Irish or Spanish waters, clearly the scope for debate is reduced by such attitudes. During these periods of genuine difficulty – I am thinking of the serious issues affecting fishermen and their families – the only certain point of reference is the law. By respecting the law, we will be able to reconcile environmental sustainability with rights, the Treaties and the agreements. It is our only safeguard against shifting towards national policies and the only guarantee of our being able to pursue a common policy in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The maintenance of the <span class="italic">Irish Box</span> is not justified from either a scientific point of view or a legal point of view; it consists of a political concession granted to a country 18 years ago, to make it possible to reach an agreement on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The restriction of access to a fishing area cannot be extended indefinitely, particularly if it affects a specific fleet. Several judgments clearly indicate that the rules relating to equal treatment laid down in Community legislation not only prohibit explicit discrimination on grounds of nationality, but also prohibit any disguised form of discrimination by means of the application of differentiation criteria which have the same effect in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The transitional period for Spain's accession to the European Union ended in December 2002, and from January this year all restrictions should have disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">From a scientific point of view, any measure for the conservation of resources is justified, provided that is not discriminatory. In the case of the Irish Box, the measures advocated by some people go even further than the initiatives recently taken to protect cod stocks, a species whose situation cannot be compared with the situation of angler fish, hake or john dory in the Irish Box.</p>
<p class="contents">The Act of Accession to the European Union by Spain and Portugal contains the explicit decision to remove all restrictions of access to Community waters in December 2002; legally, for reasons of legislative hierarchy which everybody, from the legal expert to the uninitiated in law, understand, the Regulations of 94 and 95 cannot replace the Act of Accession.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commissioner forces the banks in our country to resolve his problem of too much tonnage in EU waters by driving our Irish fishing fleet into bankruptcy. Yes, you will get there, but I seriously question whether this is a method that we should even contemplate at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">If we reduce the fishing effort to such an extent that fishermen cannot meet their legitimate repayments there is no future for them. Yes, you will possibly achieve your goal, but at what cost to this most important industry?</p>
<p class="contents">I come back to the issue of the Irish Box. Yes, Commissioner, there is no need to paint the picture of the return of the Spanish Armada. There are 40 Spanish factory vessels in the Irish Box as we speak. They are allowed in there at the moment. The issue here is whether another 120 should be allowed into this very biologically sensitive area, not just the 40 that are there, but three or four times as many. There is no discrimination against the Spanish fleet. They are there now, as well as the French, Belgians and the Irish. But the present numbers of Spanish vessels in the Irish Box hoover up more fish than the whole Irish fishing effort can do itself. There is something wrong with a system that allows that off the coastal waters of Ireland. Are these not our waters in that sense? The very name 'Irish Box' I accept is emotive, but this is an issue in which we must have equity.</p>
<p class="contents">If we base our discussion and our debate on the advice of our scientists, on ICES and others who insist that for conservation we must restrict fishing effort in this area, in these most sensitive spawning and nursery grounds, if we follow that line we must be absolutely consistent and restrict right through. You cannot say to the French, the Belgians and the Irish 'no, you must restrict your effort', while at the same time effectively say to the Spaniards 'you can increase your effort four-fold. There is no equity in that. No discrimination against the Spaniards is intended here. If we go with the scientific argument, let us have some scientific rigour and be consistent and fair all round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have followed your arguments carefully and would now like to comment on the individual amendments that have been proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start with the Hudghton report. In Amendments Nos 1 and 3, you draw attention to errors in the references in our proposal. Thank you for pointing this out. We will of course correct these mistakes. As regards Amendment No 2, we prefer to set out the provisions on the use of combinations of towed nets of more than one range of mesh size in a single Commission regulation, as this opens up more options for discussion and technical consultation with the experts from the Member States. Amendment No 4 concerns industrial fishing, where by-catches of undersized fish and other species undeniably occur, that is true. However, I should remind you in this context that in this fisheries sector, a maximum of 5% by-catch is permitted, and controls carried out primarily by ICES have revealed that in practice, the by-catch falls well below this 5% limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 8 and 10 on the regional advisory councils, as I have already pointed out, are redundant here, in my view. The new framework regulation already states that we will consult these regional bodies where there is a regional aspect to a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are redundant because their content is already included in the new framework regulation on the common fisheries policy. I can accept Amendment No 9 to the extent that I can take up the reference to the new framework regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to clarify one point, because Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna asked whether I was referring to the first or the second Commission proposal. There is only one Commission proposal. There is also the report on the proposal, and my statement. What you mean, perhaps, is a non-paper which the Greek Presidency presented for discussion, but it is not a Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the Stevenson report. The proposals relate to the western waters. I am happy to accept Amendments Nos 2 to 5 as they are entirely in line with the objectives contained in our proposal. However, I cannot accept Amendment No 6 as it would delete the recital which sets out the basic concept underlying our proposed regulation, namely to ensure that there is no increase in the overall levels of the fishing effort in the western waters and that the fishing effort is calculated on the basis of the fishing effort actually deployed to date in these fisheries. I can endorse Amendment No 10 in principle, although the right place for this text is in the recitals, not in the enacting terms of the regulation. I do not think that Amendment No 17 is necessary, as we are safeguarding the monitoring of the fishing effort through the proposal's other provisions. The inclusion of a clause on changes to the system is acceptable, however, so I endorse Amendment No 19. Unfortunately, I must reject Amendments Nos 20 to 29. I would like to make it clear at this point that the Irish Box is a thing of the past. There is no going back. Free access to the waters beyond the 12-mile zone is a fundamental principle of the common fisheries policy. It can be restricted if stock conservation measures warrant such a measure. However, such restrictions must then apply equally and without discrimination to all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 30 concerns relative stability. This principle is already contained in the new framework regulation for the common fisheries policy and therefore does not need to be rolled out again here. As regards the outermost regions, I can accept Amendments Nos 8 and 13 to the extent that we should also restrict access to stocks other than tuna and related species, in order to protect the interests of local fisherman more effectively. However, this need not apply to the whole 200-mile zone. This should be looked at in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the pelagic stocks, I must unfortunately reject Amendments Nos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 18. If practical problems arise due to the migration of stocks between the various ICES areas or sub-areas, the areas for the maximum permissible fishing effort can be extended without any difficulty to several sub-areas or to the whole western waters, instead of applying per sub-area. However, we cannot resolve potential problems of this kind by removing the pelagic species from the regulation altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am happy to accept your Amendment No 1 regarding the adaptation of the text reference to the new framework regulation on the common fisheries policy. The same applies to Amendment No 7, which relates to scientific and biological surveys and Amendment No 9 on satellite monitoring systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the Fava report on our Action Plan to alleviate the social impacts. As regards paragraph 11 of the resolution on the inclusion of employment and health and safety conditions at work, I should point out that these objectives are already taken into account in the common fisheries policy. I am happy to comply with paragraph 5 of your resolution to the extent that we can always update the Action Plan when the Member States supply us with information on the socio-economic impacts for any future stock recovery plan or multiannual management plan. We have already fulfilled the demands set out in paragraph 13 on consultation with Member States and the fisheries sector. With regard to paragraphs 7, 8 and 9, let me say that I reminded the Member States, at the Fisheries Council on 26 May, that they should supply the Commission by 15 June this year with precise details of the additional funds needed to deal with the socio-economic impacts of the stock recovery plan for cod. To date, only the United Kingdom has provided more precise data, but it has indicated that it is seeking to cover the additional financial requirements from national funds. However, no other Member State has provided any data as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I also asked for information to be provided to us on whether and how the Member States wish to revise their original programme planning in order to boost support for socio-economic measures. Without this information from the Member States, we will all – the Commission and the Parliament alike – have difficulties in complying with this year's European Parliament resolution. We will also be unable to convince the budgetary authorities of the need to make as much as EUR 150 million in additional funding available via the flexibility instrument to alleviate the crisis in the white fish sector if no such demands are forthcoming from the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now he has said that regional advisory councils will be consulted where there is a regional aspect to a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, whose prerogative is it to decide when and on what RACs will be consulted. In particular, does he accept that technical measures, if they are to be meaningful, must be tailored to regions, and that therefore there is a regional aspect. Therefore will or will not regional advisory councils be consulted on this technical measures report? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question whether it is meaningful and necessary, or regarded as necessary, to consult such a body must arise from the given situation. What I drew attention to is this: the basic regulation provides for the option of consulting the advisory councils, and it is therefore not possible to transform this into obligatory consultation in a secondary provision. However, I can solemnly pledge, on the Commission's behalf, that we will always consult the relevant advisory council, if one exists, as a matter of course where there is a regional aspect to a proposal on a region of the sea. After all, we ourselves have an interest in obtaining the greatest possible range of clear and detailed information on the meaningful deployment of technical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Casaca's comments: yes, of course, what was said in the answer to the question continues to apply. However, you do need to consider one thing: you said that the provision of the Accession Treaty automatically continues in force. Perhaps this was not translated quite correctly. This certainly cannot apply, as this provision of the Accession Treaty, as is well known, has already expired. Currently, the situation is this, to be precise: according to the Commission's Legal Service, the legal basis has expired, but legislation is required to repeal the relevant provision of the regulation as well. It does not become invalid of its own accord. However, there is a view in the Council's Legal Service that due to the expiry of the legal basis, this provision of the regulation also forfeits its legal force. There are therefore two conflicting legal opinions here. As would seem logical, I informed you about the Commission's legal opinion in my reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
