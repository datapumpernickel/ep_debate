<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I addressed the REX Committee on this subject on 13 July and the issue was subsequently debated at the General Affairs Council of 26 April.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to hormones, as you know the definitive risk assessment which the Commission initiated last year after the appellant body ruled against us, will not be completed before the expiry of the reasonable delaying period which was allotted on 13 May. But, the Commission received an interim report from the scientists last weekend and we shall be having a first discussion of it at our meeting tomorrow. It is premature, therefore, for me to comment on the scientific data which has only just become available on this question or on the conclusions that we should attach to that data in the context of the WTO case in Geneva. As I have said, we will have a first discussion on the scientific reports tomorrow but we do not envisage drawing conclusions until a later meeting. But I can say one or two things which I think are of some importance now.</p>
<p class="contents">I should stress that there is no reason whatsoever for a new urgent decision to be taken on public health grounds or for there to be any kind of panic. The reason for that is very simple: it is that there is a complete ban on the use of hormones in the European Community and the import of meat that has been treated with hormones, so that public health cannot be affected just because the scientific reports that have just come out have been published, however they are interpreted. So the question now that we all have to consider is not what shall we do to protect public health, which is adequately protected, but, rather, what implications do these latest reports have for the handling of the WTO issue? That is obviously something which needs very careful consideration. It is primarily a legal and economic issue now, and not a public health one.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in the light of the various positions expressed in Parliament, I would like to stress the following. First of all the Commission of course shares the commitment of Parliament to the highest possible level of food security for European consumers. Secondly, we are of course committed to fulfilling our international obligations under the WTO. There is no reason why these two objectives should be contradictory. If the scientific evidence warrants it, the existing ban, which fully protects the European consumer, can remain. But it is important from the point of view of handling the issue in the WTO that there should be the maximum transparency with regard to our new scientific information. If it is to be persuasive internationally we will have to be clear as to the extent to which it is a new analysis of existing material and the extent to which it is based on new studies. It is likely and it would be reasonable for us to be asked to disclose any such new studies whether now or when they are finally completed. I therefore intend to ensure that all our scientific data – which will be accessible to everyone on the Internet – is discussed with our scientific counterparts in the US and Canada, with the objective of seeking greater consensus on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The data now available since the weekend may represent an important addition to the debate on this issue. I hope that scientists and regulatory agencies on both sides of the Atlantic will start a fruitful dialogue on the basis among other things of that data which I trust will be fully available. We will then be in a position to judge how to handle the matter from the point of view of the WTO findings and the American intentions on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to bananas. The Commission decided last week – with the consent of the Council of Ministers – not to appeal on either the substance of the issue or the so‐called systemic question, but we do intend to pursue the latter issue, the systemic issue, in the panel which the EU brought against Section 301 of the US Trade Act. We also intend to pursue it in the dispute settlement understanding review and if necessary in the next trade round.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance of the issue, our intention now is to change our regime in order to comply with the WTO panel ruling. I believe that everybody has agreed that our objective has to be conformity with the WTO. But this will not be easy. We intend to consult extensively with all the main players with the objective of achieving a system which will not be threatened by further WTO challenges. I discussed this issue in Washington two weeks ago with the US agriculture secretary among others. My meetings were followed by discussions at official level. Subsequently, the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for amending the banana regime by the end of May in the light of further contacts with the US and other parties principally concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been clear from these talks that there is no simple way to secure the quick removal of American sanctions. The United States insists that our system should be amended both with regard to licensing and in such a way as to provide what they regard as adequate market access for Latin American bananas. They are willing to support the prolongation of the Lomé waiver when it comes up for renewal next February, but are reluctant about the idea of extending its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">On licences, the Commission sees the possibility of an auctioning tender system as an efficient, transparent and non‐discriminatory method of distributing import licences. While accepting that auctioning was mentioned by the panel as a method consistent with the WTO rules, the Americans have indicated that they continue to have doubts on the legality of such a system.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also had a first discussion with Ecuador, which has indicated its main areas of interest and that it considers that the Community should now compensate it if we do not bring our regime into conformity with the WTO immediately. This week we are also seeing the ACP countries and plan to see the other substantial suppliers too, as soon as possible. When these discussions are concluded we will be better able to judge the parameters for an acceptable solution. We are pursuing a mutually acceptable solution with the US and other interested parties. We are looking at the various suggestions made by the panel established at the request of Ecuador to ensure that we amend our system in a WTO‐compatible way. We are working to reach agreement on a reformed regime with all parties. But if we are unable to do so we will clearly have to propose those changes which we ourselves believe will make our regime compatible with the WTO rules as interpreted in the latest rulings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to hush‐kits. The issue of aircraft noise has achieved prominence in recent months following US concern about our proposed regulation. European airports are situated very often close to densely populated areas which means that there is great local concern about noise pollution when it comes to expanding airport capacity. So we proposed last year a regulation designed to reduce aircraft noise, fuel consumption and pollution. From 2002 there will be a cap on the number of old technology aircraft permitted to be used in the European Union, including aircraft equipped with so‐called hush‐kits or noise mufflers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Americans have argued that this is <span class="italic">de facto</span> discriminatory against aircraft originating from the US and that it will cost US industry more than $1 billion since it will no longer be able to sell its aircraft with hush‐kits to countries neighbouring the EU for operation to and from Community airports. They have not been able to explain in detail the basis for their calculation.</p>
<p class="contents">During numerous high‐level meetings with the US, the Commission and Member States representatives have explained that the measure is non‐discriminatory, that its economic impact is limited and that it merely involves a freeze on the number of noisy aircraft within the Community. We have also argued that the current ICAO noise certification standard has not been updated since 1977, largely due to American reluctance.</p>
<p class="contents">Following intensive discussions over the past few weeks we now seem to have found a way of defusing this issue. Last week the Council adopted the proposed regulation regarding aircraft noise but also decided, taking due account of the views of Parliament, to delay its application for one year. This delay will help us to conclude the discussions we started with the Americans in March. These discussions will focus on promoting work within ICAO to reach the next generation of noise restraint standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally the Americans have given priority to working speedily and in close cooperation with the European Union within this framework. These discussions will also address the more immediate or short‐term noise problems. We will consider proposing amendments to our legislation to meet any legitimate US concerns. The Commission is invited to report to the Council on the progress of these discussions by September this year. We will also keep Parliament closely informed, particularly through the relevant committees. We will naturally continue to defend European interests vigorously, but we want to avoid unnecessary and potentially damaging trade disputes with the US. We look to the United States to show similar restraint on other issues where we are seeking to resolve our differences.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mann, Erika </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Commissioner Brittan, once again you have made the position very clear, and indeed you have also dealt with the various trade disputes in which we have been engaged with the United States for quite a number of months, if not for years in some cases. Several points give me cause for some concern. Without further ado, I should like to turn to the first of these. All these cases, these trade disputes, in which we are at present engaged with the United States or with Canada, are in principle test cases, in which the boundaries set by the World Trade Organisation are being scrutinised to see how much independence and autonomy countries actually have to determine their own policies in particular fields, whether it is consumer protection, whether it is health care, whether it is a question of how policies with respect to developing countries can be implemented – as in the banana case – or whether it is about standards. These are all key questions, and we have a World Trade Organisation which has marked out a framework within which we have to act as a trading partner. In principle and by and large we are happy, but we know that there are definite borderline situations and cases which are being tested out by means of complaints or rulings. This is the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is that there are two conflicting models here, and the hormones case illustrates this perfectly: the famous American model, if I may call it that, with a different system of health care, and the European model, in which welfare is given greater prominence.</p>
<p class="contents">What bothers me is how we are going to be able to work together in the future and how in the new trade round we are going to be able on the one hand to agree on more common standards, while on the other hand guaranteeing a greater degree of independence and autonomy in the self‐determination of regions and countries. That will not be very easy; indeed we have already discussed in the committee several times how this is to be achieved. This hormone case will be the test case for the European Union. This will far surpass everything we experienced in the banana dispute, because here consumers will of course be very sensitive, and they want policies which guarantee the highest possible standards of health care and health protection.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, I am very unsure of how we can react in the light of the answer which you have given. On no account should we rule out any option, and on no account – this is my group"s opinion and other colleagues will also be mentioning this – should we make any concessions at this stage. On no account should we make a political statement committing ourselves to anything before we have the final results of the scientific investigations. Only then should we reopen discussions – involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission – on what our next move ought to be. At the present time, I would consider a statement of any kind to be premature.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kittelmann </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of great agitation, whether the source of this is the Kosovo conflict or a different conflict altogether, we are again obliged to debate a subject in the European Parliament which has already occupied all of us for too long, the trade dispute with the USA. The United States is insisting on one point of view, firstly with bananas – an issue which has most likely been resolved in its favour – and now with hormones, where it is extremely difficult to draw the picture in such a way that it will attract the sympathy of those outside the European Union, because the trade disputes we are talking about here only involve 2 % of our joint trade.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is precisely because of this that I should like, on this occasion, to make a clear appeal to the United States. Although we know about the need for innovation, what really matters to us Europeans is not neglecting our traditional roots. I am thinking here, for example, of banana growing in some Member States and protecting our consumers, to whom we are accountable as elected Members, and we need to further consolidate that level of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so, we also take the liberty of setting different priorities from those of our American colleagues in Congress. However, I do think it is essential also to appeal to the Commission and the Council. Sir Leon, our experience of working with you over the last few years has been extremely positive, because during the transatlantic trade disputes you have worked very closely with the European Parliament. I should like to thank you very much for that, but you alone are not the Commission and the Council. I should therefore, on behalf of my group, also like to ask that any efforts to resolve the trade disputes by extending the procedure before the WTO, so as to delay the result, should be vigorously opposed. I must remind all of us of what we have done frequently in the past. The European Union and the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia each have one vote in the WTO, but hundreds of developing countries, who are waiting in the WTO and hoping that their interests will also be taken into consideration, must not be sidelined by ongoing disputes between the European Union and the USA, because there are other fundamental problems too.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask that we Europeans do not only think about playing for time in order to delay the process of rectifying the underlying injustices. As the general rapporteur of the European Parliament, I should also like to warn that behaviour of this kind – playing with WTO rules mainly for political motives – might weaken the standing of the WTO both in the eyes of the USA and in the eyes of our own voters.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to call on the Socialist Group to support the PPE Group"s line on this issue. We are all experiencing all kinds of political difficulties as a result of the banana ruling and the hormone case. Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties, we should not lose sight of the essential features of the legal solution, which is actually a workable one. The WTO banana ruling requires us to produce a clear regime for our own producers and ACP producers, as far as providing adequate market access for all third countries is concerned. I would also plead for a solution to be found as quickly as possible, because the legitimate imposition of punitive tariffs by the USA has put other sectors of the economy under considerable pressure and jobs are at risk in Europe as a result. As regards assessing and authorising hormone‐treated beef from the USA, I would ask you to bear in mind that the reason we set up a multilateral legal framework was precisely to protect weaker states. Thanks to the WTO and because we are not giving in to market power, we have a legal procedure for raising legitimate concerns. But if no hard scientific evidence can be produced, then obviously no import ban can be imposed. The first in a series of reports assessing the health risks of hormone‐treated meat has, however, come out today. The first point to emerge from this is that it is not completely safe to consume this meat. But we should avoid having a transatlantic – or indeed a European – philosophical war about individual reports and should wait calmly for the final verdict of the scientific community. It is noticeable that comments made in the interim are based more on emotion than on the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have tried to combine the various opinions held in the European Parliament in one joint motion, to allow Europe to speak with one voice on this important matter. I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of this motion for a resolution.</p>

I agree with what the Commissioner said about the consequences to be drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Far more problematic is the question of animal hormones. In the first place, I think it has to be absolutely certain that there is no threat to human health. The second point I would raise is that of consideration for animals. Can these hormones be fed to animals without doing them harm? I think European views on this are very different from those in the United States, and this too is something we must raise in the forthcoming talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question I would ask of the Commissioner is this: what happens if we permit US meat containing hormones, provided it is labelled? Can we then legitimately forbid European producers to use animal hormones? What will the upshot of that be?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Parliament has made numerous pronouncements already on the whole question of policy regarding the quality of farm products. Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution last October which broadly sets out what a policy of quality for European farm products might comprise. I suggest that this be taken into consideration in future discussions.</p>

The first is the need to foster dialogue with the Americans, as well as with other regions of the world, because we need now, and will need in the future, to form new alliances. The second is the need for greater vigilance on the part of the European Union in the WTO negotiations, bearing in mind their growing importance. This is of course a collective problem that also involves the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, in the banana affair, which you dealt with so well, the European Union must pursue its action against unilateral legislation before the WTO. With regard to hormone‐treated beef, there are fundamental issues at stake, such as food safety and the choice of agricultural model. The interim report and the concerns voiced in the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue considerably consolidate our position on the matter and, as Erika Mann mentioned, it is important not to make any concessions at this stage. If there is any compensation, it must be of a temporary nature. And as regards labelling, any change in approach would, at present, seriously weaken our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, Commissioner, bearing in mind the problems posed by the old WTO agreements on these types of products, I should like to know if you would consider reopening the WTO file on two counts. First, we need a better definition of the precautionary principle with, in particular, a reversal of the need to furnish proof where doubts arise. Second, we need a better definition of expertise, because the Codex Alimentarius cannot be considered to be an unequivocal legitimate reference.</p>

With all due respect, Sir Leon, we have to discuss this now, and when you say that there is no reason for consumers to panic because we have the ban, then I have to say that we are on the brink of lifting the ban and, as Mrs Mann said, this is undoubtedly about the different ways of life in America and Europe. However, it is also about the huge interests of hormone producers and users here in Europe, Mr Kittelmann, as is apparent from your speech and the softly‐softly manner in which it was made. In fact, we now have exactly what you wanted: no emotion, but the scientific proof – and, as requested, this is qualitative not quantitative – that the use of hormones is harmful, that they pose a risk to health, that they are carcinogenic and that they cause puberty to begin prematurely in girls; I am just translating what it says here. This is what we have repeatedly stated and pointed out in the past: the use of sex hormones disturbs the hormonal balance in children at this particularly sensitive time.</p>
<p class="contents">Sir Leon, consumer protection must take priority here, and this is not a legal issue; the legal issue should take second place to consumer protection and preventing the public from harm. Neither, Mr Mulder, is it about not complying with WTO rules and negotiated agreements. We want very much to comply with them, but we need to have some input into them and we need to develop them further where dispute settlement is concerned, as well as in the social and environmental fields and in the fields of health and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Sir Leon, we have seen that when dubious substances of this kind are used, the floodgates are opened, including for illegal use. In fact we can see it now with the samples which the Commission has taken that banned hormones are being used in the USA, and that it is not true that the meat which comes here is hormone‐free. That means that if we were to lift this hormone ban, we would have to authorise the use of hormones here, with all their adverse consequences. Side‐effects might be acceptable where medicines are concerned, Sir Leon, but with food there should be no such side‐effects, and here the burden of proof needs to be reversed so that those who wish to produce and use these substances have to prove that they are harmless. That is what we should say in the WTO negotiations, and we should raise the issue of our European way of life and ensure that we are able to keep it.</p>

This is part of the American philosophy of taking the offensive, to which it would be a good idea to respond, using the same instruments of course, but we cannot continue to ignore the price being paid as a result by some economic sectors and I would also point out, Sir Leon, by some countries more than others. I have never been an ardent nationalist but there is no doubt that if we look at the statistics – and you must know them better than we do – we can see that Italy and some of Italy"s economic sectors have been hardest hit by the punitive duties imposed as part of the American retaliation. For example, the battery and accumulator industry is incurring extremely heavy losses, amounting to millions and millions of dollars, as a result of the 100 % duty rates imposed under the terms of this war.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we would therefore make, and I know that this is being studied by DG I, is to set up a compensation fund, to propose to the budget authority that in order to give you and our common trade policy some weapons with which to fight, it should put into the budget a fund, a reserve which could provide compensation for European businesses that are the innocent victims of this fair and necessary common trade policy. This is the suggestion which I should like the House to approve, but at the same time I would like to support the studies you are carrying out with a view to making a practical proposal, so that the new financial perspective and the new budget also contain a pm entry, a specific reference to this extra weapon for our common trade policy.</p>

Your speech surprised me; no, actually it did not surprise me. But in fact it did surprise me, because there are only two explanations for it. Either you cannot read, or you had a preconceived opinion and wanted this opinion to be confirmed, and that is why you do not like the scientific reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider where we stand today. You said that it was a legal and economic issue. Is it a legal issue? The WTO Appellate Body has told us to prove that there is a health risk. Has it not been proven? The danger is proven, so where does that leave us today? Mrs Mann said that we were not actually sure how we should react, and Mr Kittelmann said that any action we took had to be legal and actually workable. Mr Kittelmann, I look forward with great interest to seeing how you explain to your voters at the elections to the parliament in Berlin what is legal and actually workable. It was 20 years ago, Sir Leon, when colleagues of yours did this in your country, the United Kingdom, and look where that got us with BSE. You are well on the way to continuing that process with the government of the United Kingdom, should you believe that you have their support.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just consider where we are. We have six hormones. The scientific reports say that all of them pose a risk to health and that one of them both causes cancer and aggravates it, and you dare to say in all seriousness, Sir Leon, that now there should be greater transparency. Is that what you have in your Directorate‐General and in your private office? I would love to know. There should be greater transparency, we need new analyses: which ones then? Ones which support and match what you actually want? And you say that we need new scientific data. Which data would that be, Sir Leon? I know that really you were in favour of the labelling option. Anyone who can read, see and hear knows that. But you also know what the labelling option means. A piece of meat can perhaps be labelled, but nothing which derives from it can be, not minced meat and nothing, nothing, nothing more! You, the Commission, repeatedly told us this, did you not, when we were in favour of comprehensive labelling and wanted that in Parliament. Anyone who is in favour of labelling now is saying loud and clear: we actually accept health risks, we do not take any notice of them, and we accept that people will be at risk, including children who have not reached puberty – Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf made that point. Mr Kittelmann, go out onto the streets in Berlin and say: ‘but it does say on the label that it is highly dangerous for children during puberty and for everyone else as well; and if people already have cancer it encourages more tumours to form, and in addition it can be carcinogenic". Go on, why not? I could not hope for more in the election campaign!</p>
<p class="contents">Now just tell me one thing, Sir Leon. You will not be in office for much longer, and that is why I do not actually need to hold too intensive a discussion with you. Whom are you actually representing here? Are you representing the USA, or are you representing the European Union? If so, whom in the European Union? Certainly not consumers, because if so you would be aware that one of the basic principles of European Union legislation is that only safe, completely harmless products are allowed onto the market, and even then they are labelled. You see, a label is not a warning notice, Sir Leon; a label provides consumers with information, but the assumption is that the products are safe. That is not the case here, and what you are doing at the moment is what I would normally describe as reckless, but it is irresponsible, and I will make it clear in public what the Christian Democrats here in this House stand for!</p>

What does not seem as logical is that yet again the textile sector – among many others – is suffering the consequences of a crisis that has nothing to do with it. Indeed, following the decision by the WTO arbitration body, export tariffs for this sector will be increased by 100 %. Cotton bed linen and cashmere goods are particularly badly hit, as are other sectors, specifically those on the list that accompanies the World Trade Organisations"s ruling. For the companies involved, the consequences will be very serious indeed. As you are aware, Commissioner, the textile sector is going through a particularly difficult time as it is being forced to compete with massive imports of cheap goods from Turkey and Asia. As a result, its plight is causing great concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, not all the Member States of the European Union are affected by the measures mentioned. This constitutes a serious distortion of the rules of competition within the single market and it will lead to even further negative consequences for those companies affected by the high tariffs the United States is imposing in its sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, for these sectors which are now the victims of the banana war, it is essential to settle the dispute as soon as possible. I have therefore been very encouraged by what you said, and by the details of the initiatives and actions you mentioned that are aimed at finding a solution at the earliest opportunity. In addition, I am in favour of setting up a compensation fund to assist companies affected by the sanctions. Without assistance, many of these companies will soon be in a critical situation and could even fold. The resulting job losses would be particularly unfortunate at a time when the Union is trying to promote policies designed to increase employment opportunities.</p>

This means that we cannot simply decide anything we like. It also means that consumers expect food to be of decent quality, but above all, consumers expect and demand that food should not be damaging to health. The situation may not be all that good here, but it is still better than in many other places. What we are seeing today is a dispute between two continents. As has already been said, this dispute concerns, amongst other things, meat treated with hormones, and in this case it is quite clear, as has been emphasised here, that we should put consumer interests first. Labelling is not an option at all, because it is not the job of consumers to act as guinea pigs for industry's new ideas. You must not gamble with people's health. I therefore also regret the fact that labelling is one of the options the Commission has mentioned in its statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that it is very difficult to turn the WTO into the champion of consumer interests. But it is also true that faith in free trade has proved to be misguided. There is no reason to expect free trade to solve every problem. Free trade cannot be the driving force for the environment and consumer interests, quite simply because the two areas require a political consideration which the market cannot give. We therefore need to get some more politics into the WTO. And the EU will be among those insisting on the right to defend public health against the free market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term we will also have to require the Commission, when negotiating these WTO agreements, to put consumer interests and environmental considerations before concern for the sacred free market. You need to understand that in the Commission. It is not good enough to consider only the free market, because then consumers lose out, as we have seen in this case. Things cannot be left to the market alone.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Madam President, I will do my best. Let me begin with the banana issue, which is of great importance to a number of people. I listened with great interest to what was said, for example by Mr Dell'Alba and Mrs Ferrer. We are trying to resolve the question by coming up, after consultation with all the people who have a legitimate interest in it, with proposals, which we hope will be acceptable to all, to deal with the problem by amending our regime. If that happens, by definition the sanctions will end and that is the quickest way of getting them to end. But people cannot be forced to reach agreement and, therefore, we have to envisage the possibility of not reaching a comprehensive agreement. We then have to do our best, after having heard what everybody has to say, to make changes which meet the rules and satisfy as many people as possible, if not everybody. That of course we can do. But in those circumstances we will be able to say to the United States that the sanctions are not justified. The only way of compelling the United States to remove the sanctions is through the WTO and, therefore, I can assure Mr Herzog that we will continue with the 301 case in the WTO as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the question of compensation, there are considerable difficulties as to whether it is possible to give it and there are certain disadvantages which, if mentioned, would only give aid and succour to our opponents on this issue. I would not wish to do that publicly but I can well understand the deep concern. This morning in Brussels, before coming here, I held a meeting with representatives of the European textile industry and I understand exactly how serious the situation is for them and for other people who are at the receiving end. Therefore, we will continue very hard and are committed to putting four proposals to the Council by the end of the month, with agreement or in the absence of agreement from our trading partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to hormones. I must admit that I thought Mrs Roth‐Behrendt got the wrong end of the stick in her comments as far as I was concerned, as well as what she said about Mr Kittelmann, which was without justification. As far as I am concerned, there is no question at all, as her tone if not her words suggested, of ignoring the interests of the consumer or wishing to put people's health at risk. I fear that her interpretation to the contrary bore a whiff of the electoral campaign rather than the exercise of pure reason, because the point I made was a very simple one: as long as the ban exists, there can be no risk to health because meat with hormones is not allowed into the European Union. As nobody at the moment has a proposal to lift the ban – you certainly did not hear any such proposal from me. There is absolutely nothing more which anybody can do to protect European health than to stop something coming in. You cannot do more than that; you cannot have a double ban. So what are now faced with is how best to handle the situation we have as a result of these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I should like to comment on some of the broader questions which Mrs Mann and Mr Kittelmann raised. We have to ask ourselves: is there a fundamental conflict, as Mr Iversen seemed to suggest, between trade and consumer protection? The answer is no! It is absolutely clear that the WTO rules permit you to ban dangerous products. They do not permit you to ban products because you say they are dangerous, you must have a reason. It goes further than that: you do not have to be able to prove that the products are dangerous, you must have respectable evidence, even if it does not necessarily represent the majority or dominant view of the scientific community.</p>
<p class="contents">When the WTO looked at our hormone ban – which of course existed long before the WTO came into existence – it came to the conclusion that the process by which we had arrived at that ban was not a risk assessment which met the standards that could reasonably be asked for before a ban was put in place. It is exactly for that reason that we have begun a new risk assessment, and we have the interim results of it, which, as I understand it, are partly derived from the re‐examination of published literature on the basis of the criteria set out by the appellate body and partly derived from the interim conclusions of some of the seventeen new studies we have commissioned. It is an interim report: the final report comes at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have to ask ourselves is: how do we handle this situation as far as the WTO is concerned? It is no use saying that we have our report and that proves it, because it does not remove the threat of sanctions. You have heard the people from the countries affected by the banana sanctions. I can tell you that the possibility of sanctions from the United States on this is much more serious, and therefore it is acting very much in the interests of European consumers, European individuals and European employment to say that it is sensible that these findings should be put into the public domain as fully as possible. It has not happened yet. I hope it will happen more fully very soon. There should be serious discussion amongst scientists on both sides of the Atlantic, because I do not believe that the United States is careless about the health of its citizens: it is as yet unpersuaded that there is a risk and, if we have evidence, it is right to put it to the United States as well as to everybody else.</p>
<p class="contents">The question then is: at what point do we do this and how do we handle it? That is something which bears further consideration. There is no fundamental conflict between consumer protection and trade. The WTO as it stands allows for that balance in a proper way. I am not saying that it is perfect – I would not say that to Mrs Mann and Mr Kittelmann at all. We have to consider exactly in the coming trade round how to improve the rules and make them clearer. I agree with Mr Herzog that one of the things we have to do is to produce a better definition of what the precautionary principle really means. I hope that it is possible for Parliament then to consider these issues on the basis of what has happened, knowing that there is no question of any precipitate action which could conceivably endanger the health of the European citizen.</p>
