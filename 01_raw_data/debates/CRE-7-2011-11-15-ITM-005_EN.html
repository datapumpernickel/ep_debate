<p class="contents">In 2010, 116 million people were at risk of poverty, more than 20% of our fellow citizens; 8% of Europeans were experiencing severe material deprivation; and these numbers must be greater today with the crises that we are currently going through.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the 2020 strategy adopted here set itself the objective of reducing the number of poor to 20 million and this platform aims to provide a tool in combating this problem, which, in itself, is a violation of basic human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole thrust of this report, in addition to outlining how it is to operate, is primarily to give the European Union and the Member States a road map with recommendations for policies which can be implemented to achieve this objective. The fact that it has been adopted by this Parliament takes on a particular significance in current political and economic circumstances. It is essential for people to see that the Union is not only concerned about Member States’ debts, but also about their economic and social circumstances and that there are still institutions and MEPs who are promoting a sense of solidarity between the Member States and their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also contains a statement relating to current circumstances and the food aid programme for the most deprived which we would like to see maintained at 500 million in both the short and the long term. Yesterday, the Council of agriculture ministers reached an agreement to do this, at least in the short term. That is good. At last, we have a positive signal on this matter. That was the least we could expect, but what concerns me is the reluctance, and even the threats made by certain Member States against the Union’s social policies before we got to that point. The long-term problem has not even been resolved yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise some more basic points covered in this report. Firstly, certain categories of people who are more vulnerable to the risk of poverty, such as children, women, the elderly, the disabled, migrants and the Roma, need individual treatment and therefore each group is covered separately in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, a variety of factors can lead to poverty. They, too, are subject to specific recommendations. That is the case, for example, of the lack of decent and accessible housing, of decent jobs, of high-quality, accessible and non-discriminatory social services, of education systems that reduce the early school leaving rate and professional training that is tailored to the jobs market. It is also the case, quite simply, of financial resources to meet basic needs and, consequently, a minimum income in Europe within a Community legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement such policies at European level, we are, of course, calling for the Commission to mobilise European funds to finance poverty-eradication initiatives, especially the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be palpably obvious that, at European and national levels, we cannot carry out public policy without adequate funding. We must have investment in social affairs if we are to eradicate poverty and stimulate the growth that will create jobs and set us on a virtuous circle.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to emphasise one point: austerity measures within the framework of European economic governance cannot be allowed to endanger employment or social protection. Just keeping an eye on inflation rates, deficits and debts is not enough. Member States must also be accountable for trends in poverty and Parliament must receive regular reports on this. The report therefore stresses the need within the platform for regular monitoring of progress made by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">All these recommendations were broadly the subject of discussions at the first convention of the European platform against poverty and social exclusion in Kraków and were quite favourably received by the actors on the ground in the fight against poverty. It is crucial for them to be involved, as the report recommends.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on my fellow Members to lend massive support to this report, as was the case in the Committee, so that Parliament is finally able to send a positive signal to its citizens at a time when they are feeling under pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Frédéric Daerden, and the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs, for the comprehensive report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion. The report is very timely in the current context of a severe economic and financial downturn across the European Union and the consequent impact this has on vulnerable groups in societies.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, let me recall that the first annual convention of the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, jointly organised by the Commission and the Polish Presidency, took place in Kraków. This convention brought together over 400 participants from 38 European countries, including Ministers and State Secretaries, other policy makers, civil society representatives, journalists, people experiencing poverty and independent experts. I was very pleased that Members of the European Parliament, including Mr Daerden himself, today’s rapporteur, attended the convention. I represented the Commission there, and I think the first meeting of this convention was successful, useful and forward-looking.</p>
<p class="contents">The convention took stock of the implementation of the poverty platform and it discussed how the different policy areas – employment, education, health, just to mention a few – could contribute to tackling poverty and social exclusion. This multidimensional approach, which was welcomed by all participants, should be further strengthened in the future in line with the European Platform; employment, education, and health, together with housing, are the key parameters in the European framework of Roma integration strategies, which is a major anti-poverty effort that requires European-level coordination but also support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daerden, in your report, you underlined the multidimensional aspects of poverty, ranging from extreme poverty and homelessness to in-work poverty, but also the gender and age dimensions, and the specific questions of people with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The European platform against poverty and social exclusion alone will not be able to solve all the issues raised in the report, but it provides, in my view, a good framework for actions, and each and every one should accept their share of responsibility in tackling the rising problem of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the actions to be implemented and solutions, you mentioned that there is a need for a better monitoring system allowing rapid and accurate analysis. I agree with you. We have already started to develop such a system with the involvement of Eurostat and the indicators subgroup of the Social Protection Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">You also called for regular and critical monitoring of the Member States’ poverty-reduction targets. This is indeed very important. The current national targets will not allow the EU headline target to be met. Pressure is also needed from Parliament to ensure a higher level of ambition across the Member States which, at a later stage, can be translated into higher national targets. While the economic crisis is placing a huge pressure on national social protection systems, it cannot be an alibi for non-action. More fairness in fiscal consolidation can be applied and must be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you on tackling child poverty urgently and giving all children the possibility of fulfilling their potential, regardless of their social background. In 2012, therefore, I intend to propose common principles on child poverty covering support for families, access to essential services and participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentally, more and better employment is the most effective route out of poverty. However, the current economic situation is not conducive to employment growth and many groups, especially young people, have difficulties in entering, or staying in, the labour market. Against this background, the Commission will soon launch the Youth Opportunities Initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond conventional employment policy, the social economy offers opportunities. The Commission adopted Communications on a Social Business Initiative and on Corporate Social Responsibility on 25 October 2011, and I am sure we can do more in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to promote the implementation of the three pillars of active inclusion: namely, active labour market policies, minimum income and access to services. The Commission will present in 2012 an assessment of the implementation of active inclusion strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the budget issues which Mr Daerden raised in the report, the Commission’s proposal envisages allocating at least 20% of the future European Social Fund to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. We have proposed increasing the budget for the ESF by at least 7.5%, which represents a minimum of EUR 84 billion, or 25%, of cohesion policy over the seven years from 2014 to 2020. If adopted, this would imply a very significant increase, both in absolute and relative terms, in the support aimed at the most vulnerable groups in society.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, as regards individual states, we should utilise the European Semester to monitor year after year, in practical terms, the policies they dedicate to this fundamental challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to give credibility to the objective to reduce poverty and social exclusion for around 20 million European citizens, it is necessary to have coherence between the enormous resources that Europe and the States should make available and the concrete policies that we can put into practice. It is calculated that around EUR 2 billion are needed between now and 2020 in order to realise the objectives that we are proposing. The challenge that we as the Committee on Budgets are identifying and focusing on is this: coherence between the financial resources that we make available and the policies that we put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Youth on the Move initiative, for example, is an important tool in the fight against poverty, helping to promote mobility for all pupils, interns and students, and to promote the recognition of professional skills acquired both formally and informally. Either way, this is an enormous challenge and an enormous problem for society, and it was exacerbated by the global crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to call on Member States to create the most effective strategies possible to combat poverty and social exclusion, and to ensure high-quality education and vocational training that is accessible to all, and to carry out more concrete investments in national reform plans. Measures aimed at cultural and linguistic integration into the host country are particularly important for overcoming social exclusion. Despite overall cost-cutting in Europe, we must not forget solidarity or the target of a reduction in the number of people living in poverty of 20 million by 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is vital to create a new social, employment and economic framework that will ensure the basic needs of our population.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 80 million people live below the poverty line, of whom more than half are women and 20 million are children.</p>
<p class="contents">The platform that is the subject of this report could help to achieve greater social justice in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It calls for priority to be placed on education and youth policies as a key element around which to build a fairer and more just society; for an overhaul of the insecure employment contracts that have proliferated in many Member States, undermining protection of the weakest groups in society; for the recognition of the rights of women living in rural areas, whose work is not valued and who are excluded from the basic rights enjoyed by all workers; and for an improvement in national home care programmes for the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">The austerity measures that are so badly needed at this time of crisis must not be incompatible with maintaining basic social services.</p>
<p class="contents">Some 116 million people are threatened by poverty in the European Union, and 42 million live in conditions of severe material deprivation. We must ensure these people’s social protection and create a more prosperous environment that will help to reduce these figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say how pleased I am with the Council’s decision, following several months of stalled negotiations, to release food aid for the poorest members of society.

I would also particularly like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Daerden, who has produced a wonderful report that I hope will be read and, above all, put to use by the European Union institutions and Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with Mr Daerden on the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this serious problem. We agree on the diagnosis because it is clear that we have a serious problem. It is not just that millions of people are affected by poverty or the risk of poverty in Europe, but also the fact that we as Europeans and the entire European project are threatened by this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">If the dignity of a policy, country or region can be measured by the dignity with which we treat the weakest among us, then it is clear we have a serious problem in Europe, and it is clear that the European Union project still has some unresolved matters to address.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem we are up against is not a natural disaster and neither is it unavoidable. We are not facing a biblical curse. We are facing a problem that has its roots in bad policies and is not the responsibility of its victims, as is sometimes said.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had poor social policies, which make it impossible to deal with the effects, and, above all, poor policies implemented by those who stop us from tackling the causes of poverty. We have also had bad economic policies, stupid economic policies that destroy jobs, economic activity, wealth creation and high-quality employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The prognosis is fairly bad too. We are not coping well with the crisis, and this is generating even more poverty because we have had three years of the wrong policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards treatment, we should follow Mr Daerden’s recommendations. There are important programmes in the areas of education, culture, social services and employment, but, above all, Commissioner, Article 9 of the Treaty on European Union must be complied with! We need a social impact study of all EU policies so that we can see and measure their impact in the fight against poverty. We need basic, EU-wide social regulations on social services and minimum income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must be aware that those who are at risk of social exclusion and poverty have to be protected. I know that it is difficult at the moment for Member States to set priorities, but I hope that when they do, they bear in mind those who are homeless and at risk of poverty and social exclusion in many different ways, whether they are older people, disabled people, young people, children or families.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the European platform against poverty and social exclusion on the work they have been doing to highlight the problem. While combating poverty is, of course, mainly the role of Member States, the platform helps to coordinate policy for exchange of best practice. We must also build on the lessons of last year’s European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and boost the involvement of civil society, in particular, NGOs and people living in poverty themselves, whether at European, national, regional or local level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also play a coordinating role. I am not calling for new legislation at EU level. I do not think that is the right way forward. My group, in particular, do not want to see EU legislation on minimum income or on social services of general interest. I am sorry that these have been included in the report, and I have asked for separate votes on these. Having said that, I am a passionate supporter of minimum income schemes brought in by Member States at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need national statistics on poverty to be improved.

<p class="contents">First, a small preliminary point. I would like to remind this House that if we want to combat poverty, there is no use trying the employability approach. In other words, nowadays, work is no longer a true protection against poverty. There are millions of poor people in work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight three particular points which I think are vital if we want to make progress with realistic objectives in the fight against poverty within the EU 2020 strategy. Firstly, the call for a legislative proposal on schemes for a minimum income equal to 60% of the average income in each Member State, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our Parliament one year ago. I think that, as the crisis has worsened, we have become aware that such a measure is essential for our poorest citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the call for a framework directive targeted at guaranteeing the quality of, and especially accessibility to, all social services of general interest, particularly in health, education, public transport, energy and water.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are re-drafting a call to Member States to adopt at the earliest opportunity the proposal for a wide-ranging, anti-discrimination proposal. I welcome these latter two points which seem to me of utmost importance. We are calling for the implementation of a genuine European strategy to help the homeless. The Commission and the Member States can no longer turn a deaf ear to the issue of poor housing in Europe. A genuine solution must be found to these problems today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that we have reached a final agreement on negotiations over food aid, but we should not forget that we must now start thinking about the period after 2013, or more generally about earmarking substantial sums from the cohesion policy budget for the fight against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to encourage the participation, thanks to this report, of all civil society in the introduction of the platform, because we can only speak for the poor if we do so with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? Because the time for naive and hopeless words has passed, and this is the time to take some action. The root cause of poverty is unemployment. If you want to work, it is our job to provide you with the economic conditions for growth: pure and simple. Tinkering around the edges will not help. It will not help to make sweeping statements about Member States’ welfare systems; it will not help to encroach on Member States’ subsidiarity with regard to minimum wage; it will not help to call for an extension of social protection rights to non-EU citizens; and it will not help for the European Commission to take on the role of dishing out country-specific action plans. Since when did micro-management by Brussels ever help anyone or anything?</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody denies that poverty is a real and pressing problem, but poverty is not to do with human rights – it is to do with lack of opportunity and lack of incentive to work productively. It is time that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and this plenary got down to their real work: that is, helping Member States grow their economies and reduce their appalling increasing rates of unemployment, particularly for our young people. This motion not only interferes with matters that should be tackled at national level – and they are being tackled in many Member States – but it puts forward proposals which would actually make nations poorer and less able to deal with the problem. I urge people to think again and vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is nothing short of scandalous in a European Union where big business and the financial sector continue to make large profits.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore condemn so-called austerity policies and programmes, and insist on the need to change profoundly EU economic, financial and social policy, which is the root of current poverty; in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact, the Euro Plus Pact, financial deregulation, and the liberalisation and privatisation of essential public services.</p>
<p class="contents">As argued in the draft amendments that we have tabled, we demand the rejection of such pacts and call for their replacement with a social progress and development pact that prioritises jobs with rights, social inclusion, poverty eradication and the promotion of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the Commission and the Council stop pressurising the Member States to privatise and liberalise public property, public goods and services, and social protection systems. There can be no effective European strategy for combating poverty without a decisive commitment to support for production, for creating jobs with rights, for promoting universal public services, and for a fair share of income and wealth, not least through minimum incomes, pensions and wages equivalent to at least 60% of each Member State’s median income.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for the proposals that we tabled during this plenary sitting to be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every year, we have hundreds of thousands of immigrants, if not more, arriving from outside the European Union. Right from the outset, a lot of these people go straight into the social security system of the Member State where they have settled. People with no job prospects, people without a chance of integration, people who are, from the start, significantly disadvantaged in terms of their language skills.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important that Member States change course and pursue a policy of dissuasion towards potential immigrants who come to Europe and who have no prospect of finding work or becoming integrated. This large-scale importation of poverty should be stopped as soon as possible, because the absorption capacity of the Member States has been more than exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are debating now rightly highlights the problem of many immigrants from outside the EU ending up in poverty. However, in order to address this problem, it is important that we pursue a restrictive immigration policy and, also, that we find other ways to invest in the countries of origin of these immigrants, so that we can stop wasting money and use it to create jobs there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the current crisis, our political actions must be more transparent and there must be greater mobilisation, as we cannot leave it up to associations and NGOs to tackle this problem by themselves. We must mobilise our forces and there is no doubt that we shall have to be more effective. That is what we expect.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point that I would like to make today – and I am very pleased to be able to do so – is that the food aid programme for the most deprived persons puts us in a good position for the 2012 and 2013 campaigns. Rest assured, Commissioner, we shall be fully mobilised over the stability of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to press is that we must do all we can to combat the problem of young people leaving education with no qualifications. If we allow them to leave education with no qualifications, we will certainly stop them from integrating into society and allow them to sink into poverty. In my view, social integration is both a matter of integrating people into the labour market and of training.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the European Social Fund is crucial in this respect. As rapporteur for this very European Social Fund, I shall do my utmost to help it play its role in combating poverty.

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you fought and managed to get the objective of combating poverty included in the Europe 2020 strategy. Our current fear is that, with austerity plans, this essential objective may be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of the agreement on the European food aid programme has left a nasty taste in my mouth as I fear that France and Germany have signed up to abandoning it definitively after 2014. That is not the thrust of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have a sovereign debt crisis and yet nothing should make us deviate from this strategy, as it is our road map, the one that we set for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight against poverty, we must, in the platform that you have introduced, work on more precise indicators, as we still lack the ability to intervene in a targeted fashion with quantified objectives. This would allow us to benefit from intervention from the European Social Fund, in particular, targeted precisely at real trends in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we would like the issue of minimum income to be raised clearly. We are calling for a consultation by the European Commission on a legal proposal of this nature. That, Commissioner, is your responsibility. We are also calling for the issue of accessibility to social services of general interest to be maintained.</p>

This report deals with the reality of life for many citizens, and indeed this is the response from Parliament and it provides a coordinated road map for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the core aspects of this report is that we have equal rights and equal social protection for all workers. I fully support the initiatives on strengthening the social economy and the idea of a sensible minimum income, and also the implementation of the Anti-discrimination Directive. But I also agree with the sentiments of the rapporteur this morning when he says that dealing with debt and implementing austerity measures should not hit those who are already at risk of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few weeks, EU citizens will have listened to Angela Merkel, and others, when she says that Europe is perhaps facing the toughest crisis since the Second World War. She may be right, and her solution to this particular problem is to call for closer political ties and tighter budget rules. In purely economic terms, this may indeed be a possible solution and it might help to balance the books, but the reality for the 80 million people in the EU who are at risk of poverty is that balancing the books on its own is a totally inadequate response. It is no longer sufficient to say we will repair the workings of the current system, plug the holes and carry on as before. If our leaders want the support of their citizens for a new Europe – and they will need that support – they need to implement much of what is in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As my colleague, Ms Harkin, has just been saying, what we are seeing at the moment is a disconnect between macro-economic policy and the effect that it actually has on people’s lives on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to respond to one or two points made by other colleagues this morning – it is a pity they are not still here. The bailouts are not charity. They are about solidarity, and they come with interest rates attached. The ESF itself is about solidarity, and that is why many of us in this House would like to see an increase in the monies going to other countries to help them combat poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the root causes of poverty, I for one do not believe that it is about a lack of opportunity. In some Member States where, for example, every job vacancy is being pursued by at least five unemployed people – before you even begin to look at skills mismatches and geographical mismatches – I think it is a little bit difficult to say that we are going to cut the benefits of people who have not found a job when those jobs are not there.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment in social protection, as this report makes very clear, makes sound economic sense. It is an economic stabiliser; it helps recovery; it reduces future costs where we have to pick up the pieces of people whose health has deteriorated and whose educational opportunities have been lost; and it keeps the local economy moving.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also want to see a reduction in the gap between rich and poor. That is what the ‘Occupy’ movement is about – the power of the 1% as against the other 99% – and that is why issues about a living wage and adequate income are essential in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not sure whether a platform such as the one proposed will help. I nonetheless believe that we should view the economic outlook, if at all possible, in terms of increasing poverty and greater social exclusion. This is unquestionably the result of reduced competitiveness through rigid employment legislation, high taxes on employment and an over generous social system, which de-motivates employers from offering jobs and de-motivates workers from seeking jobs. Policy must create space for people to be able to grow richer on the basis of their own abilities and their own decisions. This requires liberalisation of employment law so that, for example, women can work flexible hours for employers, or work part-time, or so that young people can find a job more easily, as their employers will not be taking too big a risk in the event that either the young person or the employer finds later that the employment relationship is unsuitable or not to their liking. The state must present a robust requalification system for people who have not had a good education, while at the same time ensuring that parents see to it that their children go to school. This applies particularly to the poorest people and to those who really need to get an education. In this context, we need to hold a very serious debate on the so-called minimum wage. Most of you here are perhaps in favour of raising the minimum wage threshold, but you can be sure that any form of codification of a high minimum wage level will mean that the most socially vulnerable and least educated people will lose the opportunity to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do we want a union where the glue that binds us together is our conviction that people in the Member States of the European Union should not be forced to live in poverty? Do we believe that we have a joint responsibility for combating poverty and social exclusion? Or are we choosing a union like the one just outlined by the Members from the far-right group in Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, I think that the attitude of the Member States and, in particular, of some of their governments is bringing us dangerously close to the vision of the European Union that has just been formulated by those on the extreme right-wing. This means not doing anything jointly or putting in place any joint instruments or indicators. Wherever possible, the wording is vague. This is made very, very clear in many of the points in the report. I believe that we need to take a much stronger approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to bring an immediate end to the sell-off of public assets and of social security systems. We need minimum social and environmental standards. This winter, we must not allow people to be thrown out on the street, or deported, or ultimately even to freeze to death, because of rising energy prices. We have a joint responsibility in this respect, in other words, the responsibility of the European Union. We must stand up for this and not for the nationalist claptrap that we have heard from those on the right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Within this framework, we have assembled to discuss plans to support Roma communities and to provide accommodation for immigrants. We should think about helping those social categories that truly find themselves in difficulty and providing both financial and political support to the family, which is the institution on which our society is founded. We should help those small and medium-sized enterprises that have been throttled by the crisis, because SMEs are the true antidote to poverty and the true source of wealth in our countries. We should give precedence to our better forces, and not tax them to guarantee immigrants a minimum wage that Europe wants to drop.</p>
<p class="contents">Enough natter about the Roma and on immigrants – we now need to give precedence to the truly excluded. If we look around us closely, we will see many of these – there is certainly no need to go to a Roma camp to see them.

I hope that a common legal basis will contribute to better coordination and increase the effectiveness of actions aimed at fighting poverty and helping the most needy. Especially in the difficult times of a crisis, which most affect the poorest people, who are often without savings or greater prospects, we must focus our attention on those who are most vulnerable. Governments of countries in search of budget savings tend to reduce spending on social assistance, which exacerbates further the situation facing these people.</p>
<p class="contents">In Frédéric Daerden’s report, the proposal to create a basket of basic goods and services that would be available to everyone is particularly relevant. This solution would ensure a necessary minimum for each person and allow for a decent existence. At the same time, such a project must be accompanied by measures aimed at creating jobs, even for the low-skilled, and appropriate policies for social housing.</p>
<p class="contents">The goals that we have set in the Europe 2020 strategy are ambitious, but feasible. If the theory and what we put on paper are followed by action taken by the governments of our Member States in collaboration with civil society organisations, we will be able to reduce the number of people remaining on the margins of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the most serious signs of the decline in living standards is the sharp growth in poverty. Even though I applaud the effort made by the European institutions in the comprehensive fight against poverty and social exclusion, I would like to point out that all of the proposed measures must be funded from somewhere. Economic growth has practically ground to a halt in the Union, and obtaining the money to cover government debt on the financial markets is increasingly hard for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to obtain funds for the payment of social benefits, unemployment benefits, assistance with food or social housing is therefore to attempt another form of redistribution within the current possibilities afforded by local, regional and state budgets. From this standpoint, I also consider the EU’s proposed 2012 budget, which increases the resources for combating poverty by a mere 3.3% compared to last year, to be inadequate, and it also squanders European money on senseless activities such as the House of European History or Parliament’s regular monthly shuttle between Strasbourg and Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They do not have enough money for food, housing and clothing. The European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion in 2010 raised awareness of the situation of the people affected and gave rise to a number of initiatives, including the creation of decent and dignified jobs, the introduction of minimum wage levels, access to affordable health care, campaigns in socially vulnerable regions and integration projects for immigrants. The Member States are primarily responsible for generating a sense of solidarity with the weakest members of our society. However, at a European level, it is all about financing and coordination. The European platform is part of the Europe 2020 strategy and is also one of seven flagship initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The austerity measures taken during the economic crisis, which are necessary to safeguard our future, must not put jobs and social protection at risk. We must go on making efforts to promote basic education, training and integration into the labour market. We are all responsible for ensuring that the poor do not lose out. Therefore, we must continue to take concrete action to put into practice our fundamental values of solidarity and justice, even in difficult times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is why I believe it is very important to consider a phenomenon which is affecting Europe for the first time – that of the working poor.

<p class="contents">However, it should also be a moment of truth for Europe with regard to growing social exclusion, and the need to denounce and resolve it. It is enough to read the Caritas reports and speak to volunteers committed to tackling urban poverty to understand the extent of the phenomenon which now affects even those who never thought they would find themselves in a soup kitchen or a hostel.</p>
<p class="contents">It is enough to look around. A few weeks ago in Paris, in Place de la Bastille, I saw a homeless couple sleeping rough, with a new-born baby between them. There were others in Rue St-Antoine – so we are talking about a wealthy part of Paris – another couple on the ground, on cardboard boxes, with two children under the covers as well. I stopped to look at the reactions of passers-by and, over the course of 15 minutes, no one even stopped to look. The indifference of a large portion of our citizens is another face of this emergency. Last year, I spent a night in Rome with Emmaus volunteers. I learnt a lot, but I also discovered that they were scandalously alone.</p>

Frequently, it results in stigmatisation and discrimination. The criminalisation of the poor can be observed in several countries. The far-right speaks of Gipsy criminality and homeless criminality, and social experts standing up for the poorest can, as seen in Hungary, even end up in the dock if they act according to the ethical code of their profession. When examining national strategies for the reduction of poverty, the Commission must also monitor whether public policies serve that goal, whether the tax system and the system of family benefits reduces social disparities and contributes to the mitigation of child poverty, whether the school system equalises the handicaps children bring with them from home and prevents the passing on of poverty between generations, whether social transfers ensure the right to economic, political, cultural and social participation, and whether universal services are accessible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Poverty is truly a very serious problem, and effective and rapid action is required to halt the increase of this phenomenon, which is currently affecting more than 80 million Europeans. The serious crisis we are experiencing has exacerbated this situation and made life very difficult for us, as Commissioner Andor said. The number of unemployed people continues to rise, and we all know that a lack of jobs is a passport to poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation requires resources, will and a great deal of commitment from the European Commission and the Member States. If that does not happen, the target of pulling 20 million Europeans out of poverty during this decade will not be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore warmly welcome the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, which is a very important instrument for ensuring social justice. However, no one doubts that the best remedies for poverty and social exclusion are the creation of jobs and the promotion of economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This begs the question as to whether the Member States do not want or are unable to set an adequate or at least a minimum wage? I therefore turn to the Commissioner and call for a decision to be adopted as soon as possible on a minimum income for the whole European Union. I also warmly welcome the idea raised in the report that Member States should set adequate minimum pensions so that people who have worked all their lives are not trapped in poverty in old age. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that more often than not, it is women who live in poverty, and here we should adopt a decision as soon as possible on the care and nursing of family members because in such instances, women very often fall into poverty because they are unable to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all need to realise that the social fabric is unravelling and the risk of social disruption in the Union is increasing. The objectives of macro-economic stability may be necessary and painful efforts to achieve fiscal adjustment may be imposed; however, the pledge which all of us made within the framework of the EU 2020 strategy to combat poverty and increase quality employment cannot, and must not, be undermined.</p>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commissioner on his approach, but I tell him that I do not want a Europe which introduces tough sanctions for breaching eurozone rules but none for breaching anti-poverty targets. I do not want a Britain where the Institute of Fiscal Studies says that child poverty – which Labour was committed to eliminating – will rise again to 3 million children; a Britain where 280 000 disabled people are losing support to be able to work and 80 000 disabled people losing welfare benefits which even allow them to leave their homes; or a Britain which yesterday saw confirmation of the closure of 124 Sure Start centres which had been specifically targeted to help poorer families and which we were promised would stay open.</p>

I would like to add one comment to this. Social exclusion has far-reaching implications for the future of democracy, and I believe that we should take this fact into account as well. As regards the report, I have two comments. In 2008, we knew of 80 million people living in poverty, while today we are already talking about 100 million, of whom 20 million are children. It is obvious that the fight against child poverty must take priority, because here the human resources of the future are at stake. What about the others, however? It is also evident that extreme poverty in Europe is unbearable and indeed verges on the violation of human rights. I believe that this, too, should be reflected in our priorities. The other comment I would briefly like to make concerns the monitoring of poverty. After all, even now, we are working with three-year-old data and do not really have information on how the crisis has affected poverty trends. It has probably exacerbated extreme poverty, too. In this respect, I would like to point out that it is not enough to monitor relative poverty only, as there are vast differences between individual countries, and if we were to derive the concept of minimum income from this, we could create major pitfalls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Combating poverty and social exclusion is the responsibility of the Member States, but in the past, the national governments have not been sufficiently ambitious and have taken too few concrete measures. Well-meaning words are not enough. The current austerity policies in Europe, which have resulted in cuts in social budgets, are also creating more poverty in new areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the employment policy guidelines and the Europe 2020 strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. In my opinion, a key factor in this respect is employment, in the form of good jobs. A total of 8% of European employees are classified as working poor and 22% of the people at risk of poverty in Europe have a job. That is a quarter of the population. For this reason, we must begin by introducing fairer labour and social standards and minimum wages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The approach that has been taken, which involves turning the euro area into a transfer union, will soon lead to the net contributors being dragged in.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the requirements of the Maastricht criteria, some Member States are taking responsibility for the debts of others. Unfortunately, this means that we will have to tighten our belts even further with regard to social spending, and not only in Greece and in the crisis countries in southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU obviously did not envisage this happening when it put together one rescue package after another. There are also hardly any concrete measures to be found in the declarations of intent. Families with several children and single parents in particular are often completely neglected by these policies and the poverty of the parents then has an impact on the future prospects of the children. We must finally recognise that bringing up children and caring for other family members are valuable services for society and deserve payment in return.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ease the tax burden by introducing family tax splitting, which means that the larger the number of people in a household, the lower the tax rate. In addition, we must make it easier for parents to return to work and establish lower levels of non-wage labour costs which will encourage employers to hire people who have children.</p>
<p class="contents">Impressive speeches and a year for combating poverty will not solve the real problems. On the contrary, we must take genuine action to eradicate poverty and ensure that the wealthy countries, middle-class families and older people are not dragged down into this maelstrom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This facet of society, too, is very vulnerable. We do not have the time to go into an analysis of the reasons and solutions. I would like to highlight three points. The first is adherence to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is very important and is rightly included in the report. The second point – and before I come to it, I would like to state that the implementation of European Union strategy is important and should be strictly adhered to – is the Europe 2020 strategy. I consider both of these important in this respect. The third point, because there is another issue that severely impacts people with disabilities, is the matter of accessibility. Without physical and communicational accessibility, there can be no solution for these people. This is a very important question in the European Union, and should be resolved as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should strive to ensure that public services such as education, communication and health services are available equally to all citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw attention to two problems which concern me very much. The first problem is the decision to reduce, and consequently eliminate, the food aid to those most in need. In Poland, around 4 million individuals benefit from this programme. There are 20 000 volunteers and 7 000 organisations working for this programme and for the people who need it. Today, we have heard many beautiful words and declarations while, at the same time, the European Commission and the Council have decided to liquidate the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to the problem of discarded food. In the European Union today, we discard millions of tonnes of food, and billions of euro are thrown away as waste food sent for recycling waste. I would like to add my voice in support of programmes which aim to educate the citizens of the European Union in order to reduce the amount of food which is thrown away or recycled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I emphasise the need to support the European food distribution scheme to the most deprived people in the EU, in particular, for women who are often the first victims of food poverty. Of fundamental importance is the call to Member States to guarantee adequate support to single-parent families that are at high risk of poverty; this should be not simply economic aid but also social aid through improving access to different facilities, for example, child care institutions. I hope that the European institutions, along with the Member States, will combine their efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I agree with everyone who spoke in the discussion in the spirit of reinforcing our efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe, at EU level, and also in the Member States. I agree with what was emphasised in the discussion: that the centrality of employment policies – the availability and the quality of jobs – is highly important, and therefore employment policies have to play a stronger role.</p>
<p class="contents">Wherever possible, job creation has to be front-loaded and cannot just wait until economic growth and recovery creates jobs again at some point. In programme countries, but also in countries where there is greater room for manoeuvre for the government through targeted interventions and initiatives, I believe it is possible to create jobs and reverse the negative trends.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great role – and this is what we also stressed at the European Platform meeting in Kraków – for social innovation. Perhaps more could have been said about this in today’s discussion. However, we believe that this is going to be an effective tool for finding and disseminating new and effective solutions to poverty. In particular, for example, the situation of minorities and other marginalised and disadvantaged groups, or new areas like digital inclusion, should be explored in this way. That is why it is also very important that, in addition to the ESF and other well-known financial instruments, there will be a new EU-level facility for supporting social innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">More solidarity is needed in the EU but also within the Member States. I believe that, although we are in quite a late and very dangerous phase of the financial crisis, this is now being increasingly recognised. In certain Member States, there are new directions concerning, for example, the role of taxation in fiscal consolidation or the new negotiations on a minimum wage in Germany, which I very strongly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">This connects with the call which I heard from many participants in the debate about further legislative proposals in this area. I believe legislative proposals should not be ruled out, but they only make sense if they have a chance of being passed and implemented. So we have to continue to look at what is really causing the problem here, and how this should be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if we look into the question of how we have arrived at this point, with a huge number and an increasing proportion of badly paid jobs, we should pay attention to a trend which is a polarisation of the wage structure in Europe, particularly as a consequence of the large-scale loss of industrial jobs in the recent past, which was aggravated by the financial and economic crisis. That resulted in the disappearance of many medium-paid jobs, the so-called ‘hollowing out’ effect in the labour market. That, I believe, requires primarily a stronger employment dimension to industrial policies, which is why we have to reinforce industrial policies at EU level and make a stronger connection between job creation and the sustainability of jobs and industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who stressed or hinted that, if macro-economic policies are half-baked, social policies have a very difficult starting point. This is why it is very important that there is better coherence between all these policies, which is what we would like to achieve in the next European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will mention one issue which many Members of the House spoke about: food aid for the deprived. The Commission was, from the very outset, determined to address the legal problem and begin discussions in Council in order to secure the provision of similar quantities of foodstuffs for the next two years. On 3 October, I presented an amended proposal for the pending regulation extending the legal basis to the relevant chapter of the Treaty, i.e. social cohesion. I am extremely happy that the Member States reached a compromise yesterday in the Council. The Commission services will now make the necessary changes in order to ensure the continuation of this scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is important to me.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about minimum income which is a sensitive issue, perhaps because it is surrounded by misunderstanding. We did draft a compromise in our report in relation to this important theme, with the specific features and living standards of each Member State. It takes the balanced view that you, Ms Lynne, have talked about. I think that it is genuinely a measure that must be supported, but with all necessary qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also happy with Commissioner Andor’s statements and intentions, which are in line with Parliament’s wishes, especially regarding employment, child poverty, gender equality, access to social services and, most particularly, further funding of the social cohesion funds. It is essential, Commissioner, for these intentions, for your initiatives and your concrete proposals for 2012 to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, the European Parliament must, along with the Commission, put pressure on Member States so that solidarity among our citizens becomes a reality and a priority within the Union, especially given the crisis that we are currently going through. The more united Parliament is in this struggle, the stronger the signal we shall send. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Combating poverty is quite rightly moving to the fore as a major priority and challenge for the EU: it is our ambition to lift 20 million people out of poverty by 2020. In the past 10 years, the poverty level in the EU has increased or, in the best-case scenario, remained constant. In most countries, the lowest level of benefits and the last safety net has decreased to below the subsistence minimum or minimum wage. We cannot and should not tolerate this: families cannot make ends meet and they live in poverty. I hope that the European platform against poverty and social exclusion will provide an effective platform in our common fight against poverty in the EU. Finally, I would like to turn to the European food programme for the most deprived. Yesterday, a political agreement was reached for the years 2012 and 2013. I think this sends an important signal: after all, the programme is indispensable for around 18 million Europeans whom it supports every year. However, we should certainly not leave it at that: we should also seek to secure proper funding for the post-2013 period so the programme can continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a sad fact that the EU, as one of the richest areas of the world, has more than 80 million citizens at risk of poverty, of whom 20 million are children and more than 6 million belong to the active population. Such a state of affairs is incompatible with the European values and solidarity enshrined in the Treaties. The financial crisis of 2008 has aggravated this phenomenon, as well as increasing the pressure on the most vulnerable sectors of the population. Although the fight against poverty and social exclusion is exclusively within the jurisdiction of Member States, the EU can play an important role in terms of raising awareness of this problem, improving coordination and financing activities in Member States aimed at tackling poverty and social exclusion. This many-sided problem requires an integrated response, including the joint efforts of all levels of public administration, from European to local authority level. I personally believe that local authorities can implement the most effective tools, as they are closest to these groups, and these tools must be supplemented by systemic measures in social systems at the level of every Member State, with the aim of reducing poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conservative right has different priorities to the 116 million people who face the risk of poverty and to the 42 million who live in conditions of severe poverty and cannot afford the necessities for a decent life. It is disgusting that the banking sector is much more important to Europe’s decision makers than the fact that more than a quarter of the EU’s population is faced with the scourge of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and its consequences, which include long-term unemployment affecting one in three unemployed, homelessness, a lack of access to medical care, dropping out of school and social exclusion of the elderly and people with disabilities, are factors which destroy social cohesion between generations and professional groups. I am worried that the platform proposed by the Commission does not take into account the need to combat the increased vulnerability of women, especially of single mothers and elderly women.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to become more involved in supporting European citizens in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.

I would also like to make some comments on the report that are related to the crisis. The acute ‘anti-crisis’ measures are pushing the Europe 2020 strategy measures completely into the background.

The reintegration of the unemployed and marginalised population can, however, release this dormant potential to revitalise the EU’s ailing economies. Crisis management must not therefore overshadow but strengthen anti-poverty measures, since they are indispensable for ensuring the sustainable and inclusive growth enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this light, I would like to welcome this report on this important flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy and the fact that it dedicates a whole section to the inclusion of Roma, who are way over-represented among the poorest. Equally important and mutually reinforcing with the Europe 2020 national reform programmes are the national Roma inclusion strategies, which are to be submitted to the Commission by the end of this year, and I truly hope that despite any political upheaval or budgetary hardship in some of the Member States, the Commission will thoroughly evaluate the professional substantiation, complexity and financial feasibility of the national strategies, and that it will also present specific recommendations for their revision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are richer for the achievements of the first convention of the European platform for cooperation organised by the Commission and the Polish Presidency in October this year in Kraków. The convention has shown that national objectives relating to combating poverty are still insufficient to lift 20 million Europeans out of poverty and social exclusion. This entails the need to revise the objectives and the national reform programmes which, in future, will be the basis of operational programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The convention emphasised the need to focus interventions on areas such as child poverty, youth unemployment and the situation of the elderly, as well as the need for greater involvement of young people in decision-making processes. The most effective way out of poverty is employment. I therefore believe that support for small and medium-sized enterprises is of essential significance. The achievements of the convention indicate that our colleague Mr Daerden’s report reflects the future activities of the platform well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, as a trade economist, I am also keenly aware of the increasing possibility of EU economies re-entering recession in the months ahead. I would like to ask therefore whether the Commission and colleagues would consider a reappraisal of the 0.7% of GNI development aid target in advance of the 2015 deadline? Surely an honest reappraisal would be better for our partners’ planning, and for our own credibility, than the maintenance of a target which is highly likely to be missed. If not, and if the Commission and colleagues agree that additional tax revenues are unlikely to be forthcoming in the years ahead, could the Commission and colleagues clarify which programmes they would recommend cutting to ensure the target for 2015 is met? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union faces a serious challenge, because responsibility for the fight against the many forms of social exclusion primarily rests with the Member States which, struggling with economic problems, introduce savings, and these often primarily affect the most vulnerable people. Therefore, all action taken by the European Commission and Parliament to support the Member States in combating poverty and social exclusion is important. Neither can we allow money from the European Social Fund to be used inefficiently. Millions of euro must not be spent on training which does not help the unemployed to return to work or gain the new qualifications they need. It is very important to create a European platform which will support the most vulnerable social groups, and also for the European Commission to provide adequate supervision of the effectiveness of the money which is spent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the European Union is one of the wealthiest regions in the world, as a result of the economic crisis, poverty and the number of people living on the poverty line has increased significantly. Young people in the European Union are in the most difficult economic situation, and unemployment among them is the highest. In order to avoid falling below the poverty line, they are forced to choose the status of the ‘eternal student’ or live with their parents for longer. Women, whose rate of employment is 13% lower than that of men, and who earn considerably less than men, are also in a complicated situation. As a result, the income of female pensioners is lower, and their risk of falling into poverty is higher. The increase in the number of people continually living in poverty is a threat to European security. Europe needs a balanced society, and I thus strongly support this report, which aims to ensure precisely that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this time of financial difficulty especially, it is important that the EU does not forget about those most in need in our society. Poverty is an issue that must be combated through cooperation between Member States and the EU. At Member State level, nations should consider a wide range of areas, including particular emphasis on education and health, in order to reduce both current and future poverty. Job creation and training should be considered to help those currently struggling below the poverty line. Further investment in education at all levels should be incorporated to prepare future generations to stay out of poverty. Likewise, health, sanitation and other concerns related to individuals’ wellbeing must be addressed. The EU as a whole needs to address poverty through ambitious leadership, such as setting the 2020 target of liberating 20 million people from poverty. We, as Europeans, need to seek justice for all by reducing poverty in the EU and working towards equal opportunities for all, in order to successfully provide citizens with the basic human dignity and rights provided within our Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many EU citizens are suffering from or at risk of acute poverty and the crisis is making this regrettable situation worse. In Austria alone, 12% of the population is at risk of poverty and half of these people are obviously poor. In the majority of Member States which do not have a well developed welfare state, the position is much more extreme. We are responsible for offering these people escape routes. Therefore, we must put in place concrete measures to combat poverty. It is essential for us to strengthen the welfare state and to ensure that high-quality public services are available to everyone. It is not enough to fight against the consequences of poverty. Most importantly, we must identify concrete strategies for preventing poverty. The report recognises the special needs of the groups which are most at risk. It acknowledges that the emphasis of measures to combat child poverty must lie with prevention and, therefore, it makes an important contribution to long-term, sustainable action which will help us to achieve one of the central objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy; in other words, reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million by 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment among young people has shot through the roof in the EU following the economic crisis; it is now over 20% and is reaching critical levels in all the Member States. Allow me to add some figures from my country, from Greece. In a recent survey, 60% of Greeks stated that they live in fear of waking up poor one day, while 50% believe that anyone may ‘be made’ poor by a random event, such as illness or dismissal late in life. The so-called ‘EUR 700 generation’ is the subject of research for contemporary sociologists and economists. Everyone wonders how they manage. As stated in the report, the number of impoverished workers at European level has increased significantly, with 8% of workers living in severe deprivation and 22% of workers at risk of poverty. These numbers should worry us, especially as the Arab Spring was set off by dissatisfaction among young people and their disappointment in their leaders, who failed to offer them a future.

At the same time, when looking for the geographic region of Europe where the phenomenon of poverty is most prevalent, our attentions are easily turned to the new Member States and the region of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, I believe that one of the greatest challenges confronting the EU is regional cohesion and the reduction of the developmental disparities that exist between the regions of Europe. The European values enshrined in the Treaties include solidarity, which clearly implies the maintenance and further reinforcement of cohesion policy. In addition to having a beneficial effect on the economies of the Member States, support to economically less developed regions also approximates the standards of living of citizens in various regions of Europe and thereby contributes to the building of a common Europe and the strengthening of a European identity. Implementation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the reduction of poverty, also requires the strengthening of national economies and the acceleration of their economic growth. The European Union, too, can make a contribution to this, for example, through cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Daerden has rightly stressed the importance of the fight against poverty – poverty among Europeans is one of the main threats to social order in the 21st century. The statistics do not instil optimism. In countries commonly thought of as highly developed, millions of people suffer because of poverty. The scale of the problem is huge, so it is important to promote all initiatives which encourage action on this issue, at both national and EU level. People who are extremely poor often do not know their rights, and are therefore also unable to utilise the help available. Their situation is often the result of a course of events beyond their control, so measures to improve their situation should be undertaken largely by the state. I know the Commission’s initiative which designated the year 2010 as European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion certainly helped to intensify action to improve integration within European society. It is up to us to continue to work for the inclusion of all those who are excluded from society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
