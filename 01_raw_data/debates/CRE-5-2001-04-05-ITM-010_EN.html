If the Government of Cyprus had said this, I would believe it, but others might not. But these are the words of the British police. I think that draws a line under the question of what happened. As to the political significance of what happened, Mr Tsiakourmas was a building contractor who went into the British base, which is close to a Turkish-Cypriot village, and collected Turkish labourers for building work. In other words, this was a man with contacts with both communities, which the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders wish to keep apart and at loggerheads. It was because he was in the delicate position of dealing with his Turkish counterparts in Cyprus that he became the target of this criminal abduction.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say that it is a sorry spectacle to see an arbitrary power which has claimed to be a state for 25 years, which has not been recognised by the international community for 25 years, now trying to impose its de facto presence by engaging in gangster-type abductions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I turn to you. Concern for the fate of the individual is one of the most noble traditions of France, your country and homeland. We need only think of the Dreyfus case, we need only think of Flaubert’s trial, we need only think of Zola’s ‘J’accuse’ trial. Tsiakourmas is, of course, no Dreyfus, Zola or Flaubert. But, in his own small way, he represents the very same problem. Which is why I call on you and the Commission to evince an interest in his case. Let me assure you that, in fighting and claiming his freedom, Tsiakourmas is claiming freedom, peace and reconciliation for the two communities in Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question, of course, is where the illegal occupying regime in northern Cyprus finds the nerve to take such action, especially in an area under British sovereignty. Obviously, if the so-called international community wished to put an end to the occupying regime, it would have the means to do so. This comment applies even more so to the European Union, given that Turkey is a candidate country and Cyprus is already engaged in accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has the means to exert pressure and could use them. At the same time, however, the European Union has huge economic, political and military interests in Turkey and it is obviously these interests that dictate its conduct. Furthermore, it would appear that the very procedure to integrate Cyprus into the European Union is probably complicating the Cyprus question, rather than helping to resolve it. In all events, we call on the European Union and on the Government of the United Kingdom to, at least this once, let Turkey feel the sharp edge of its tongue and ensure that Mr Tsiakourmas is released unconditionally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the time to confine ourselves to polite recommendations to Turkey, whose forces illegally abducted him from inside the British base at Dhekelia in Cyprus and have been holding him in prison ever since, despite the fact that he is seriously ill and his life is in danger. I honestly wonder how Great Britain can accept this breach of its sovereignty without reacting decisively and effectively, which it is perfectly capable of doing, if it so chooses.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the incursion of Turkish occupying forces on to neutral soil in Cyprus, the claim on Greek islands and Turkey’s constant threats that, if the Republic of Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union, Turkey will react violently, as the Minister of the Interior, Mr Cem, stated a few days ago, prove that Turkey saw the decision by the Helsinki Summit as an expression of weakness on the part of Europe. That is why, instead of falling into line with the terms laid down for it to become a member, it has become even more audacious. It is time for the European Union to prove that Turkey cannot pour scorn on our courtesy, tolerance and efforts to help it become a true democracy based on the rule of law before we accept it into the European family with impunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It involves infringement of British sovereign territory and the wrongful arrest of a vulnerable individual who has no record of wrongdoing. It seems to have been an ill conceived tit-for-tat. With some regret, therefore, I have to say that we will support the resolution and I call on the Turkish authorities to release Mr Tsiakourmas now.</p>

When I spoke to the Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister, Mr Kasoulides, last week, I said to him that now was the time to build bridges to Turkish Cypriots, to find ways of reducing the economic isolation of northern Cyprus and to use language that might encourage support for Turkish people for genuine bi-communal and bi-zonal Cyprus as called for in the United Nations resolutions. I say to Turkish Cypriots: avoid stupid incidents and get into constructive dialogue. I say to the Greek Cypriots: stop seizing on opportunities for confrontation and stretch out a hand of friendship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conspiracy of silence has been broken and it has come to light that Catholic priests and bishops are guilty of criminal acts against nuns in at least 23 countries. The report, which was published in the American periodical ‘National Catholic Reporter’, talks of rape, sexual abuse, contamination with AIDS, forced abortions and blackmail and persecution of anyone who has the courage to report these acts of violence to the officials in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">However much the Vatican official, Joachim Navarro Vals, has attempted to play down the issue or restrict it solely to Africa, sexual abuse and violation of the fundamental rights of women are a fact of life and, of course, neither bishops nor priests are above the law. That is precisely why my political group is calling for the perpetrators to be handed over to the authorities and for the judicial authorities in the 23 countries in which these crimes were committed to deal with all the cases of violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Holy See should release the five reports on the matter, strip those responsible of all official titles, work with the judicial authorities, restore the expelled nuns to their positions, give the victims the necessary protection and compensation and, above all, take measures to prevent similar situations from arising in the future and, of course, instruct priests in the fundamental rights of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Highly placed generals were extremely alarmed about the sexual intimidation to which nuns were subjected in certain regions. One mother superior from a diocese where several nuns became pregnant by priests was unable to find a suitable solution. In another community, 20 nuns had to be dismissed because they had become pregnant, in many cases by priests.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, nuns have been harmed in various countries. When one sister became pregnant by a priest, she had to leave the community, whilst the priest involved could carry on with his calling. Is this social justice? The sister is being abandoned in a situation in which she has to raise the child as a single parent and is for the most part subject to considerable stigma in deplorable social circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Examples have been quoted of certain countries where they were obliged to become second and third wives in a family as a result of losing their social status in the local culture.

This is something the Vatican has known about since 1994, but it has tried to play down what has happened and silenced the women when they have tried to speak out or been forced to have abortions. A number of them have also reportedly been infected with AIDS. This is no isolated incident. It has happened in at least 23 countries, and there is only one word to summarise what has happened, and that – emphatically – is ‘disgraceful’.

In our opinion, sexual abuse of women is too serious to be used for political ends and for placing religious communities, in this case the Catholic Church, in a bad light.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider rape and sexual abuse to be violations of fundamental human rights and of human dignity. We reject any form of aggression against women and are of the opinion that offenders need to be punished, irrespective of their profession. We are united in solidarity with the victims. Our group is expressing grave concern with regard to the sexual abuse committed by priests, medical doctors, politicians and others in positions of trust and moral authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Catholic community of faith and the Holy See have always rejected violence and sexual abuse, both on the basis of Christian values and of international treaties and obligations. Via its official representatives, the Holy See has acknowledged and condemned the actions, and has, in cooperation with the responsible bishops, superiors of religious orders and communities and other competent authorities, taken measures against the priests in question. This was done to support the victims and to prevent these eruptions of violence from being repeated. Sexual abuse by priests must be condemned and penalised without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not generalise. There are more than 404 000 priests and nearly 820 000 nuns worldwide. The fact that irresponsible members of the clergy have committed these acts of abuse, especially in developing countries where women often play a subordinate role culturally compared to men, does not mean that the majority of nuns and priests in the world are not dedicated: they are often the first to be self-effacing in the fight for peace and justice and against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group welcomes the open debate in this matter and we regret that the response to sexual abuse has hitherto been inadequate. We want an effective response to all incidents and expect churches and other responsible organisations to step up their efforts to do everything in their power to prevent this from happening in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows complete disregard for the victims and is nothing but inappropriate chicanery. In these cases of rape, which are reprehensible, the catholic nuns’ suffering was twofold: they suffered both as women and as nuns within a holy order. Their vocation to serve others was offended against, as was the God in whom they believe. The Catholic Church has also been offended by the reprehensible actions of some of its members. When reality is exaggerated, facts are distorted and attempts are made to attack not the rapists but the church to which the nuns belong, many nuns feel violated a second time, now by this grotesque act of political manipulation. In dealing with this matter, understanding and respect for religion are required. Clearly this is not the position of those tabling the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal attacks those who have attacked the problem, betrays a complete ignorance or scorn for the organisation of the Catholic Church itself, which is not the centralised European superstate that many people consider it to be. It is profoundly decentralised, both its Diocesan College and in its numerous institutes and religious congregations, as well as in other areas. This resolution could have attacked those who have violated and betrayed the service of God. But no, in an instant it passes swiftly over these, these few bad examples, and rains blows down on the Church as a whole. It was the Church that discovered these cases, debated them and then dealt with them as soon the facts were known. The Church deserves our appreciation for this as well as for everything else it has done for the communities it helps. It certainly does not deserve this misguided attack. Furthermore, it was the Church that brought these cases to our attention, not the frenzied proponents of a paradoxical text that attacks the solution instead of the problem. I voted against the proposal. It is completely lacking in humanity and is nothing but a monument to cynicism and hypocrisy. I speak on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and, particularly on behalf of the Irish delegation, who expressly asked me to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My heart goes out to the abused women within the Roman Catholic Church when I read about their plight. I therefore sincerely hope that this debate will help put an end to these wrongs for good. I assume that this is the intention of those submitting the resolution and that they are not being led by anti-religious feelings.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the resolution not only addresses the Vatican, it also appeals to all church authorities to act in line with Christian ethics. The individual’s responsibility should not disappear in the anonymity of large institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no mitigating circumstances for the behaviour of the African priests involved. Neither their young age, nor different cultural notions regarding celibacy could justify these acts of violence. Any Christian denomination based on the Bible knows that abuse of women cannot be covered by the cloak of charity. We dishonour the name of Christ if we deal with these issues in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution calls for a judicial procedure to provide a full account of the events – and rightly so. Based on my Christian faith, I should like to give my unqualified support to this appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the extent of this problem, we can only guess at the moment. The American magazine ‘National Catholic Reporter’ lists 23 countries where sexual abuse occurs. In any event, it is more than a marginal phenomenon. As long ago as 1994, there were reports of cases of abuse, but so far it has been unclear as to what action was taken to prevent violence against women. The Vatican must recognise the relevant issue and must give a clear account of the measures which are being taken to ban such practices in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the scrapping of recital H from the original resolution. If this had not been done, I would have had no option but to vote against the resolution. However much I denounce the distressing cases of abuse, these should not simply be associated with the Vatican’s policy on women’s reproductive rights. Bringing a pro-life approach to these issues into discredit in this way is inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But this resolution contains inaccuracies, distortions, lies and half-truths and so cannot be accepted. I believe this issue is too serious to be used as a party-political and ideological football. However, that is exactly what is happening. The Vatican has neither a global police force nor a global court to pursue these matters. But above all this is an issue for the state authorities. Of course, we support the Holy See in its efforts to combat these practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear, however, about one thing. As Mrs Malmström has stated quite openly, this resolution clearly aims to weaken the role of the Holy See in international organisations where it is used on behalf of the family, for the protection of life, and against sexual abuse. This is often not the case with the governments of many Member States. This resolution is hypocritical and unacceptable. I therefore consider it to be dangerous because this issue was all too often abused in the twentieth century by totalitarian powers in order to discredit the Church. We must not go down this path.

I cannot, however, support this resolution which targets one specific church; a church which has acknowledged and condemned the cases in question and which has made clear it is taking measures in cooperation with the competent church representatives and civil authorities against the perpetrators involved. It is also supporting the victims, as it does sexual-abuse victims, through its outreach programmes through the world and it is taking steps to prevent a repetition of these terrible incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Regretfully, it must be said that resolutions of this nature suggest an ulterior motive for political reasons, which appears to be the deliberate discrediting of the Catholic Church and the Holy See on an international level and possibly forcing its removal from international forums, where it is actively promoting the dignity of women and mothers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to add the following. This sensitive and appalling issue came to light thanks to the openness of the Catholic press and to Catholic researchers who had drawn up a report. Eventually, the Catholic Church hierarchy reacted to, and condemned, these events. I also remember bishops, from the Netherlands for example, making statements.</p>
<p class="contents">So why are we rubbing salt into the wound of the Roman Catholic Church? As a Protestant, I must say that I am very surprised about this, to say the least. I read an interview in the Dutch press with one of the people who started the ball rolling and in which the background was explained. She says: “We are against the Pope visiting the European Parliament. We must make it more difficult in this way. Secondly, we would really like to give as good as we get with regard to all the Pope’s admonitions in the moral sphere.” If that is the background, there is so much false fire on the altar, to put it in Protestant terms, that it is absolutely impossible for me to back this resolution. I also think that those nuns who suffered in the course of these events are now also being abused politically, something about which I am ashamed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The recent arrests of politicians in Pakistan are, unfortunately, a cruel statement of failure. These mass arrests of more than a thousand people are a good illustration of the determination of the regime of General Musharraf to quell the democratic aspirations of the Pakistani people and to prevent political parties from carrying out their legitimate activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, a few months after the coup, in my capacity as Vice-Chairman of the South East Asia delegation, I met the ambassador of Pakistan, at his request, who ensured me that the military junta which had just snatched power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would quickly prepare the ground for a democratic Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now, however, witnessing the intolerable radicalisation of this regime and the words ‘democracy’, ‘human rights’ and ‘political pluralism’ are being written in letters of blood in Pakistan. The inspiration born of democratisation – that we had longed to see – quickly gave way to intolerance and arbitrary arrests.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament cannot remain silent when faced with a situation which holds sway in a country with which the European Union has cooperated for so long. We owe it to ourselves to make it clear to General Musharraf that respect for human rights and democracy is what makes a policy of cooperation meaningful. We owe it to ourselves to ask him to organise free, pluralist and transparent elections as soon as possible, which the Supreme Court of Pakistan has also called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The police arrested the very people who fight for solidarity and justice and, instead of arresting activists who have gone underground, they arrest their family members. Among those arrested was Nasrullah Khan, the leader of the democratic renewal movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The behaviour of the military regime in Pakistan is absolutely unacceptable. Credence can no longer be given to the reassurances and declarations of intention given by its ruler. Pakistan must fulfil its obligations as a member of the United Nations. These obligations include securing freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that it is no longer enough for the international community simply to complain. We call on the Commission to exert all its political clout and fight for the early release of the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">The leader of the military regime, General Musharraf, is responsible for continuing to obstruct a return to democracy and humanity. The stability of the ruler of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan both at home and abroad is just for show. It will only be for real when the ruling of the Supreme Court to allow free national elections is implemented. The deadlines for these elections to take place must be adhered to. Independent parties must be allowed to field candidates. They must stop being exposed to constant pressure. These elections must take place under the supervision of international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the sphere of human rights, the European Union must be active in Pakistan and must involve people who often risk life and limb in campaigning on behalf of human rights issues, namely the NGOs. We are obliged to do this. This would be our contribution to a great national day in Pakistan. Commissioner, we hope we will succeed.</p>

There is nothing left of democracy, and the prospects are gloomy. The announcement of elections appears to be no more than a diversion to mislead the international community. Active party members of the opposition are being apprehended. Election campaigns have been rendered impossible, and the independence of the judiciary has been compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the World Bank is agonising over economic reform in Pakistan, the military regime is wrecking democracy. No democracy means no stability, and no stability means no economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage. The financial and military support granted by the military regime to the Taliban barbarians in Afghanistan is repugnant. According to the Afghan opposition leader, who is on a visit here today, only political reform in Pakistan can lead to the downfall of the Muslim extremists in the neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was right to halt the negotiations with Pakistan. As long as democracy has not been fully re-established, there cannot be any hope of a cooperation agreement. The political dialogue can only be continued on an ad hoc basis and, in this connection, the regime has to be put under great pressure to hold fair elections soon.</p>

Aid for elections can only be granted if it contributes to a fair course of events. The chance of that happening appears extremely remote for the time being.</p>

According to this President, Jews and black people have to be arrested, gaoled and exiled. End of quote.</p>
<p class="contents">You probably wonder which country this report is about, and the timeframe in which it is set. After all, we are only too aware of the historical examples. Replace Jews and blacks by homosexual men and women, and you will realise that I am referring to the very recent statements by the President of Namibia where it appears, not for the first time, that a witch-hunt is being launched. Namibia’s President made his appeal to cleanse his country, as he said, of homosexuals, on 19 March. Despite numerous protests, both from Namibia and elsewhere, he repeated this appeal earlier this week. It is thus not a slip of the tongue but a deliberate campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">On previous occasions, the anti-homosexual rhetoric uttered by the Namibian President could be laughed off. It seemed to be a personal hobbyhorse of a frightened man who was desperate to hold on to traditional village life. The President’s statements conjure up an image of a community which seems to be losing the battle against sexual promiscuity. However, the criminalisation of homosexuals, mixed in with a generous portion of xenophobia, and the call on Namibian women to know their place, do nothing to address the problem. On the contrary, exploiting the fear of AIDS in this manner is playing with fire. Straightforward advice and the distribution of condoms would be a better solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Namibia’s anti-homosexual campaign forms a threat, not only to the physical well-being of the potential victims, but also to democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Amnesty International has declared that it considers people who are gaoled on the grounds of their sexual preference or for exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly to be prisoners of conscience. Namibia must be reminded of its international obligations, which signify that human rights apply to everyone and are universal and indivisible. It is crucial, therefore, for the European Union to ask Namibia, in no uncertain terms, to halt this witch-hunt. Let Namibia follow the lead of its neighbour, South Africa, where the rights of homosexuals are explicitly guaranteed in the constitution. Surely, a country which has fought for its own freedom and against racial discrimination and apartheid cannot embrace sexual discrimination and apartheid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discrimination against, and persecution of, people with this orientation who openly acknowledge it are no longer of all times and all cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there is a steady decrease in discrimination in a large number of countries. Incitement to exclude, and use violence against, people of this orientation is increasingly becoming less acceptable. A good example is South Africa. After the apartheid regime was abolished, a clause was included in the constitution which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument used by the Namibian President that homosexuality is a Western phenomenon, an aberration of the West, is a nonsense argument.

This is the year 2001. Mr Lagendijk was right to point out that, unfortunately, Namibia is not the only African country which is taking things to such extremes. President Mugabe of Zimbabwe terms homosexuals and lesbians, in his own words: ‘animals which have to be exterminated’. His henchmen will take care of the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, unacceptable that people should be discriminated against simply on the basis of their sexual preference. However, I appreciate how very delicate and difficult this debate is. In Africa, I found out that many people consider homosexuality as something which goes against their culture. Respect for culture, however, comes up against its own boundaries when fundamental human rights are at risk. Homophobic actions, largely orchestrated by the Government, must be unequivocally condemned. However, this should not be all that is done.</p>
<p class="contents">In the spirit of the new Cotonou Agreement, I believe that the persecution of homosexuals should be taken into consideration in the assessment of our cooperation with developing countries. After all, the persecution of homosexuals is often not the only violation of human rights in the countries concerned. Despite their elevated ideals, certain SADEC countries have recently been repeatedly showing their less attractive sides. It is high time that a fresh wind blew through Windhoek and that the homosexual wall in a number of frontline states was razed to the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. –<span class="italic"> (FR) </span>As regards the first item, which is the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the Commission is familiar with the circumstances surrounding the arrest of this Greek Cypriot citizen last December. It has emerged that Mr Tsiakourmas was abducted on the sovereign territory of a British base in Dhekalia. The British Government raised the issue on a number of occasions both with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and with the authorities in Ankara. The General Affairs Council is going to look into this case when it meets next Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we in the Commission are still keeping a watchful eye on developments in the situation from our delegation office in Nicosia. According to our information, the proceedings which were opened against Mr Tsiakourmas resumed this week in Famagusta and a verdict is expected shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Katiforis, I think that this case, like many others, must be seen in the context of the political situation in Cyprus. We are taking every opportunity to contact the parties involved in order, as you know, to try to promote a political solution to the partitioning of the island. As regards the Turkish side, which Mr MacCormick and Mr Alyssandrakis mentioned, you can rest assured that this topic is amongst those we will be dealing with within the framework of the political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey, which was strengthened by the European Council in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the second item under the heading of human rights, which is your motion for a resolution on violence against nuns, we feel that the case of the Catholic nuns constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental rights of women and is a dreadful example of violence against them. As those who have taken the floor know, the European Union is firmly committed to combating violence against women. In all the institutions we are firmly committed to upholding the principles contained in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and, in particular, to working to ensure that the commitments entered into in Beijing not very long ago during the fourth women’s conference are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as human rights in Pakistan are concerned, the Commission shares the view of the honourable Members who tabled resolutions on this subject when they state that the recent arrests of so-called political activists belonging to the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy are a major concern. During talks with the Pakistani Government last November, the EU troika called on the administration to lift restrictions on the activities of political parties, in particular, the ban on public demonstrations. Political parties cannot and must not be excluded from political life in Pakistan any more than elsewhere, since it is clear they are called upon to play an important role in the country’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are expecting to see tangible progress in the restoration of representative democracy at all levels, beginning with the holding of elections in provincial and national assemblies on the basis of a clear and credible timetable. The Pakistani authorities have given a firm commitment to the EU troika that it will respect the timeframe, which was established by the Supreme Court, of three years following the military coup until the organisation of these elections. Although the Government has confirmed that the political parties will be authorised to take part in provincial and national elections, as a number of you have said, it is clear that only the rapid lifting of the ban on public demonstrations will boost confidence in the process to restore democracy in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the last item is concerned, which is the situation of homosexuals in Namibia, like the authors of this resolution, we were amazed and concerned to read the recent statement on homosexuality which was given by the Namibian President, Sam Nujoma, calling for the persecution of people identified as homosexuals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always upheld the position that all individuals are entitled to benefit from human rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe that all nations must protect and promote these rights and actively contribute to abolishing any form of discrimination on grounds of race, gender, political opinion, religious beliefs and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position also reflects the position which was publicly adopted by the Government of the Republic of Namibia, evidence of which can be found in its constitution and in all the international conventions on human rights which this country has ratified. As a result, we are in favour of any overtures made to the Namibian authorities to try to clarify this matter and to express the wish that these recent statements do not constitute a repudiation of Namibia’s existing constitutional provisions, which ban such discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
