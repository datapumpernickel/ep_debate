<p class="contents">On that occasion, I announced the Commission’s intention to enter into discussions with FIFA and other interested parties, led by my fellow Commissioner, Mario Monti, and with the collaboration of Anna Diamantopoulou, in order to bring FIFA regulations into line with Community law with due regard for, firstly, the specific characteristics of sport and, secondly, the autonomy of sporting organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the Declaration on the specific characteristics of sport, adopted by the European Council in Nice in December 2000, fully supported this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, following intense discussions between the Commission departments, FIFA and the other interested parties, I am pleased to be able to announce the result we have obtained. This outcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, respects the principles which I have just outlined and to which we are all committed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this entire business, the Commission has frequently been accused of failing to understand sport or, worse still, of wishing to destabilise football. Yet the outcome of the discussions proves that such accusations are unfounded. Indeed, I believe that these discussions have provided a further opportunity to demonstrate that Community law and the specific characteristics of sport are perfectly compatible. I therefore see no need to amend Community law. In this instance, the Commission has shown itself to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate the specific characteristics of sport within existing texts.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions have led to clear progress in at least three key areas. Firstly, a goal which the European Parliament has always sought, protecting young players moving within the European Union, guaranteeing them an appropriate general and sporting education. These principles will be included in a code of conduct drawn up by the football federations, and I attach special importance to this point since in my opinion it is far more effective to support the work of these young players rather than to impose restrictions on their movement, which would, in any case, not be compatible with the principle of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that, in football, many are called but few are chosen, and not every player is destined to be a football star. We must therefore ensure that they are given vocational training as well as sports training. With these provisions the Commission hopes to send a clear message to all those young players who put a lot of effort into football: although they will not all make it at the professional level, they will all be treated with due consideration in human terms and in terms of their individual development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second component involves encouraging and compensating the effort made by clubs to train young people, thereby giving their sports activities a social dimension, which, moreover, is a characteristic of the European dimension of sport. In order to achieve this, FIFA has undertaken to introduce rules dealing with: firstly, compensation for training costs incurred up to the age of 23, on the basis of real costs, in line with the Court’s judgment in the Bosman case, and secondly, the creation of a solidarity fund which will be sustained by a 5% levy on each compensation payment for transfer. This fund is intended for the training clubs, who will thereby receive a share of the player’s added value.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to FIFA to apply these principles in detail. The Commission will, within its sphere of responsibility, ensure that the incorporation of these principles into FIFA’s rules is effectively achieved, and I am sure, Madam President, that the Commission will not be alone, but will be supported in this monitoring work by both the Sports Ministers and the Members of Parliaments who have made commitments at national level. We are convinced, then, that it is possible to find a balance between a player’s mobility and the necessary compensation of the training club within the limits laid down by the Court in the Bosman case.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the introduction of elements of stability into sporting competitions in order to ensure their equity and regularity.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the mechanisms intended to achieve this. Firstly, unilateral termination of a contract will be authorised only at the end of a season. This means that a club’s fans have some guarantee of seeing the same team play throughout the season, because this is the team that they have bought their season tickets to see, not another team, which may perhaps have lost its best players.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the imposition of disciplinary measures on players and clubs who terminate their contracts during its first two seasons without just cause or valid reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles are supported by other important points, such as fixed periods for transfers or the duration of contracts of between one and five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of our discussions, we met with FIFPRO, which represent the players. Some of their requests were met. For instance, FIFA rules will no longer prohibit players from going to court, but also a special Court of Arbitration will be set up, based on equal representation, which will be able to settle disputes concerning training fees, transfers and disciplinary measures. I attach particular importance to arbitration being independent and based on equal representation. The creation of an arbitration body of this kind to which matters can be referred by both players and clubs should resolve disputes fairly, quickly and efficiently. I should like to point out, too, that throughout this affair, the Commission has emphasised that the discussions between it, FIFA and the other interested parties in no way affect the compatibility of FIFA’s revised rules with national laws in force, and in particular with employment law. It is FIFA’s responsibility to ensure that the rules are applied in accordance with national legislation from which they cannot, of course, depart.</p>
<p class="contents">FIFA has announced that the principles thus agreed will be implemented by a revision of FIFA rules at its world congress in Buenos Aires in July. The Commission has urged FIFA to seek close dialogue with the other interested parties with a view to such implementation, most particularly, of course, the players.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s opinion, the discussions on transfers have clearly shown that dialogue at all levels is becoming a necessity and that all possible avenues for organising dialogue should be explored, including collective agreements at the European level. Indeed, Mrs Diamantopoulou offered her assistance in supporting ongoing dialogue at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this statement I would remind you that, after the first two years, FIFA will draw up a report on the application of this system. We will then have quantitative and qualitative information from which we can learn.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I believe we must be very pleased with the outcome of these discussions, not, Madam President, that it was always very easy to arrive at an outcome. On more than one occasion, concluding a discussion was delayed due to the pressure brought to bear by some Heads of State and Government, which was considerable pressure, but pointless and, above all, harmful. Be that as it may, the Commission held its ground and was ultimately able to demonstrate that it is not necessary to amend the terms of the Treaty in order to respect the specific characteristics of sport; it therefore stood firm while keeping strictly to its own sphere of responsibility. As a result of this outcome, my fellow Commissioner, Mario Monti, will not need to propose that the Commission adopt a negative decision concerning FIFA transfer rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, of course, all pleased that a compromise has finally been reached, and I have, in fact, always agreed with you that the Commission clearly does not want to destroy football. I got a few bloody noses at home for supporting you to such an extent, but by now I think that even the rather rude Mr Beckenbauer will have recognised that you are not trying to destroy his beloved football. That is why I am pleased about the compromise, but I would like to ask you one thing now. Putting to one side for the time being those who for a wide variety of reasons will gain from this compromise – young sportsmen and women, small sports clubs, large sports clubs – are you not worried that this compromise, which treats sportsmen and women up to the age of 28 differently from those older than that, could lead to a violation of the principle of equality? Are you not worried that in the end there will be even more Bosman judgments, by which I mean that courts exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction may take a different view to that represented by this compromise? Are you not concerned that this could lead to us being buried in a veritable avalanche of court cases? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If any citizen, whether or not they are a footballer, whether or not they are a club member, decides to take a case to the Court, then he is perfectly free so to do. We even insisted that this freedom be explicitly stated in the compromise because the Court of Arbitration, which is to be specific to the world of football, will, of course, be used to settle any disputes that arise, but we would like to see these disputes settled within the footballing family, and not necessarily in the public arena. Nonetheless, citizens’ freedoms require that if a person does not find any solution within the footballing family, he can then refer the case to either national or European Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s action was fully compliant with this Declaration. On the basis of the Treaty provisions and also taking into consideration the views of the Heads of State and Government as expressed in Nice in the Declaration on the specific characteristics of sport, the Commission has established a framework together with FIFA, while acknowledging an element of autonomy for sporting bodies and the procedure they are now going to use to settle details. In that context, the agreement proposed by FIFA has not been signed by the Commission, yet the Commission in the letter which Mr Monti, as lead Commissioner in this matter, sent to Mr Blatter stated that if the fine principles contained in the FIFA proposal are put into practice then the Commission may not have to issue a ban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions about that.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I assume the solidarity fund is a general fund. Is there any chance that a portion of the transfer fee for under-23s might go directly to the amateur club which nurtured their skills? You also need to look at the footballing academies in England to which young footballers are taken from Ireland at a very young age. Will there be some compensation for them?</p>
<p class="contents">The scandalous exploitation of young African footballers is a problem which I would ask you to look at again, because it does not seem to me to be addressed by the ban on inter-club transfers. Agents will still find a way of getting round that. I recognise that this was a difficult compromise which does address the problem – the potentially disastrous consequences of absolute freedom of movement – while at the same time recognising the need to respect the new law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have indeed succeeded in providing more than a solution to the problem of Community law pure and simple; we have also guaranteed stability for young people and also solidarity and protection. Regarding the solidarity fund, there are two solidarity systems in place to compensate the training clubs. Firstly, at the time of a transfer, training costs are reimbursed for the club responsible for training the young player, and that is applicable up to the age of 12. There are two reasons, however, why these allocations cannot be too high. Firstly we must adhere to the Bosman judgment. Secondly if training fees were too high, then it would be too difficult for young footballers to be transferred from one club to another, all but the very best players. However, we have to also protect footballers and young teenagers, so training fees must not be too high.</p>
<p class="contents">The second component is the solidarity fund. This solidarity fund will be sustained by a 5% levy on each compensation payment for transfer. In this respect it is the player’s value and not the money invested in training him which will count. There will therefore be a duplicate transfer system for clubs offering training. My hope – and this has been my objective in negotiating – is that the money will get back to the clubs at grass roots level which are so necessary in giving European sport a social dimension. Such clubs play a prime social role in our villages and small towns and they must be given the opportunity to continue this work.</p>
<p class="contents">We preferred not to prevent the free movement of young African players or, as you said, youths from third countries so as not to hinder the free movement of European youth, but we did seek to impose some conditions on the way that third-country nationals were treated by clubs offering training. The problem arises not in their travelling but in the way they are treated in the host country. The code of conduct is intended to ensure that the clubs offering training actually take proper charge of these young people and do not train them simply as sportsmen but offer them an all-round education and preparation for life, for of course not everyone who has received sports training will become football stars or even have a professional career in the game. Of course, the young people that are accepted into the European Union, even if they come from third countries, will benefit from equal treatment. According to this code of conduct, not only will no distinction be made between young people from European countries and those from candidate countries, but young third-country nationals that have entered the European Union legally will also have the opportunity to be treated on the same terms. You may rest assured that the Commission will carefully monitor the framing and implementation of this code of conduct. I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that you too, as Members of the European Parliament, in your work at grassroots level, will note the way in which the code of conduct has been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the free movement of young people from third countries, FIFA has stated that this was not within our remit since we had power to regulate only within the European Union. Outside the European Union and associated countries they intended to purely and simply ban the transfer of youths of less than 18 years of age. This is a unilateral decision by FIFA which must therefore apply to citizens from third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Players undergo training between 12 and 23 years of age and training costs are paid in the event of a player under the age of 23 transferring clubs. It is considered that training is completed by the age of 23.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the length of contracts and the possibility of terminating a contract, from the outset we always said that <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span>; in other words, if an adult signs a contract, the contract is binding. A contract is not there to be terminated, it is there to be observed, not forgetting that the rules of the sport also apply. If, during a championship, clubs start to buy players left, right and centre, they are upsetting the balance of the championship. Furthermore, if, during a championship, players rightly or wrongly leave their team, this is not simply a personal matter for them – it also destabilises the team. All these considerations, which are specific to the sport, led us to put in place measures to ensure the stability of contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">So, whatever a player’s age, a contract cannot be terminated during the championship, nor can it be terminated outside of the championship if the contract extends beyond it, except for very specific reasons, such as a player being injured or a change in the team’s system. It will be a matter for the court, the Court of Arbitration, to judge who is right. If a player terminates his contract in the first two years and does not have a specific reason, disciplinary measures will be imposed. As far as possible, we have tried to limit these disciplinary measures, because, at the beginning, sports authorities were considering measures lasting one or even two years, which would have totally destroyed the career of a professional player. That is why we agreed to have disciplinary measures lasting four months, which could be extended to six months for repeat offenders or for someone who has already tried this trick several times before.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure the stability of teams and the championship, therefore, we agreed on these measures, which are to be put in place not by the Commission, but by the national, European and international federations. I must inform you that we did not want disciplinary measures to be taken solely against players, because clubs often sell their players for purely commercial reasons rather than reasons related to sport. So disciplinary measures will also be taken against clubs and against agents who encourage players to leave their clubs, thereby affecting the stability of their contracts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also why, unlike my fellow MEPs, I am disappointed about the outcome of the negotiations which is now before us. Of course, the proposal contains some sound points, such as compensation for training costs. I am still left wondering about this, because the Commissioner’s response to my previous question was, in my opinion, not satisfactory. If the cost of training is paid, even at the end of a contract, even at the time when a club wants to be rid of its player, this will be at odds with the Bosman judgment. After all, either the compensation will be too low, in which case it is not a true reflection of the actual cost of training, or it will be very high and will clash with the Bosman judgment which stipulates that, at the end of a contract, no remuneration of any kind may be paid to the club.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, my biggest disappointment concerns the very essence of the present transfer system, namely the existence of transfer fees. You have to admit that the Commission has not been able to change this aspect. It will be possible, in future too, for the club and player to agree in their joint contracts on transfer fees which are unlimited and which can rise to the same absurd heights as they do at the moment. I think that you should be generous enough to admit that the Commission has suffered a huge defeat in this respect, and that the essence of the present system remains intact. In my opinion, FIFA’s proposal is nothing but a cosmetic change to, and, in some respects, an improvement on, the current system, but the essence of that system, the existence of transfer fees, remains in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We still have no answer on the issue of training compensation.

So far I cannot see how training compensation is going to deliver that.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's <span class="italic">Times </span>newspaper UEFA and FIFA are clearly indicating that this will lead to lower transfer fees, which has a knock-on impact, particularly for smaller clubs in my area.</p>

The Football League never discussed the matter with UEFA and yet I believe that, in a democracy, which is also called upon to play a role within our sporting federations, discussions between the main parties should be the order of the day. On this point, I must also inform you that my colleague, Anna Diamantopoulou, who is responsible for the free movement of workers, has been taken aback by the lack of talks between clubs and players, for example. She suggested that she might assist, so that discussions on collective European negotiations may be held in the future.

I wonder whether it would not have been wiser to have carried out an assessment of the economic impact on small clubs before you travelled down this road. Many of the smaller clubs in my region, who cradle players for the obvious talents of the north-west clubs in the UK, are particularly worried about this.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a lot of talk about football here today, but you mentioned sport and this is specifically a sports remit. Other sports have transfer fees and I wonder which other sports you have discussed this with.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it very interesting that players now have different rights depending on their age – 23 being the case in point here. I was wondering for Commissioner Diamantopoulou whether this sets a precedent for other European employment legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the changes to FIFA rules and regulations. The calculation behind the effective training costs was recently posted on the FIFA website. FIFA state it would be impossible to do this for individual players so they want to do this by league and type of club. This recommendation means that the smaller the club, the smaller the amount of money the club will receive in compensation for training costs. The categories are a category-one club of a top level, with a high quality training centre; category two: still professional but on a lower level – second division clubs in the UK; category three: all types of third-division clubs, as in the UK; category four: amateur players – Vauxhall Conference and other amateur footballers.

I think that because the UK football authorities are autonomous and because this autonomy has been fully acknowledged, they should deal with this matter. The Commission’s opinion is that this should be dealt with in a transparent fashion and that all parties such as rich clubs, less wealthy clubs, prominent, young and average players, should all be involved in the discussions. I certainly hope that transparency and democracy come into play.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to the issue of training costs, we consider this issue to be quite straightforward. These costs cannot be excessive otherwise they would constitute a barrier to free movement and they would clearly be in total contradiction of the Bosman judgment. That is why a ceiling will be imposed on the costs. My second point, which reiterates what I said in my introductory speech, is we believe that solidarity is an extremely important factor. Training costs and the solidarity funds, therefore, must be cascaded downwards, precisely in order to protect the smaller clubs. I made this point very clear and it is also part of the Nice Declaration. With sport, we have a social responsibility, particularly towards the majority at the bottom of the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that this agreement has enabled us to do two things.

In order words, you said that the Commission too recognises the special character of sport. Now, my question is this: that being so, why was it that before Nice the Commission did not press for the special character of sport to be included in the Treaty alongside culture, and in fact seemed to be opposed to including this in the Treaty? The fact is that they are not the same, because there may still be some uncertainty here. The ruling by the Court of Justice on some of the points that were settled and on others that still have to be resolved is still vulnerable and, in fact, the specific character of sport in general and of football in particular will not be safeguarded until they are clearly and specifically recognised in the Treaties. So I would like to ask you if the Commission still maintains that it is neither necessary nor helpful to have a clear reference in the Treaty to the special character of sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since that time, the Commission’s entire policy has taken the specific characteristics of sport into consideration. Furthermore, only in December 1999, a Commission statement on the social dimension of sport was submitted to the Heads of State and Government at the Helsinki Summit. And nothing has changed since then. We have done more about the specific characteristics of sport than merely make a statement we have put words into practice. We should, nonetheless, be well aware that any future Treaty will include an article on the specific characteristics of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, this will not mean an end of the right to competition, free movement, or any of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Treaty, because people in the sporting world are not above the Treaty. So, I hope this is perfectly clear. It would be very useful for me, as Commissioner for Sport, to have the specific characteristics of sport included, because I could at last! create a programme specific to sport, which I alone am currently unable to do. I always have to consider aspects such as education, health and culture as well; in other words, all the other components that are included in the Treaty. We have, then, always respected the specific characteristics of sport. To make an exception for sport, which is what some people would like to see, and which would mean that the rules of the Treaty do not apply to sport, is something to which I am firmly opposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view – and, furthermore, I intend, during the Belgian Presidency, to present a proposal on this issue to the Ministers for Sport – these measures could be extended to cover other sports, because the protection of young people concerns all other sports as well as football, and the same goes for solidarity between the clubs in the premier division and the small clubs who put in the initial work.

Mrs Dimantopoulou has also recently written to the clubs and the players to ensure that, finally, this social dialogue can get off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commissioners responsible for this issue met the players’ associations on a regular basis because we thought that it made sense for the great footballing family to come together. Unfortunately, this has not always been how it works in practice. That is why we talked with both parties throughout the developments in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to inform you that our constant concern was to protect the rights conferred on employees by the Treaties, even if sport does have specific characteristics. Furthermore, in order to ensure that<span class="underline"> </span>sport operates properly, a professional football player cannot be treated in the same way as a steelworker. Everyone understands this. Furthermore, some aspects of the agreement are obvious; for example, the protection of young people refers specifically to young players. The disciplinary measures were toned down considerably compared to what had been asked and was expected at the beginning. That is a benefit for sportsmen and women. Who then benefits from the stability of the championships and teams? Sport is the prime beneficiary, then the fans and spectators, but professional players benefit as well. Indeed, would they still benefit from playing if sport were destroyed?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Court of Arbitration, we insisted that the court be made up of equal numbers of players and club representatives. I believe that this is a major step forward for players, and I hope that the offer made by my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, will be accepted so that, in this area as well, we see the beginnings of a genuine social dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I ask because I believe it is very important to have a set schedule and a set time frame here. My other question is about the transfer fee level, which is still unlimited. So the question arises of how the solidarity fund will work, if it is really going to benefit the very smallest clubs. You mentioned 5% of the transfer fee, which would then be shared out. However, the key question is how this amount will be distributed and if it will then really benefit the clubs on the bottom rung of the ladder. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The FIFA world congress takes place in Buenos Aires at the beginning of July, and FIFA will then be aiming to incorporate into its rules all the broad principles that were collectively agreed. These broad principles must be put into practice when applying the new rules of world football.</p>
<p class="contents">To deal specifically with the question of transfer fees, I have already answered a question on this subject. We did not receive any complaints about the levels of transfer fees. I have my own view on this, and, no doubt, you do as well. The autonomy of federations should, however, enable this to be settled fairly easily, for example, by setting minimum and maximum levels. There could be rules, for example, to specify that only clubs that do not have a huge deficit would be allowed to make transfers against payment, but it is not up to the Commission to regulate everything, everywhere. There are very distinct responsibilities and national and European federations have a fair share of responsibilities to shoulder in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that what we have just decided is not a substitute for national law. The rules in national law, and particularly the rules in employment law, could be changed in Member States to take account of the specific characteristics of sport. We noticed that some Heads of State and Governments were extremely committed to football! Therefore, if this commitment is put into practice on the ground, in the Member States, this will apply to football and to sport as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a statement on sport that I will be sending firstly to the Commission and then to Parliament, I will therefore propose that 2004 be declared the European Year of Sport and that, in this way, school children be introduced to this other aspect of sport, which is distinct from the business side of things, in other words, the sport of fair play, the true values of our society. As part of the Youth Programme for example, young voluntary workers could also be asked to become involved in the Olympic Games. I can inform you now that I had a meeting with the Chairman of the Athens 2004 Organising Committee, to ask if the torch, which is symbolic of the Olympics and their values, could travel through Europe before finishing its journey in Athens so that the torch could become a catalyst in every European country for discussions on the true values of sport, which might enable these values to be put into practice almost everywhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously everybody is looking into the detail now and although we were very excited when we first got the agreement, I think a lot of people would agree that it is going to be quite difficult to find out whether it is going to benefit some of the smaller clubs – in particular, academy clubs – as much as we hoped. I know this has been touched on, but Stoke City in my constituency has an academy club as good as Manchester United and my fear is that it will get less money because it is not in the premier league.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Commissioner to say whether she is going to look again at whether all clubs could be treated on the same level. I know FIFA has recommended it.

It is, of course, obvious that neither the Commission nor this House would ever allow themselves to interfere in the judges’ work. It is fortunate that democracy is founded on the division of powers. It is therefore up to the judges in the Court in Luxembourg to decide on their course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would however like to mention that, last year, the judges issued a ruling in two cases that had important implications for sport. The rulings that were issued show that the Court in Luxembourg takes into account the independence of federations as well as the social dimension of sport. I am referring to the Lehtonen and the Liège rulings. With regard to the Balog ruling, we have to respect the judgment of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the omnipresent fear that the system of the richest clubs transferring money to less wealthy clubs will not work properly, I, unfortunately, can say no more about this. There was a demand for this system. It has been decided how the system will work and we will only know if it works when it is implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I also expect the Members of Parliament who are involved in this issue to inform the Commission when, in their constituency, they notice that the system is not working as it should under the terms of the agreement between the Commission and FIFA. I believe that we should work together more closely on this, because what we all want is to protect the social dimension of sport, to protect smaller clubs and to protect young players.

This can now be regarded as a precedent, and this obviously leads to the question as to how then all the other ball games and individual sports will be treated in the future, and how the rules that apply to them might possibly change, as each sport is obviously different and limits on age and training vary greatly between them. Can this now be regarded as setting a precedent for all of them? Similarly, I would like to ask how training is evaluated and its cash value determined; what is the definition of voluntary work, and what sort of cash value could be worked out for it? And thirdly, can we in future also apply our own rules to sports events that are purely national and are not played or enjoyed anywhere else except in just the one Member State, or are we to await this precedent? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly hope that this is the case. That is why I will, of course, be asking for other sporting disciplines to participate in the tenth European Sports Forum, which will be given as much impetus as required, and to which Members of Parliament will also be invited, and where all sporting disciplines will be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have not discussed voluntary work as much as we should. We have discussed huge transfer sums, but not the hundreds of thousands of people who give their private lives and free time to work with young people and their sports clubs. That is what constitutes the social dimension of sport. How could sport in Europe exist without these people? You are quite right, Mrs Matikainen. I think that when we discuss information for young people in schools and clubs, we will also discuss the subject of voluntary work, because these activities are an integral part of the social dimension of sport in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Matikainen, with regard to the calculations, the sporting federations must agree on realistic sums. We shall never be in a position to evaluate voluntary work, because it would have to be paid, then sport would be out of the reach of villages and small towns and only professional sport would remain. That is not what we want. On my own behalf, therefore, and, I believe, on behalf of everyone here, I would like to say a big thank you to all voluntary workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
