<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Creation of European sugar-refining cartel with Community support</span></p>
<p class="contents">Article 81(1) of the Treaty prohibits cartels at European level, notably those having as their object the restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. However, as the Court of Auditors' special report No 20/2000, Paragraph 91, points out, there is no true common market in the sugar sector, and competition between the various sugar-refining enterprises does not exist. The suspicions raised by the Court of Auditors concerning the creation of an industry cartel with the endorsement of the European institutions are fully confirmed by the movements, or non-movements at international level, within the sugar and cane trade and by sugar prices on the European market. The Commission's ban on the sending of sugar consignments to the EU by refineries which do not have agreements with the European cartel amounts to a substantial reinforcement of this cartel's power.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission explain why its services responsible for competition have still not launched any kind of investigation – whether within the Commission or externally – into the European sugar cartel's long-standing and visible practices of dividing up the markets, price-fixing, and dumping on to territories where no controls apply? Does the Commission not consider its own failure to act to be clearly in breach of the Treaty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, the Commission would like to point out that, over almost 30 years, it has collected evidence for a number of cases relating to the sector and has imposed penalties for both cartels at European level and agreements at national level and abuses of dominant position. All these decisions were subject to the control of the Court of Justice, which confirmed that they were fully justified.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, a fresh inquiry was opened following a claim, but the investigation did not yield proof of the alleged facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The sugar sector has, moreover, been the subject of specific inquiries in the context of the Regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings. On the other hand, as Mr Casaca is aware, over a year ago, the Commission presented an initial reform of the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector. The objective of this reform was clearly to open the sector up further to competition. However, the European Parliament and the Council rejected the Commission’s proposals by a large majority. Nevertheless, the Commission published a call for tenders for the performance of an external study on competition in the sugar sector and on the impact of the common organisation of the market in sugar. The results of this study should be ready early in 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, we do not need studies, surveys or investigations. I would simply ask you to pick up the telephone and claim to be the owner of a supermarket in your country, telephone another Member State, such as France, Germany or the United Kingdom, and say that you want to buy sugar. Do this and see what answer you are given. You will be told that there is no sugar, because the market is completely sewn up by a cartel, with the blessing of the Commission, which fiercely defends this cartel whenever it is under attack, as in the Autonomous Region of the Azores. These are the facts. None of your justifications appeared in the report by the Court of Auditors when it stated the same thing and in fact the Commission said only that this situation was due to the nature of the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without claiming to be exhaustive, I should like to remind you that as early as the beginning of the 1970s the Commission adopted a decision penalising no less than sixteen companies for being in breach of Article 81 of the Treaty. In 1988 the Commission penalised British Sugar for abuse of a dominant position; in 1997 the Commission also penalised Irish Sugar for abuse of a dominant position. In 1998, the Commission penalised a price cartel on the British market in industrial sugar which had lasted for nearly four years. In 2001, a complaint was submitted to the Commission stating that sugar producers in one Member State had collectively refused to sell. Nevertheless, as I have just said, the investigation did not prove that there had been a coordinated refusal to sell. All of the parties have been informed that proceedings have been closed and the complaint has been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to recall that the Commission pays particular attention to these problems when monitoring concentrations. The Commission finds it regrettable that the European Parliament and the Council should – as I have just mentioned – have rejected the proposals it tabled more than a year ago by a large majority, proposals which specifically sought to introduce more competition in this market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the broadcasting of television programmes is concerned, the internal market does not exist. The difficulty is that the possibilities for the Commission are restricted. The sad fact remains that the directive I referred to earlier, which was adopted in 1993, does not give the Commission a sufficient legal basis for infringement proceedings which might have been available to the Commission if the legal situation had been different.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore it is not open to the Commission to start the infringement proceedings that I am sure Mr Perry would consider desirable. So all the Commission can do is carry out the study, which is nearing completion and will be submitted to Parliament as soon as it is ready – before the summer recess – so that Parliament can draw its own conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry is completely right in expressing his serious dissatisfaction with the state of affairs. The Commission lacks any legal basis for any infringement proceedings that Members of Parliament might want to undertake. It is an unsatisfactory situation and the Commission is looking into the problem. Its analysis will come before Parliament as soon as possible.

In its opinion of 10 April 2002 the committee confirmed the risks posed by growth-promoting hormones to consumers that it had identified in its earlier opinions. In particular the committee concluded in its 1999 opinion that for 17ß-oestradiol there was a substantial body of evidence that it has to be considered as a complete carcinogen and that it exerts both tumour-initiating and tumour-promoting effects. No safe threshold could be established for any of the six hormones evaluated, and prepubertal children are the group of greatest concern because of their extremely low levels of endogenous production of hormones.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also concluded in 1999 that the adverse effects included developmental, neurobiological, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. In saying that "no amendments to those opinions are justified", the scientists confirmed the validity of the previous opinions. New evidence was reported on the disposition of esters of 17ß-oestradiol and their accumulation in edible animal body fats.</p>
<p class="contents">This evidence needs to be considered in any exposure assessment as well as the consequences of the newly recognised, more complex metabolisms for synthetic hormones such as trenbolone, zeronol and melengestrol acetates. The possible adverse effects on human health of these residual metabolites require further assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, recent evidence was noted regarding possible adverse environmental effects. The Commission considers that its approach to consumer protection in this area is fully justified by scientific advice. The Commission shares the honourable Member's views concerning the importance of transparency and credibility, which is why the committee's opinions are immediately published on the website of the Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection, together with other relevant information on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was in this Parliament when the ban was introduced originally and I voted for a minority report that was proposed by Professor Tom Raftery, an expert on all these matters. He firmly believed that the motivation behind the proposal to ban these products was political. As a German Member of Parliament told me: "Professor Raftery is right, but there is a wave of hysteria in Germany so I must vote against him". I do not think that a wave of hysteria is sufficient grounds for legislation by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My understanding is that the Commission's position is not supported by the best scientific evidence from the United Nations, the United States, Canada, New Zealand or Australia. These people are not noted for putting the health of their own citizens at risk, and they too base their policies on what they regard as sound scientific advice.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask the Commission if it agrees with me that in the present climate, when the European Commission is being put into a position of banning so many products and processes – even research itself in some instances – it is extremely important that what we do is seen to be soundly based and reliable. To do anything else will undermine the long-term credibility of the European Commission. I believe that we are doing that in this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">However I have to say, at the risk of repeating myself, that the relevant scientific committee has looked at this now on three separate occasions. They have furnished their opinions on those occasions, most recently within the last couple of months when they took into account the earlier opinions but also all the relevant up-to-date scientific opinion on this particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">They have come to the conclusion that I have presented to you. I have to say that when I am engaged in the exercise of risk management, I have to follow the advice of the risk assessors, I have to follow the advice of scientific evidence and scientific opinion. If I fail to do that, or if any of us fails to do that, in my view we are completely lost. We are then at sea without a compass. That is why it is important for us to follow closely the advice that we are given. And I have to reiterate this is the advice that we have been given and that is why we have followed it closely on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">May I make one further point, while I am on my feet: We are at the moment bringing through legislation in relation to this issue which is in response to the opinion of the WTO some years ago where a particular infirmity was found with our position by the WTO. That related to only one issue, and that was essentially a procedural issue. That issue has now been addressed in the amending legislation that is before this House and no doubt it will be discussed by you, Mr McCartin, and indeed other Members when this piece of legislation comes before the House on second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following on from the dispute in the World Trade Organisation, the Commission has commissioned scientists to carry out sound work. Seventeen studies have been submitted, and it is now beyond scientific doubt that the mutagen 17-beta-ostradiol is genotoxic and carcinogenic. This is an argument in our dispute in the World Trade Organisation. I would ask Mr McCartin not to cast any doubt, not even among farmers. It is clear that the six hormones used in the United States are not as healthy as is claimed, and very much harm public health.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Illegal immigration to the EU from Morocco</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Association Agreement with Morocco includes among its areas for priority action the need for dialogue to deal with illegal immigration and the conditions of return and the need to reduce migratory pressure. The 'action plan for asylum and migration' for Morocco emphasises that Morocco's failure to require visas of emigrants crossing its territory facilitates the entry of illegal immigrants into the EU and makes returning them difficult since proofs cannot be supplied. On 18 September 2000, the General Affairs Council mandated the Commission to negotiate a general EU-Morocco agreement on the return of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission state what initiatives for dialogue are under way under the Association Agreement? Does it consider it possible to use financial cooperation with Morocco as a lever for ensuring compliance with Title VI of the Agreement? Does it believe that pressure can be put in the immediate future on Morocco to make visas compulsory for third-country nationals, as a means of preventing irregular entry into the EU? Can it provide information on the state of play as regards negotiation of the above-mentioned agreement on the return of immigrants? Can the Commission take steps to ensure that the Member States and the European Parliament are kept informed, now and in the future and on a regular basis, on the progress of the negotiations? </p>

I shall respond to them all.</p>
<p class="contents">On question 1, in the framework of the agreement the parties have established a working group on migration and social affairs. It has met twice so far and migration issues have been discussed in three categories: socio-economic development, support for legal migration and combating illegal migration. A series of informal thematic meetings on specific issues in these categories is anticipated this year and next year. In addition, a dialogue to prepare the MEDA-funded projects related to migration has been established.</p>
<p class="contents">On question 2, the Commission continually monitors the implementation of projects and programmes to ensure fulfilment of the said objectives. The dialogue on migration is making good progress and there are no indications that cooperation will not sustain progress in future. The Commission will of course take the satisfactory implementation of the association agreement into account when it decides on the allocation of future funds.</p>
<p class="contents">On question 3, the introduction of visas for third country nationals is a measure that the Moroccan authorities will need to consider. We can discuss that in the dialogue under the association agreement. If a visa system did help to curb the influx of illegal migrants through Morocco's southern and eastern borders the Commission could look favourably at supporting Moroccan initiatives for introducing such arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">On question 4, in September 2000 the Council approved negotiating directives for a Community re-admission agreement with Morocco. After several high-level meetings last year, the Moroccans eventually agreed to enter into an informal dialogue on re-admission. The Commission has suggested formal negotiations being launched before the end of next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on question 5, whenever the Commission is authorised or mandated by the Council to negotiate a Community re-admission agreement with a third country it conducts negotiations in accordance with the relevant directives and in full compliance with the procedures set down in Article 300 of the Treaty. That makes provision for Parliament to be comprehensively informed about, and consulted on, the final outcome of negotiations. In addition, of course, the Commission is manifestly ready to inform the relevant parliamentary committees whenever it is invited to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel, Commissioner, that Morocco must shoulder its responsibilities and these facts prove that it is not fulfilling its duties.

<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner whether what has been written in the press is true or whether the Commission’s idea is that this burden of proof should be divided equally among all European countries and that it should not always be the farming sector that foots the bill for the association agreement being negotiated with Morocco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true to say that development policies must be partly geared to trying to combat poverty to provide people with a workable, reasonable alternative to moving themselves and their families to other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that when the Community allocates funds for trying to combat poverty and provide the basis for sustainable development, those funds are fully and effectively spent. Upon examination, what the honourable Member will see is not any meanness or narrowness in the attitude taken to the MEDA programme. On the contrary, the attitude towards financing the MEDA programme has much more to do with a desire to ensure efficient, value-for-money spending with proper, generous effects for the people who should be the recipients of such development support, rather than simply having figures on a budget which can look impressive but have less impressive consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will answer them all, but it will unfortunately take a few minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question: firstly, in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Belgian Minister Mr Rik Dams and me on behalf of the Commission on 17 July 2001, it was anticipated that the negotiations on the Berlaymont should be concluded by the end of December 2001. However, on 14 December, I was informed by the minister that Belgium would not be ready to discuss financial questions until February because he was expecting the outcome of relevant audits. The audit reports eventually became available to him in March and intensive negotiations then started.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the positions of the Belgian Government and the Commission have become closer, but we have not yet reached final agreement on the price that the Commission would be willing to pay or on legal guarantees which are required by the Commission. Negotiations are therefore continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take questions 2 and 3 together. The Belgian authorities have confirmed that the current estimated costs of the basic renovated building are EUR 605 million and the Government has confirmed its intention to make the building fit for reoccupation by 31 December 2003. The history of this project means, however, that the Commission considers that certainty about the realistic hand-over date can only be established when a specific date has been fixed in a contract that will also make provision for financial penalties for late delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">Question 4: Before the Commission enters into a binding contract with the Belgian Government, we will naturally provide the budgetary authority with an analysis of the outcome of the negotiations held with the Belgian government. As I have indicated on several occasions, the Commission's negotiating position is based on an independent analysis of the total cost as well as on those costs that are due to the numerous delays encountered in the renovation project.</p>
<p class="contents">Question 5: I can confirm that throughout all the discussions and activities related to the Berlaymont question, the Commission has been motivated by the absolute need to ensure value for money in the use of Community funds. That will continue to be a major pre-condition for a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations with Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, question 6: The technical description of the building will be legally binding and there will be legal guarantees for the quality delivered. By these means, we will ensure that the final product satisfies high standards of quality.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards efficiency, the Commission has made it very clear that we are deeply dissatisfied with the fact that the original deadline was not respected and, even more importantly, that it has changed on numerous occasions. As I have said to Parliament and to the Belgian Government, I believe that many of the difficulties encountered in this project are due to serious management problems that originated with the management structure of Berlaymont 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EUR 605 million is what the negotiations are all about, so I am not yet in a position to be able to say to him whether that overall price is satisfactory to us, whether it meets the needs we have or what our eventual position following the conclusion of negotiations will be about that price.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the final decision in the College is concerned, that too is dependent on the satisfactory outcome of negotiations; and I have specified the fundamental considerations there. The price, if we are to reoccupy the Berlaymont, has to be satisfactory; the quality has to be acceptable; there have to be legal guarantees; and these are preconditions for our eventual reoccupation of the Berlaymont. Until those conditions are satisfied, I cannot specify a date for a final decision in the College. I hope that it will not be long delayed. It is in nobody's interest for the existing uncertainty to be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, then, virtually answered the first question as to whether we are absolutely committed to reoccupying the renovated building. It is our preference to do so for a large number of reasons, not least the fact that possession of the building in something like 27 years would give us a very valuable piece of real estate in an extremely intensively developed part of Brussels. We are also aware that the logistical convenience of the Commission would be served by being able to reoccupy that building, but we will not reoccupy under any conditions; and therefore it is crucial that if we are to consider, finally, reoccupation of the Berlaymont Building, we are confident that the requirements relating to price and value, which we have made very clear throughout, are satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the second point, I should like to take this opportunity of saying what I told the Bureau of Parliament earlier today, and I have said it to many parliamentarians: the package of proposed reforms of the Staff Regulations are now before Parliament and the Council. Everyone's interests would be served – in particular Parliament's interests – if it were possible for Parliament to arrive at its opinion this year, simply because that would then facilitate consideration of any revisions that Parliament proposed or any opinions that it presented. Consideration of those features could then take place properly in the early months of 2003. If we receive Parliament's opinion late, then that, obviously, would put pressure on the time available for the proper consideration of Parliament's opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first question, we believe that a properly equipped modern facility Berlaymont would, at the right price, be an appropriate home for the European Commission. There is no doubt about that. Certainly, with the additional pressures that are coming with an unprecedented enlargement, that emphasises the case. However desirable and however appropriate the Berlaymont is – and we have made that clear throughout – the acceptability of the Berlaymont is conditional upon the satisfaction of standards of quality and the negotiation and conclusion on a reasonable price. Until those conditions are satisfied, we cannot conclusively say that we would definitely go back into the Berlaymont, however desirable it may be in terms of location and facility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution supports our proposals and encourages us to implement and follow them up carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some of the concrete measures which will be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective is to incorporate tourism in Community policies and measures favouring an integrated approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to improve cooperation between tourism stakeholders, notably social partners, including an annual European Tourism Forum. We will organise this forum for the first time in December this year in Brussels. We want to promote stakeholder access to Community instruments, involving also local authorities and the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are mobilising existing survey, analysis, competence and support centres for the development of knowledge and observation regarding tourism. This has been a major request by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, we will look at Tourism Satellite Accounts to measure the economic impact of tourism, and on a European Agenda 21 for tourism to promote the sustainable development of tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need to strengthen the position and image of Europe as a diverse and attractive set of destinations. This was a major discussion point at the informal meeting of the tourism ministers, to which the honourable Member refers in his question.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures benefit all types of regions in Europe, also those with a peripheral location.</p>
<p class="contents">A considerable share of Structural Funds made available to the Member States supports tourism, both directly and indirectly. Less densely-populated, rural or peripheral regions can therefore make good use of the possibility offered in this context to create jobs and to generate economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">For the mainstream programmes which represent over 90 % of the financial envelope available in the Structural Funds, the Commission has set clear guidelines which explicitly encourage the support of a balanced and sustainable development of tourism, in particular through three activities:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the modernisation of tourism-related infrastructures and the improvement of their efficiency;</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, upgrading skills and professional profiles in order to respond better to the expectations of tourists and the needs of the industry;</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, encouraging business-to-business partnerships, public-private cooperation and networking in order to improve the integration of the different services involved in the “tourism chain”.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the diversification of activities in rural areas, there are also funds allocated in the framework of Rural Development Programmes by the European Agriculture Guarantee and Guidance Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures try to improve the attractiveness of the villages and rural areas, protecting nature and historical and cultural heritage. Tourism related measures are also financed with the Funds allocated to the Community Initiative LEADER+ improving the quality of life of the rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, tourism development should be carefully planned so as to take into consideration the carrying capacity of the site with regard to environmental, social and economic impacts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have three follow-up points in relation to what you have said.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to sustainable tourism, obviously tourism is best dealt with where you have human populations. Therefore maintaining people in rural areas and in peripheral areas of the European Union is a better way of encouraging more tourism to those areas. On that particular point, would a proposal with regard to the worldwide marketing of the European Union as a tourist destination be considered – not necessarily funded or put in place, but just considered?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, can we utilise already existing airline hubs to ensure that peripheral areas can be serviced into those areas as well? The European Commission has already given approval for marketing support to small regional airports because of their importance in creating tourism and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a necessity and an urgency with regard to ensuring that those people who make investments in the tourism product and the tourism area are given the necessary back-up marketing and structural supports from the European Union programmes, which are sometimes denied them because they have already made capital investments themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this were to be done as a project between the Member States, of course according to their choice, these kinds of peripheral, lesser-known but exciting areas would be better marketed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with you that in those areas where there is a rural population it is easier to guarantee sustainable development. If the marketing is well done there are a lot of tourists who will chose these types of destinations. But it is difficult for companies to reach rural populations. Concentrated Internet marketing would be the cheapest way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the investment issue, I should know more of the details of the fund which the Member is talking about. I am sure that we can come back to this issue later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are three parts to the question.</p>
<p class="contents">First part: How does the Commission intend to promote and organise migration from existing APIs to a single API?</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) includes a legal requirement for the Member States to promote transparency when it comes to making APIs available for application programs.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions do not include a requirement for any particular API technology or a single API. The standard for multimedia home platforms (or MHPs) fulfils the requirements for operational compatibility and transparency in this area. We are therefore encouraging industry to introduce this standard voluntarily. The MHP standard will be included in the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in accordance with the directive. The Member States are responsible for encouraging use of the standards included in the list. We anticipate the list’s being published this autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the directive, the Member States must also carry out a review of operational compatibility and user options before July 2004. The directive contains a procedure for making use of a standard compulsory. That is one of the issues which will be addressed in the proposed review.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the question is as follows: How does the Commission intend to organise the dialogue in connection with such a migration?</p>
<p class="contents">The Information Society Directorate-General has initiated a dialogue with industry on operational compatibility for interactive TV services. Operational compatibility has been set up as the most important objective, and standardisation is part of the solution. There is a lack of agreement within industry as to what operational compatibility actually involves. We have therefore taken measures to give some impetus to the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have asked the Digital Video Broadcasting (or DVB) Group to investigate the technical operational compatibility of interactive services. Secondly, we have begun an investigation of the strategic aspects of operational compatibility so as to have access to an independent analysis later this year. Consumer issues are among those covered by the analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have asked the standardisation body, CENELEC, to carry out a preliminary investigation of the standardisation of digital TV and interactive TV services. Their brief will be to analyse the present technical position and come up with recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The third part of the question concerns whether the Commission will restrict the dialogue exclusively to industry and have it cover only technical aspects. In fact, it is also willing to open the dialogue to consumer groups and Members of the European Parliament. I am very well disposed to participation by MEPs and consumer groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue must, however, have a stable technical basis, and that is what we are at present concentrating upon. The political debate must be preceded by careful investigations of issues such as operational compatibility. The decision makers must understand what alternatives there are and what the consequences of these would be. It is a process which shows that the Commission is following up the commitment it made in the December plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something on which we completely agree. I am also pleased that you indicated the timetable for publication of the standard. If, however, we look at developments in Europe and at the almost daily contributions to Finnish newspapers too, there is a prevailing uncertainty – even in Finland, as one of the countries to have signed a memorandum of understanding – as to whether the same standard will be used by cable, satellite and terrestrial operators.</p>
<p class="contents">The question, therefore, is: Does the Commissioner think that 2004 is adequate as a deadline? In fact, we are in something of a ‘chicken and egg’ situation where developments within digital TV are concerned. May I ask the Commissioner if the issue of digital TV is in some way to be touched upon again before Seville? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally believe that digital television will play a major role in the information society in the longer term because the Internet must also be available via television if we really want the whole population to use it.</p>
<p class="contents">In December, we decided that industry should be given a year in which to adapt, once the directive had entered into force, and we must keep to that commitment. I very much appreciate, however, that we perhaps must do more in the course of time to guarantee that everyone who participates in the process is aware that, if a solution does not come about on a voluntary basis, the Commission has a mandate to act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, it establishes that all the Commission’s proposals presented in the Annual Policy Strategy and later in the Work Programme will undergo a proportionate integrated impact assessment and that all departments will follow uniform minimum standards on consultation. Briefly, it aims at more transparent, efficient and cost-effective lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Such tools should significantly contribute to improving the quality and coherence of policy design by the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">A strong and solid knowledge base for policy making is crucial if the European institutions are to improve the regulatory environment. The challenge is to ensure a high level of protection for European citizens in sensitive areas such as the environment, health and consumer protection, while avoiding over-regulation, which damages growth and employment prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to meet our common objective of simplifying the Union’s legislative environment, in particular for European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), there is a need to increase interinstitutional cooperation, including cooperation on impact assessments by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been calling for this, proposing that a permanent interinstitutional mechanism be created to implement its Action Plan, in order to ensure the quality of legislation. In addition, during his presentation of the Better Regulation package to the Conference of Presidents at Parliament on 5 June, President Prodi renewed the appeal for an interinstitutional agreement on some of the proposed actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully, progress will soon be achieved. Encouraging discussions have already started between the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In formally adopting new tools for impact analysis and consultation, the Commission also wants to promote a new culture of transparency, participation and challenge. All parties concerned by its proposals will be invited to contribute with their views and expertise.</p>

<p class="contents">Experience suggests that the growth of transport, especially in border regions, will speed up as a result of enlargement. In the aim of dealing with the bottlenecks caused by this situation, the White Paper puts forward a policy designed to ensure a return to balance between the various forms of transport. It is appropriate that a considerable part of this growth in transport should take place in infrastructures other than roads, such as the railways, inland waterways or maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad aim of the Commission proposal revising the decision on the guidelines for the trans-European transport network is to reduce bottlenecks. In this context, the Commission has proposed adding a set of links to the applicant countries. In order to improve East-West corridors, it has also proposed two new priority projects, which are: the combined transport project, the high-speed Stuttgart-Vienna rail link and the project to improve the Danube between Vilshoffen and Straubin.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has proposed amending the Regulation laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks, increasing the upper limits for cofinancing, from the current 10% to 20%, of investment costs, in exceptional cases, including projects carried out at borders with candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to carry out a broader review of all the trans-European networks in 2004, bearing in mind the new shape of the European Union, in other words, the shape arising from enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the transport of goods by rail we have already presented, not only the first rail package that was adopted a year and a half ago, but also the second rail package that is intended, precisely, to boost the rail transport of goods, producing a railway fit for the twenty-first century, which is dynamic, competitive with roads, geared towards the customer and which, consequently, provides a high-quality service. I hope that the work in this Parliament and in the Council of Ministers will enable us soon to give the green light to these extremely important measures<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the field of logistics, thanks to the new Marco Polo project, designed to promote interoperability and to subsidise the development of alternatives to road transport, companies in the candidate countries will be able to obtain economic aid if they make their request for it in conjunction with a European Union company. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Wuermeling and I are generally concerned about this as, in the border regions from which we come, the increase in the volume of traffic is not merely between 40% and 50%, but in excess of that figure. People living along the main roads in border areas have to cope with traffic jams, noise and gas emissions. When they travel to work, they constantly do so trailing behind HGVs from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">As a supplementary question, I would like to ask, as you have mentioned that railways are to receive special support, whether, in the meantime, measures have been taken or supported to transfer freight from road to rail in border regions, and whether you have had discussions about this with the German railways.

In other words, even with the pre-accession funds, we are trying to ensure that the candidate countries do not dump their transport onto the roads and that they maintain a percentage at least equivalent to the current figure in the rail sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the problems, the trouble and the annoyance caused to communities living next to major road transport arteries and this is why we are looking at how we can improve the quality of this traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">We have spoken with Deutsche Bahn, of course, and, next year, the first railway package will enter into force, which will mean, first of all, that the European Union will have, for the first time, a European railway network, which does not currently exist, that we will be able to move beyond national railway networks and that we will integrate these national networks into a European network.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this European network, the various transport operators, Deutsche Bahn amongst others, will compete against one another, enjoying non-discriminatory access to it. I believe that with these systems, and then with the introduction in the coming years of common or at least interoperable technical standards, we will be able to build a genuine European rail network that can really compete with road transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will be aware, we are reforming our Rules of Procedure, a process in which I play a part as a shadow rapporteur, and people are getting very touchy about it all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking the Commission for committing itself to plugging the gaps between the trans-European transport network in the European Union and the TINA network in the candidate countries. That is very important. It has submitted proposals for completing the trans-European networks and has also made financial commitments in this connection. This is, in my view, a very good thing. In the regions we live in, individual infrastructure projects are now, of course, the subject of heated debate. The reason why I am putting this supplementary question is that we still do not have a more or less reliable indication of by what percentage freight traffic, in particular, is expected to increase. It would be very important for us to know that, as it would also be for the public, for whom new transport links bring disadvantages to be endured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the general forecast; it is clearly quite possible, however, that the rate will be greater in some areas. The basis for this is the latest extensions to have been made: for example, the Iberian Peninsula – in its road link with France through the Pyrenees, or the integration of the Scandinavian countries, in their road links with the rest of the continent, or Austria.</p>

<p class="contents">In its letter set out in Official Journal C 98 of 23 April 2002, the Commission addressed to Greece an ‘order to provide information on the implementation of Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) 659/1999<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>’.

<p class="contents">The Greek Government was notified of the decision and sent its comments on more than one occasion. The Commission’s decision was also published in the Official Journal, so that interested third parties could send their comments to the Commission within the space of one month. This deadline ended on 23 May 2002, the date on which the Commission received comments from the parties concerned. The Commission will take a final decision once it has studied in great detail the comments sent by the Greek authorities and by interested third parties who have made a formal representation on the matter.</p>

But one thing puzzles me. The question of the 1994 aid, which the Commission approved, is being reopened but, at the same time, the Commission has failed totally to react to comments made in the European Parliament by Members such as myself on the competition for the sale of Olympic Airways. What I should like to ask the Commission is this: first, who are the third interested parties? And secondly, is it the Commission's objective and is the Commission interested in the survival of Olympic Airways which, as we know, is vital to air travel in Greece? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission also wishes to enable economic development to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that Olympic Airways is an extremely important company for Greece’s economic activity and that it also has a marked affect on the economic activity of the European Union as a whole. Having said all of this, however, I must add that what we are talking about here – as I said before about 1994 and 1998 – is simply the way in which these decisions have been implemented, having been authorised at the time in line with the information that was available to us. We have, furthermore, requested confirmation and details from the Greek administration.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would most like to see, however, and I repeat, is for the Olympic affair to be resolved in a positive way, for all the initiatives and the work undertaken by the Greek authorities to privatise Olympic to reach a positive conclusion and simply not to see this type of information about further alleged aid from the Greek Government. I cannot tell you how much happier I would be if Olympic had no problems and if we were not having to look into this matter now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
