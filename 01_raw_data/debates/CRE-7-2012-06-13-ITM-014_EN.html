<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, good afternoon to you all.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a critical point in European integration: there will be an important European Council meeting in a few days, and there is the choice that the Greek people will make on Sunday … However, I certainly do not believe that this should be a time for pessimism or alarmism. It should be a time to be proactive, responsible and determined. The world is watching us and waiting to see what we do. That became apparent to me again, recently, on the other side of the Atlantic, in Canada and in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remind this world that is watching us and waiting to see what we do that not all of the world’s problems come from Europe. We should remember that the financial crisis was not born in Europe. It was born very much in the United States with all the consequences that continue to affect us. We must say to this world that is watching us: ‘You can be demanding, impatient, critical of Europe, but be fair and equitable. Be realistic and look at what we have been doing for the last two or three years to learn the lessons from these crises and to restore order to the economic, budgetary and political functioning of the European Union’.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, the time has come, ladies and gentlemen, to state our confidence, as I am doing to you, in our institutions and in our capacity to take the right decisions and to implement them, our confidence also in the capacity of Greece and the Greek people to retain their place and their role in the euro area and in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain and it is that we will not get out of these crises by the same route we went in. We are tackling this crisis of confidence, of the markets and, first and foremost, of our citizens, and we must assert our strategy for exiting the crisis and open up new prospects, in the short and in the medium term, for economic and political integration within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the problems and what do we need?</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that there can be no single currency without solidarity and without joint economic discipline. That is why we need renewed economic and monetary union. We have made progress. Mr Rehn has won the support and the commitment of the European Parliament</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the financial crisis and the vulnerability of the banks are at the root of the States’ budgetary problems and the euro crisis. That is why we need to go further and, in particular, construct the banking union mentioned by President Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether we are talking about supervision, the single rulebook, or resolution, we must go further than what has been proposed over recent months or what has been proposed just now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States will have to be proactive, consistent and ready to make an effort and choose truly European solutions. I am thinking, in particular, of the issue of deposit guarantees, which is currently being held up at second reading, due no doubt to a lack of ambition on the part of Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We now finally know that Europe must be built with its people, and not without them, with the true democratic legitimacy that you represent. That is why, further down the road, there must be strengthened political union, as Chancellor Merkel was saying recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the future of the internal market, which has been, for the last 60 years, the first stage, the first basis for European political integration. The role of the Commission is indeed to propose working for the Union as a whole, the EU 27, on the basis of the Community method, with only one single market including the financial services. This EU27, soon to be 28, is, might I remind you, our foremost asset in working towards recovering growth.</p>
<p class="contents">All current and future reforms are more likely to succeed if the big single market functions better. Neither Parliament nor the Commission has been surprised by all that has been said in this debate on growth over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">For two years, we, the Commission and Parliament, have worked together to put this strategy back on track with Europe 2020, the Monti report and then the reports by your fellow Members, Mr Grech, Ms Kalniete, Mr Correia de Campos and Mr Buşoi. Thanks to all these combined efforts, I was able to submit to you, on 13 April 2011, the Single Market Act, with a view to adding this potential for growth and confidence beyond the consolidation of public finances, to reconstructing the bases for growth from a better functioning of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">We had worked well together. The Commission finally produced the 12 priority measures of the Single Market Act, which are now in the legislative pipeline and we have even managed to come to an agreement between Parliament and the Council on one of them, namely, standardisation. I hope that, in a few days, we will come to an agreement on a second of the 12 key measures, this time relating to the European patent. European companies have been waiting for this for 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">What more should we do, ladies and gentlemen, as we have not yet achieved this return to growth? First, make what we have already decided within the framework of the internal market function properly. I shall call this the ‘quick wins’, a new growth in services.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go into detail about the importance of the service economy here on our European continent but services do account for 65% of GDP and 70% of total employment. They have been behind the creation of almost 11 million jobs over the last 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are positive results from the transposition of the Services Directive, we shall have to go further given the importance of this text for the daily functioning of our internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in the Commission, believe that we could find between + 0.8% and + 2.6% growth in the internal market if the Services Directive reached its full potential. That is precisely the objective of this partnership for new growth in services, which the Commission adopted some days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a more ambitious implementation of this directive, a peer review, through country-specific recommendations in the context of the European Semester that you have just mentioned and by adopting a stricter and more proactive policy towards breaches with the objective of zero tolerance of clear breaches of the Services Directive. Then there is the improvement of a tool that you support, as do I, that of points of single contact. That is the first act of this partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, better functioning on the ground of the single services market. How do we achieve this? By optimising synergies between the different instruments of the internal market: directives on services, professional qualifications and <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">We have carried out ‘performance tests’, as I already mentioned, to see how, in three sectors – construction, business services, which is recruiting at the moment, and tourism – the freedom to provide services could interact better with professional mobility, benefits and opportunities in <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are seeking to guarantee the benefits of the Consumer Rights Directive by combating any discrimination that affects the end users of the services on account of their nationality and/or their place of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is why I believe that we must be more ambitious and go beyond the Services Directive and the service economy. That is also the objective of this very practical text on the governance of the internal market, adopted by the Commission some days ago. This is not a technocratic concern. You can take my word for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is legislation which is not implemented useless, it often adversely affects the functioning of the internal market. It harms the principle of competition within the Union, it creates imbalances between countries, and it also deprives the citizens of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to ensure the proper implementation of all the single market texts. It is a subject on which you have worked a great deal, particularly Ms Kalniete, Mr Busuttil and Ms Bastos.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, therefore, has just adopted this communication for new and better governance by calling on the Member States, Parliament, the Council, the Commission and our own services to show that we can be more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall adopt three lines of approach in our work: firstly, targeted action in those sectors with strong growth potential, obviously the services and financial services of which I have just spoken, but also network industries: transport, energy, the digital market.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified key legislative measures for each of these sectors, and the Commission, with the Member States, is committed to redoubling its efforts to ensure that they are properly, quickly and correctly implemented, for example, with increased assistance for transposition and the use of peer review.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see quick results in these sectors, and we shall apply the zero tolerance principle in the event of any delays in the transposition of our legislation. If problems persist, we shall then deal with these breaches with the utmost speed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line of approach is to evaluate and monitor the scope of our efforts using the mechanism of the European Semester, spoken of by Mr Rehn. I do not think that this semester should only cover economic governance or budgetary surveillance. I think that, over the same financial year, it should cover efforts towards cohesion and competitiveness. We could then measure the performances of the Member States by means of benchmarks and naming and shaming, and where there are shortcomings, we will provide complementary measures and country-specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last line of approach, Mr President, is a single market at the service of companies and citizens: better regulation, better use of IT tools, the ‘Your Europe’ portal, better functioning of SOLVIT and, finally, promotion of single market centres in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now say a few concluding words on a subject that will involve us over the coming weeks – and I know that Mr Harbour, whom I thank, is very committed to it – which is the second stage of the Single Market Act, which we are drawing up for the end of the summer. The 20th anniversary of this single market should not be an occasion for nostalgia or melancholy, as I often say it is, but an opportunity to be proactive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to retain all the advantages of the initial version of the Single Market Act, the competitive social market economy. These four words are important. They are clearly reflected in the 12 levers of growth that we have chosen together. Twelve new proposals that will drive growth and employment, that will deal, in particular, with sectors where the single market does not operate correctly or completely – energy, transport, services – and which, finally, will ensure the social and territorial cohesion of which I have just spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we are going to work on and we should be careful to be clear about what we have already decided together and then also to open up public debate, as we shall do on the occasion of the Single Market - Together for New Growth week, which we shall organise together from 15 to 22 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the fundamental issues which, for us as the European Parliament, will be at the heart of the consultation on the various legislative proposals in connection with the Single Market Act II in the coming weeks, have been incorporated into this document with all the necessary consistency and clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the motion for a resolution also demonstrates that, although the internal market has been part of Europe for quite some time, it continues to have great potential and also growth potential for the European economies – up to 4% for 10 years according to the Commission. That is why I believe it is important that the European Commission makes it clear that the time for talking about the implementation of internal market legislation is over and that it is now time for action. It is important that the European Commission keeps on reminding all those Member States – I think one can safely say almost all of them – emphatically and repeatedly of their obligations and, if these obligations are not complied with, takes legal proceedings against those Member States by all possible means. The Member States contribute to the legislation through the European Council of Ministers. There are therefore no excuses for not implementing internal market legislation correctly and quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I was somewhat surprised when, this morning, the President of the Commission proposed that we conclude an interinstitutional agreement for the implementation of priority areas. I doubt that we need an additional agreement for the internal market. For this area, we chiefly need a European Commission that implements what the Member States have promised. Mr President, I believe that, to achieve this, we need a horizontal strategy, and the Commission has already started along this road with the first Single Market Act. I believe that we need good, credible impact assessments, we need to focus on priority areas and, Mr President, Commissioner, we need real control over implementation through improved single market governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of our great achievements that we can move freely in the European Union, that we can sell our goods throughout Europe, that we have a high degree of product safety, and that we can bring citizens together here in this House, and it is a delight that we are working on it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important, Mr Barnier, that you continue on the path you have embarked upon so as to ensure, together with us, that the positive aspects of the internal market are brought closer to citizens and that they recognise what they have gained from the European internal market. That is something that is missing, that citizens do not recognise, because we talk too much about problems and not enough about the achievements of the European Union. It is therefore also important that we concentrate more on what we have enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that we want to have and also need a social market economy – and I place particular emphasis on the word ‘social’ – so that workers and consumers recognise themselves in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to praise what Louis Grech highlighted in his report by adopting an holistic approach, which we need so that we can really see the internal market as a global concept and not as disconnected small actions that run alongside each other, and with which a philosophy of Europe is truly associated. It is really important to work on this together and we should continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market is good, but there is one thing we should not forget: it must be structured for the benefit of citizens and not just for the benefit of enterprises and the financial world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of you have confirmed this. If you have a debt, there are two things that are important. First, not spending more than you are earning and, second, looking for opportunities to earn more and generate income. The single market can help us with the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure a functioning single market and, to do that, we need courage and audacity. We need fewer stifling rules and a better functioning market in all Member States, on equal terms and with greater uniformity. Experience teaches us that the transposition of directives creates variation within the single market, as a result of which it is a lot more difficult to get a single market to work, especially for the benefit of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been arguing for years that we should base our single market legislation on regulations that would have the same effect in all Member States. I have not yet succeeded in that, but I ask you again to make sure that we base legislation for the improved functioning of our European economy on regulations which Member States will no longer be able to transpose in a protectionist fashion, which is indeed the very reason why a transnational economy is not functioning in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market must again become an example for the global economy: a market where money is earned, where social security is guaranteed and a market that will address many aspects that ensure prosperity and political stability. We need to ensure, Mr President, that we achieve a single market where entrepreneurs will again feel at home instead of fleeing Europe due to stifling rules and a market where European citizens will again be proud to buy European products.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that I still have ten seconds, so I will briefly mention ACTA. ACTA is dead because we have not given enough information to our citizens. However, our own European products are being counterfeited to the tune of EUR 1 billion. We have to ensure that entrepreneurs, and European workers too, feel at home again in the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen numerous benefits and new opportunities over this period, thanks to the legal measures which have been successively introduced to improve the way the single market works. The single market has proved to be particularly helpful during the last few years, when we have been fighting the crisis. The free flow of capital, goods and services and, above all, of people, has contributed significantly to improving the situation of the citizens in many of the Member States. Unfortunately, because of administrative and legislative problems, we still are not able to make full use of this tool’s potential. So I welcome the Commission’s assurance that it will continue to view the Single Market Act as one of its most important strategic political priorities, because all measures intended to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises help stimulate economic growth, which, in turn, brings tangible benefits to European consumers. For there are still a great many hindrances to the operation of these businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Worthy of note is the proposal to improve the function of the single market by means of IT tools which will make it much easier for the citizens to solve problems. Completing the single digital market this year is highly desirable. This also involves the call for the Member States to reduce administrative burdens by an additional 25% over three years and to modernise their public administrations. Full use should also be made of the current opportunities afforded by the Internet, such as online trade and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Action to improve the way the services sector works, by rapid and efficient implementation of the Services Directive, is of fundamental importance. The directive does, after all, concern services which generate as much as 45% of the EU’s GDP, and it helps create a steady increase in the number of these services. It is therefore a powerful weapon both in the fight against the crisis and for promoting the systematic economic growth of the Union. A particularly urgent matter here will be the elimination of legislation which creates discrimination, on the grounds of nationality, for example, and which still exists in some Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should certainly thank him for his efforts, but he falls into an error common amongst British Conservatives. Challenged to find even one good thing to say about the European Union, most British Conservatives will cite the single market. They seem to believe that it is a free trade area and they think that free trade is a good thing. But it is not a free trade area. It is a customs union and it is a bureaucratic nightmare of regulation and red tape. Years ago, Commissioner Verheugen estimated that the cost of EU regulation was around 6% of European GDP. Since then, it has got worse and this proposal today adds more burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to the House today with good news. It is possible to create growth and jobs and prosperity and investment and recovery in Europe but, to do so, we will need to do four things. First of all, we must cut taxes, secondly, we must have a bonfire of the regulations, thirdly, we must dismantle the reckless and failing experiment of monetary union and, finally, we must adopt a rational energy policy and abandon our lunatic obsession with the myth of global warming. I fear that we will do none of these things and we will condemn Europe to a third-world future of decline, poverty and unemployment.</p>

<p class="contents">In the case of ex-Commissioner Verheugen – and I accept, Mr Schwab, that he is no longer a Commissioner but frequently in the European institutions, people retain the title of President or Commissioner after they have finished exercising their duty – he quoted a figure of 6%. Former Commissioner Mandelson quoted a figure for the benefits of trade in the single market at 1.8%.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr Harbour, it is nearly 45 years since I left university but I can still work out that 6% is a great deal more than 1.8%. Thank you very much indeed for that. My answer would be that the single market is indeed a customs union, it is a <span class="italic">Zollverein</span> and it has an external barrier. You will recall that all the economic studies that have been done show that free trade areas are generally much more efficient than customs unions. If you wish to point out that it is, in fact, a customs union with the addition of massive and excessive regulation, I will be the last to disagree with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality is that the European Union is part of the problem, not the solution. Europhiles like Malcolm Harbour tell us that Britain’s future depends on membership of the European Union, that more than half of our trade is with the EU. These are disingenuous arguments. Eighty percent of UK trade is internal, with 50% of the rest being with the EU. That is only 10% of UK trade, for which we have had a deficit since the early 1970s. Yet the EU and its bureaucratic rules and regulations are draining the life out of small and medium enterprises. No wonder the Federation of Small Businesses said to prospective MEPs in the 2009 European election guide, please, no more EU regulations. Malcolm Harbour attended a dinner, as I did.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier, there are 4.5 million small businesses in the UK that account for 99% of all enterprise. That is almost 60% of private sector employment and almost 50% of private sector turnover. SMEs employ an estimated 13.8 million people and have an estimated combined annual turnover of GBP 1 500 billion. The EU has constantly negatively impacted on their ability to service the majority of their contracts, whilst making it easier for other EU countries to trade in the UK. No wonder eight out of ten people want a referendum on Britain’s membership of this corrupt and doomed mess. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases, we do have the legal instruments, but full use cannot be made of them because they are not being implemented by the Member States. An example of this is the Services Directive, which applies to services that account for 75% of the Union’s GDP. It’s potential is enormous. I think it is very important that the draft resolution refers to the transposition deficit, because I consider this to be the main problem when it comes to the incomplete functioning of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the European Commission has been working on this, and last week it adopted a package concerning implementation of the Services Directive, noting that over the next five to 10 years, implementation of the directive will generate an additional amount in the region of 1% of the GDP of the entire EU, and if the Member States are more committed to the process of transposition, this will rise to as much as 2.5% of GDP. The Member States must therefore be ambitious in their approach concerning implementation of the directive, but must also concentrate on identifying areas where progress could still be made. This means, for example, that they should make sure no prohibited requirements are, in fact, being applied and, where possible, should remove requirements which are subject to evaluation. I have referred to transposition of the Services Directive, but this also concerns other areas, such as public procurement, for example, on which we are currently working. I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken up this matter in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution is a call for economic growth, but, in my opinion, it is also an indication of the frustration which Parliament – and perhaps also the Commission – is experiencing vis-à-vis the effective completion of the single market. It would be deeply sad if, in the fifth year of this legislature, we were to find ourselves churning out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in the first year, amongst others, the fragmentation and inadequate application of rules; lack of proper transposition and information; potential of the digital market; the Citizens’ Charter and the lack of resolution on the top 20 concerns; services and professional qualifications, directives, consumer redress and SMEs’ incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we are discussing the potential of the single market, but citizens are tired of rhetoric and instead want to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for the European Union. Otherwise, for citizens, unless there is this realisation, this will become nothing more than a meaningless, tired buzzword. Time is running short and the continued unity and integration of the market are being seriously threatened. We are already feeling, unfortunately, the effects of protectionism in various ways.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time the Council came up with more coordinated, urgent specific solutions and decisions concerning the crisis created, after all, by the irresponsible behaviour of some banks. This Parliament and the Commission – especially Commissioner Barnier – have been making specific proposals and initiatives, yet we seem to move very slowly. Citizens cannot go on being disillusioned at one summit after another.</p>
<p class="contents">The relaunch of the economy and the single market will need the continued impetus and input and hopefully the leadership of the Commission, and the committed ownership by the Member States. However, and most importantly, it must be a market which is credible, well understood and trusted by citizens, providing Europeans with a realistic and holistic action growth plan in order to achieve a truly competitive, inclusive and social economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is exactly as Ms Gebhardt said: the internal market has brought the European idea, the European philosophy, to the fore, there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that, externally, the internal market is seen as a success. However, if we look inside the European internal market, we will discover that some have benefited more than others. Germany has a very healthy balance sheet. The German <span class="italic">Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau</span> has calculated that, in Germany alone, the internal market effect represents an annual amount of EUR 30 billion in relation to the euro. On the other hand, we see that productivity in the peripheral countries is declining. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the Single Market Act II and these 20 years of the internal market as an opportunity to consider how we can get to grips with this imbalanced development, these current account differences, within the European Union. If we do not succeed in this, unless everyone sees an advantage in the internal market, the internal market will lose credibility and legitimacy in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to thank everybody on the committee for their deep engagement and knowledge about this subject. I think the resolution that we produced in response to this and marking out the road for the next phase of the Single Market Act is really important, and I hope the House will pass that with a very substantial majority tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the key aspect of the package that we have in front of us today is that it is a very realistic and practical approach. I quote from what you said, Commissioner, in your governance proposal: ‘we have to make what we have work better’. This is not about bold new legislative solutions and, as a number of my colleagues have said, we have had enough of those. We need to get down to delivering the benefits of what we have already worked on.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us here, particularly Ms Gebhardt, myself and Mr Schwab, worked on the Services Directive. We have been worried that it has not been transposed quickly enough, and we are pleased now that you are now going to put some real pressure on the Member States to ensure that those rights are properly delivered. That is not just about business; it is about consumers, as a number of you have said.</p>
<p class="contents">However, perhaps the most scandalous aspect of the Single Market at the moment is that, when citizens use the online tools they have on the Internet, they cannot actually buy services cross-border. They cannot buy goods cross-border in many cases because they are refused access to other websites and, in some cases, they are even offered different prices for the same service, depending on where they are making their enquiry. These things are absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will just close with this point. You said quite rightly, Commissioner, that the whole single market package must be subject to the deepest level of so-called smarter regulation – better policy making. This is not just true for the Single Market; it is true for everything we are doing in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those that have to fight harder every day to keep their jobs, the ever growing number of people who have to do two jobs in order even to survive? This resolution provides no answers in this respect.

I am thinking, for example, of the Single Market Forum held in Kraków, at which the participants adopted the Kraków Declaration. We have achieved a great deal since then, and a great deal has happened in areas about which both citizens and business people made known their expectations, such as public procurements and the recognition of professional qualifications – the Commission’s proposals on recognition are already being worked on in Parliament. We are currently also working on the out-of-court settlement of complaints brought by consumers about purchases made online. Work on roaming, which was also one of the main problems – particularly for young people – has been completed successfully, and many other examples could be mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We face challenges – very serious challenges – such as postal services, for example. There is no rational reason why cross-border postal services are still so extremely expensive. They are a hindrance to the development of electronic trade, which means they are slowing the growth of the European economy. Communication with the citizens is a total failure, and it is essential that we improve the way public consultations are conducted – no progress has been made on this for years. We have now reached 20 years of the single market, and we are holding a Single Market Week. I hope this will prove to be a good opportunity and that good use will be made of it to listen to the citizens and to set, in partnership with them, the priorities of our work.

The first example concerns what drivers are obliged to carry with them. We have open borders and we drive our cars across all the countries of the European Union, but we find that all the countries have widely differing requirements as to what we must carry with us. In some countries, you have to carry a set of spare bulbs, in others a high-visibility jacket, in a third country perhaps mud flaps or a respiratory mask, and now breathalysers too. Failure to comply with these obligations has severe penalties. It is time this was harmonised, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to take the initiative for standardisation in this area; I would also ask you to immediately restrict it to a high-visibility jacket, a warning triangle and a first aid kit. That ought to be enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example concerns the registration of motor vehicles that have already been registered in one country and are then transferred to another country. The motorist finds that he has to go through the whole registration procedure again. That means a whole load of bureaucracy and annoyance, and a whole load of new costs. I call on you to implement swiftly the regulation that has already been sent out, so that in future, once a vehicle has been registered once, it is registered throughout the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of few factors which are acting to stimulate the European economy. Since the European Commission says the main factor harming the economy is the weak and late transposition and incorrect implementation and application of EU standards concerning the single market, we are right to ask about the present attitude of the Member States and the destructive effect of what they are doing. We are increasingly seeing a return to national rhetoric and to blaming others for our economic problems. It has to be asked if this is a good route to take?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is not. The recipe for the current crisis is more Europe, not less Europe. Lifting existing barriers to the European market is certain to help stimulate our economy. To achieve this, the will of the Member States is needed. Instead of this, we are increasingly hearing things being said about social dumping, people who are taking away our jobs and the need to limit the free flow of people and goods. We have to ask where this will end? In view of changes in the world economy, a return to closed national economies will definitely not help improve the situation – quite the opposite. The Commission, therefore, should monitor all violations of the single market’s rules, but should also continue to put forward new measures which will facilitate the Member States’ implementation of existing legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was rightly said that today’s situation in the single market is very beneficial for some Member States due to certain restrictions, while for other Member States it is really damaging. I truly support and welcome your idea that common rules need to be established in the single market as a matter of urgency. As for the second issue, namely, the introduction of public procurement, I would propose introducing public procurement as quickly as possible so that it is possible to strengthen competitive conditions in our domestic single market, and to also use European Union money more effectively. The other issue is that we have to begin to think about defending the single market from third countries, particularly those that do not allow our individual companies to compete on a level playing field in their countries, because we are thus reducing the number of jobs in our own countries and reducing people’s incomes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once placed in direct competition, economies with very different development levels inevitably diverge, unless there are mechanisms for protecting and safeguarding the weaker economies. The stronger economies are increasingly dominating the weaker ones: that has been the story of this integration process. Take a serious look at this and you will see some of the true causes of several peripheral countries’ debt levels. Now they want to deepen the single market and they want to do so by simultaneously cutting the EU budget and cohesion funding – the very instrument that could help to overcome some of the existing inequalities – because of pressure from the very countries benefiting most from the single market. There can only be one outcome: more divergence and more inequality between Member States; in other words, cohesion will increasingly and solely be a dead letter in the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the enduring stagnation, however, I think that we should vigorously continue to implement certain administrative measures that would not cost much to implement but that would bring significant economic benefits. In particular, we should finalise legislation introducing a European patent as soon as possible. A single patent protecting innovative products across the EU should be the absolute minimum. I also believe that we should agree and implement common, simple rules for conducting business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, that would open up for them a realistic route to cross-border business. This means introducing unified, simple and transparent rules for accounting and reporting their incomes and expenditures. It also means implementing transparent and analogous means of certification and obtaining authorisation to trade that are also available to small businesses.

<p class="contents">All Member States must adopt and make decisions that favour growth, especially for the younger population, eliminating bureaucratic obstacles. There is a lack of leadership to invigorate the single market, which is an excellent tool, even more so during times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need to change tack, however. There is a need to return to the social market economy. Commissioner Barnier, your proposal for banking regulation is welcome yet incomplete. We know that banks are necessary, but they are a risk to an economy’s stability. They benefit from what is known as implicit guarantee.</p>

<p class="contents">Andreas Schwab, earlier, Ms Handzlik, Ms Le Grip, Louis Grech have expressed our common concern, not by way of making further speeches – this is Andreas Schwab who said this – but by way of taking action. This is the meaning of these two operational documents, ‘Services’ and ‘Governance of the Internal Market’, that the Commission is implementing, particularly to reduce the time periods of infringement proceedings – currently 25 months – to 18 months and, if possible, further still. You can rest assured – this is the meaning of these statements – that the Commission is doing and will do its work.</p>
<p class="contents">We will put in place this partnership, in particular, with this idea of a practical guide for citizens and businesses. However, if the partnership is not respected, if it is broken, then that will not be tolerated. There will be zero tolerance. This is also why it is important to integrate this governance into the European Semester, and to assure ourselves that there is no discrimination based on nationality or on place of residence – I say this to Malcolm Harbour. I have also noted, in relation to these different regulations, what Mr Pirker said and I will speak about this with Mr Kallas with regard to road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Evelyne Gebhardt and Mr Correia de Campos stressed an element with which I agree, which is that of the social market economy: the human aspects and also the presentation of positive points that must be implemented within the framework of the large single market, which is a shared collective area of economic and social life. Mr Correia de Campos, we are carrying out and we will carry out the social impact studies to which we are committed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the overall approach that Louis Grech had, the very first one recommended, must remain our approach. I say to Ms Vergnaud that if she still finds imbalances, which I can understand, in the Single Market Act, there is this second stage that we are preparing, which you will comment on and where we will be able to reach a better balance on any subject affecting consumers and citizens. In any case, I welcome your suggestions towards constructive preparation for the second stage of the 12 new proposals that the Commission will present in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Manders, Mr Bielan, Ms Sinclaire and Mr Kelly mentioned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). I have said to you – and I truly promise you that I am committed to this aim on a daily basis – that the large single market must be reconciled with citizens and with small and medium-sized enterprises, who have felt that the large market was not for them. Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at patents, the simplification of public markets, accounting standards, digitisation, Mr Kelly, in markets, or EU authentification, the measures that we are taking in banking – with lighter regulatory measures for SMEs – and company law that we spoke about earlier, an angle, a tailored approach clearly exists for encouraging investment and the work of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Róża Thun mentioned different services which are not covered by the Services Directive. As I speak, 85% of services are not covered by a European text. The Services Directive is undoubtedly the main instrument – it is not the only one – for improving the performance of the services economy on the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also say to Ms Irigoyen Pérez, who has just spoken, that I do indeed intend to make a number of concrete proposals this year for the protection of consumers, particularly in financial services, in respect of transparency of bank charges and access to basic accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words to conclude. We are preparing this great week of public debates, from 15 to 22 October, for new sustainable growth, Mr Cofferati. It is the spirit of Kraków that will continue to flourish. For this reason, I would therefore like to thank you and to thank the Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), Malcolm Harbour, for the support that you provide for all these initiatives, support which is objective and attentive, but also very constructive, helping us to enable the internal market to function better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elimination of existing barriers to the functioning of the internal market would not only result in savings for public finances, but would also give a boost to economic growth. The majority of measures aimed at completing the internal market does not require major investments, merely political will and a competent executive apparatus. The economic benefit of such measures, however, can be measured in billions of euro, given that they foster mobility within the European Union, facilitate cross-border service provision, promote small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to funding, encourage innovation and, ultimately, lead to job creation. The ideal functioning of the single market presupposes that European citizens – who have the right, by operation of law, to freely travel, take employment and settle down within the European Union – do not suffer discrimination while exercising these rights. It is the responsibility of Member State governments and European institutions to ensure that citizens are fully aware of their rights and obligations, and can make use of the available options for legal remedy, if necessary. We must guarantee EU citizens working in other Member States the same fundamental social rights as citizens employed in their home countries. The freedom to provide services and the freedom to pursue economic activities must go hand in hand with guaranteed social security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important aspect of completing the single market, the Services Directive, was adopted in 2006 and was supposed to be fully in place by the end of 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission’s assessment, full implementation of the Services Directive would increase EU GDP by 2.6% and, in some of the countries most affected by the crisis, national GDP could increase by up to 2.2%. I do believe that such an increase would be highly desirable in order to overcome current problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing fully the single market and Services Directive would not only boost the economy and increase GDP, but would also mean considerable savings on administrative burdens and bureaucracy, amounting to up to EUR 40 billion. New fiscal discipline rules will be instrumental in ensuring fiscal stability in the future, but we also need to force Member States to finally and unconditionally implement the Services Directive and by that to complete the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Launching infringement procedures should be routine when handling cases where whatever EU legislation is not implemented in the foreseen time and form. As the average infringement procedure takes up to 25.5 months, I would urge the EC to speed up their processing in order to ensure a real effect in due time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, however, it should be strengthened in a balanced way. The single market cannot be judged in isolation from other policy areas, in particular, the social area, consumer protection and employment rights. We want an internal market which is fair and which benefits not only European businesses – particularly small and medium-sized ones – but, above all, the core of the market – the citizens themselves. We often hear that it is essential to involve citizens more in the development of the single market. How can we achieve this effectively? In my view, an effective information process can play a key role. This starts with public consultations, when legislation is under preparation. It is essential for consultations to be accessible in all official languages, and for them to be made more accessible and intelligible. The overall process continues by maximising the awareness of consumers when choosing goods and services, when they must have certainty that the legal framework rules out any concept of second-class consumers. Last but not least, consumers must be informed about their rights and how to enforce them, for example, through a functional alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system. I would like to end by joining the call for consistent transposition of the regulations. Insufficient and tardy implementation in national law and insufficient enforcement of regulations prevents a full exploitation of the benefits of the single market. Far from all transpositions are successful. My own country, the Czech Republic, despite some progress, does worst of all in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
