Mr Patten, you are well acquainted with this region. Next week the IOC will decide which country is to host the 2008 Olympic Games. The People's Republic of China, which is currently seeking political recognition on all fronts, would appear to be the most likely candidate. Anyone who thinks that Beijing does not stand a chance after failing in its bid in 2000 and 2004, has not thought hard enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Politics in China have nothing in common with the spirit of the Olympic Games. Human rights are trampled underfoot and freedom of expression and the freedom to demonstrate are countered with aggression. Tibet has been occupied for over 50 years. Minorities such as the Uighurs and Mongolians are prevented from exercising their rights and are losing their cultural identity. Fair hearings are denied. The death penalty, which we have just debated, is handed out and is often carried out in public as a deterrent.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport cannot be divorced from politics. Berlin in 1936 showed how the rally of the <span class="italic">Jugend der Welt</span>, with 100,000 spectators and a million people sitting in front of their radios and televisions, was subverted to the cause of propaganda. The people's joy was genuine, the organisation was perfect, but this positive image was hijacked by the nazi regime in order to win recognition for the dictatorship. The reaction to the boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow following the march of the Red Army on Afghanistan varied widely – and rightly so. There was one common understanding, however. Whenever international law is violated, it cannot just be business as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of China, our complaint in the PPE-DE Group is that for decades they have been destroying forests, polluting rivers and failing to control emissions to the point at which the whole ecosystem is on the brink of collapse. Animal rights protestors are rightly horrified by the level of cruelty, which hardly anyone has been able to gauge fully. Seven thousand bears are locked in harrowingly narrow cages in China and gall is constantly extracted from them, while they are still alive, in order to manufacture cosmetics and medicines. For that there can be no excuse.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore a plethora of arguments as to why China should not host the Olympic Games. Does anyone in this House really believe that anything will change in the next seven years? The People's Republic of China is free to make a new bid and it will be a worthy host of the Olympic Games if it puts the right conditions in place, by ending human rights violations and paving the way for democracy and the rule of law. Only once China has become a member of our community of values can the IOC say yes to such a bid next week or in the future in good conscience.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is about twelve years ago that on Tienanmen Square, the student protest and the call for democracy was quashed in a bloody fashion. During that time, Commissioner Patten was very active in Hong Kong in another role, and well known for his commitment to human rights. One could claim that ever since that period, in fact, the conservative trend in China has dominated, to the detriment of reformers, and that China is, in fact, still looking for a way out of the impasse in which it eventually ended up. Historically speaking, one could say that those two trends are still present, of course, but over the past couple of years, a decision has been made to occupy the political centre very firmly via a central role of the Communist Party – a very classical, old-fashioned role, in fact – and to open up the economy in a powerful manner. This creates enormous tension between the two trends, of course, which leads to enormous inequality in the country. It is clear that China cannot continue in this vein.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, and my group shares that view, we need a dual strategy: one of commitment, cooperation, talks and political involvement, for ultimately, they will need to take fresh steps at that Congress in 2002, which for them is a stepping stone towards a new generation. They too will eventually need to adopt a different position in such a huge world nation which has the pretension of occupying a place on the world stage of the future and of playing a role there as well. In the spirit of the Olympic Games, however, and given our position and values in Europe in terms of human rights, we cannot possibly support China’s application today. That is why we, as a group, are also critical of China and support the criticism levelled at China. I believe that commitment also means talking in clear and open terms. That is why we are here: to talk openly. That is why our group supports this resolution. China is not the kingdom of darkness, but in terms of human rights, a great deal needs to be done before that country can qualify for the application to host the Olympic Games. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Olympic Games are an opportunity for men and women from all around the world to come together to compete on equal terms, in a spirit of peace and cooperation between nations. That is the theory, despite the fact that a large number of participating countries are brutal dictatorships which hold both democracy and human rights in contempt. The Olympic Committee has a responsibility to promote the values which lie behind the Olympic Games. We in the ELDR Group have demanded that the International Olympic Committee set up guidelines for the countries which are to organise the Olympic Games, guidelines which include respect for human rights and democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the hottest tips for the Olympic Games is Beijing. Beijing is the capital of one of the world’s most hardline dictatorships. Persecution of those with opposing views, torture, censorship of the media and the Internet and more executions than all other countries put together are just a few examples of the way the Chinese regime tries to keep its population in check. The occupation of Tibet and the oppression of its people continue, and religious minorities are not allowed to practise their religion. For two years, there has been a systematic persecution of followers of the Falun Gong movement, with tens of thousands of followers being arrested and tortured, in some cases to death. In recent days, 15 women in a Chinese labour camp were tortured to death, with the authorities saying that it was suicide.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who want Beijing to host the Olympic Games say that sport and politics should not be mixed. However, that is exactly what the Chinese regime will do. If Beijing were to host the Olympic Games, the propaganda value for the Chinese regime would be enormous, and it would reduce the pressure on the country to change its policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In a report on Beijing’s candidature for the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee writes the following: ‘The overall presence of strong governmental control and support is healthy and should improve operational efficiency of the Games organisation.’ Calling the oppression ‘healthy’ is hair-raising.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights activists of all kinds are united in their demand not to let China organise the Olympic Games. A decision in favour of the Olympic Games in China is a breach of the whole Olympic ethos. The ELDR Group would therefore like to appeal to all members of the International Olympic Committee to vote against Beijing on Friday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we accept China's application to host the Olympic Games today, it would be like gilding the executions, the persecution of all political dissidents, the material and environmental destruction and the deportations which take place in China with the fine colours of the Olympic rings and all the flags. The result would certainly not be a reduction in these incidents; quite the contrary: it is more likely that the show of indifference on the part of the international community would encourage them. This does not, of course, mean that we are happy with this situation. We hope that the day will come when we will have the chance to be pleased, or rather to be enthusiastic about celebrating the Olympic Games in China, but that day has not yet come; it is still a long way in the future and we must be consistent in our actions. Considering what my colleagues have said I feel that I can stop here, for this is another of those issues on which the whole of Parliament is in agreement. I hope that our opinion will carry some weight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lucio Manisco reminded us just now of the traffic in organs, and I remember we had to fight very hard in this Parliament to get that resolution through. We were literally taken for madmen, for people who were inventing things. Today, the direct evidence of doctors who participated in the operations is in all the papers, and nobody can deny the evidence any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can anybody deny the evidence of the executions, obviously, or the semantic changes: China now conjugates the verb ‘to commit suicide’ as a transitive verb. Fifteen girls have committed suicide in the last few days in China, and hundreds of Falun Gong militants have committed suicide in the last few weeks and months. Nothing has changed in Tibet, and for the information of everyone hoping the year 2002 will see a new leadership in China, the favourite to succeed is none other than the former Chinese governor of Tibet, notorious for his policies of destruction and systematic incarceration.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased to hear what Mr van den Berg and Thomas Mann had to say, and I think there are more than enough indications for it to be considered at least inappropriate, and I do say inappropriate, for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing. Obviously, we all hope that it will rapidly become appropriate, and not just appropriate, but welcome, to hold the Olympic Games in Beijing, but there is still a long way to go, and I think, Commissioner Patten, that is also a result of this policy of critical dialogue which is increasingly becoming a policy of active complicity with the Beijing regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not the case in China. The human rights situation has not improved since the start of the political dialogue with the European Union. Quite the contrary, in fact. The regime’s repression of political opponents carries on undiminished. Dissidents often disappear behind bars for a ridiculously long period of time. On a large scale, offenders are given the death penalty after a very brief trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese leaders are extremely frightened of the peaceful, religious movement, Falun Gong. Followers of this movement are arrested, tortured, admitted to psychiatric hospitals or executed at random. Recently, another 15 women were tortured to death in a labour camp. Tibet is being systematically stripped of its own character.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental and animal welfare situation is atrocious. It is extremely naive to assume that large, international sports events and politics can be kept separate. The history of the modern Olympic Games shows very clearly how the sports festival can be used to enhance the glory of a political regime. The global media attention will only exacerbate this potential. Especially states which could do with a complete make-over of their international reputation will seize the opportunity of setting a new Olympic record in exploiting this event politically.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese population will derive little pleasure from the Games. The Games cost approximately USD 20 billion, and part of Beijing will need to be flattened and the inhabitants driven out of the city.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic ties between China and the world will also mean that liberal values and standards could enter the country. That is why there is hope. More welfare will ultimately lead to more political freedom. The Chinese are a patient people. In order to organise the Games, they have to practice patience and ensure that China has something to celebrate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could accept most of the points made by Thomas Mann and others. I have voted and shall continue to vote in favour of all the resolutions tabled here on issues of human rights, religious persecution or on the Tibetan situation in China. I feel, however, that this resolution is on the wrong track, because I am convinced that choosing Beijing as the venue for the Olympic Games will serve to support the reformist forces and that holding the Olympic Games could be a catalyst for major change. I feel certain of this. No one can accuse me of complicity and I shall continue to defend human rights in this House. I am certainly not a propagandist for the Chinese government. It would be a mistake to isolate China and we must continue to level criticism at China in this House and in the appropriate international forums. We cannot isolate a nation-state of 1.3 billion people. I was against Chinese isolationism decades ago, when even the Chinese authorities wanted it and I am also against us attempting such a move. Incidentally, the Cuban situation is a telling example of what can happen: the United States have maintained a stubborn embargo against Cuba for years. They have achieved nothing and we see that the North American embargo is actually proving to be the main political prop shoring up Fidel Castro’s dictatorship in Cuba. This is, therefore, the reason for my vote and the reason why my group does not support this resolution, because we feel that it is the wrong way to support progress on reform in China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have some knowledge of the way the International Olympic Committee does its work. I appeared in front of it in 1990 in support of the magnificent bid by Manchester to host the Olympic games. It was one of the examples in my life of tilting at windmills, but I know a little about how the IOC works. The European Union, as a whole and the Commission do not take a position on whether the games should be held in China or elsewhere. The decision is one for the International Olympic Committee, though I understand why honourable Members have such strong views on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have to explain to Parliament that I share the concerns which have been expressed about the human rights situation in China – and I will return to that in a moment. Just as I have always been doubtful about mixing the pursuit of trade objectives and the pursuit of human rights objectives, however, so I have doubts about mixing up sport and human rights. My worry on both scores is that very often you do not achieve your objective, you simply muddle your objectives. When I was the Governor of Hong Kong, much involved in the debate and the argument about human rights and democratisation, I still every year went to Washington to plead for China to have most-favoured-nation status and I certainly did not criticise the earlier bid by China to host the Olympic games.</p>
<p class="contents">I concede that at the margins, it can be helpful occasionally to take measures in regard to sport. For example, one could not argue that taking those measures in relation to South Africa during the years of apartheid was anything other than helpful, largely because of the emphasis which the white community in South Africa placed on sporting links.</p>
<p class="contents">If you take the issue of the Olympics, while I accept that there are some horrendous examples of the Olympic spirit being abused – and one speaker mentioned the 1936 Olympics in which my late father-in-law ran – one should also take account of the Olympic Games in Seoul. You would not find many democrats in Seoul who argued that holding the Olympic Games there had set back the pursuit of democracy and human rights, rather the reverse, so the argument is perhaps a little more complex than some honourable Members suggested. While these are matters of rather subjective judgment, when I argue this case, I am not doing so out of – to borrow a phrase from the honourable Member – supine complicity. I am doing so out of moderate, but not complete, conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">If Beijing is selected to host the games, it will require certainly both welcome and necessary steps on the part of the Chinese authorities if they are to have any chance at all of matching the outstanding performance as host, of Sydney last year. For example, it would be inconceivable that a country hosting the Olympics would or could prevent both its citizens and its visitors from having access to the news on the Internet about the games themselves. On a visit I paid to China a few weeks ago, an extremely interesting visit, it was curious that both the BBC and CNN Website were inaccessible. I do not think that would be possible at the time of an Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken on many occasions to this Parliament about the European Union/China human rights dialogue. I accept what the honourable Member said, that we have to be very careful that the dialogue actually produces some progress and it does not turn into, as he said, an act of complicity with the abuse of human rights. Our dialogue with China is undoubtedly the most complex and multi-faceted dialogue on human rights which we have with any country, as befits discussions with a country in which so many abuses continue, alas, to occur.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is constantly seeking to work with China to make it more effective and to have more tangible impact on the human rights situation on the ground. We are encouraging and supporting China in early ratification and implementation of the UN covenants and we continue to urge cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for human rights. We welcome the Memorandum of Understanding, which China has signed with Mary Robinson, but we hope that they will now implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this dialogue, we will continue to press for action in the areas of most concern to us, such as the repression of political dissidents, the suppression of religious freedom, the appalling and excessive use of the death penalty under the strike-hard campaign, the treatment of ethnic minorities, including those in Tibet, and the arbitrary detention conditions. I also raised during my last visit to China, the reports of torture and ill-treatment of the followers of the Falun Gong movement and there are other issues which we must address. There is increasing concern about the abuse of psychiatry in dealing with dissidents and members of religious groups in China.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend to the House's attention an article written recently in the <span class="italic">Asian Wall Street Journal</span>, which summarised the academic research of Robin Monroe, a very distinguished China-watcher, the author of probably the best book on Tiananmen, <span class="italic">Black Hands of Beijing</span>. I recommend it to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Parliament's concerns for the environment in Beijing and in China more widely and for the effects which preparation for the games could have on the city. During my visit in May, I met some of the handful of genuine Chinese non-governmental organisations working on environmental issues. I was left with the strong impression that China will find it impossible to meet the objectives it has set itself for environmental protection without the assistance of a civil society, which has mobilised itself voluntarily. A relaxation of the rules governing the establishment and operation of genuine grassroots NGOs is essential, so as to harness the energy and commitment of a population of over a billion. The same is true for any country or city which hosts the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">Sydney's success derived from the whole-hearted commitment of its citizens to hosting the games and making them a success in the eyes of the world. Any country which hosts the Olympic Games will have a problem if it does not enlist the support of its citizens. I do not believe that I am being naive. I know the appalling problems that exist, but it seems to me at the very least inconceivable that any country like China, although there is no country really like China, but any country with the sort of authoritarian repressive government that China has, would find it impossible to host the Olympic Games without that having a considerable impact on the development of civil society within that country.</p>
