We have now got through a development round the core task of which is to bring about the right changes to internal imports into Europe. Although imports are, in principle, a very important and very good way to supporting development aid, we must not, on the other hand, overlook the need for our own small and medium-sized enterprises to be encouraged in their turn to export their products. The euro/US dollar parity and China’s present growth potential in excess of 8% per annum must prompt us to consider how we are to maintain our trade balance in future. To do that, we do, of course, have to be capable of competing on global markets. I believe it is a good thing, and that it will in future be important, that Europe should take on a certain leadership role in this area, that we should use regular conferences within Europe as a means of affirming our commitment to this and, as soon as possible, come up with feasible strategies and objectives, with a definite timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">A single multilateral legal framework is, of course, of particular interest to Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ in any case two-thirds of our workers. We are not interested in a complex international structure that only large conglomerates and their lawyers can cope with. The developing countries are not alone in needing clear and simple structures that will, in future, bring willingness to perform, the consequent access to prosperity and, finally, peace. Here too, we need to distinguish between equity based on distribution and that based upon what people contribute, and we should keep both these aspects in mind. Opening up our markets does, though, bring problems with it, for we must remain capable of competing internationally in the future. It is for this reason that Parliament must deal with this topic not merely in general terms; instead, this parliamentary assembly should, in future, put the emphasis on Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy remarked that we were, so to speak, passing from the technical stage to the political stage of the negotiating process, since officials had, in December, come to a sort of agreement as to how negotiations were to be proceeded with, although it is still not yet clear how the political negotiators can actually put that into an active working calendar.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment that I found very interesting was from Commissioner Fischler, who said what we would do, and added that it would not be at any price. That is, of course, an allusion to the European agenda and to the issue of how our thinking can have any influence in the context of the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">What, though – if I may make so bold as to ask the two Commissioners – does that actually mean in concrete terms? Next year is an election year and a difficult one; you two will still be here in its first half, then things will get critical, and then – so to speak – you will no longer be there. We do not know who will be. The situation is similar on the American side – Bob Zoellick will not be coming back again either – and nor is the geostrategic situation straightforward; look at the way things are shaping up in India, look at China or at Brazil. So I ask you both: what do you now expect to happen, and how are you preparing yourselves for it? What is in your calendars for January, February, and March, and when do you think the political stage will begin?</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second question. Where is the pain barrier? Where do we really think it is? What is the ‘not at any price’ issue? The Singapore issues? I think not. Agriculture? Perhaps, but I have seen the draft working document on the market organisation for sugar. Will you, Commissioner, produce a final draft by the end of your term of office? You see, where is our pain barrier? If we know a bit more about that, I believe we might perhaps be able to be a bit more proactive in steering the process that you all and we all want. In relation to that, please allow me to put a final question to the two Commissioners: what do you now, really, think of Bob Zoellick’s latest venture? I heard brief indications that you take a positive view of it, but could you go into more detail about just how positive? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The vast majority of countries and people were actually glad that the Cancún Conference collapsed. The earth did not stop turning as a result and neither, moreover, did the world of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We could have left it at that and therefore preserved our way of life, because that is what this is all about, the covetousness of multinational markets. But we were reckoning without the Commission’s being so proactive; without you, Commissioner Lamy, being so proactive, if I may say so. In fact, this proactive stance owes nothing to any economic or social imperative – we have not heard anyone lament the failure of Cancún – but is actually due entirely to your desire to exercise and defend the Commission’s monopoly on representing the EU and negotiating on its behalf in the field of international business and external trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The relentless pursuit of this goal that you are proposing to us is in fact not at all guided by the interests of Europe, but by the specific interests of the Commission in Brussels, at a time when the danger threatening our external trade, Commissioners, is not the lack of new outlets for our products but quite clearly the insurmountable and intolerable handicap imposed on us by an introverted European Central Bank, which delivers the most expensive, and by no means the strongest, currency in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where do we go from our new position? Mrs Mann said, quite rightly, that we will have new people, both from America and from the European Union. We must make sure that people understand the position in which the European Union has put itself. Commissioner Lamy said in his speech that we have correctly reformed to move forward. How right he is. One of the reasons for the failure of the Cancún debate was its use and misuse, for example by NGOs. I have two press releases, one from Oxfam and the other from Friends of the Earth, one of which states that the G21 today refused to accept European plans to expand the WTO and bring in new negotiations to liberalise investment. Mr Rübig talked about small and medium-sized enterprises, the very things that are needed within the European Union and within the developing countries to help them. They are the backbone of their future.</p>
<p class="contents">The other press release mentions bullying. Could I ask this august House whether our two Commissioners look like bullies? Have they been throwing their weight around the WTO trying to bully the emerging democracies into submission? Not at all. We reformed. Commissioner Fischler worked hard on the reformation of the common agricultural policy. That is the way forward. We must get the message across: the European Union is there to negotiate. Commissioner Lamy has put forward 'everything but arms' in the new proposals that are helping these underdeveloped countries. We must get these points across and make sure that we have multilateral discussions with EU involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I must say how well the European Parliament meetings in Cancún were received, and how well we were supported by some of the developing countries. It is important that we play a strong and future-oriented role in the next negotiations. I rely on the new negotiators, whoever they may be, to make sure we get that point across. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the eve of Cancún, the United States, the EU and the developing countries agreed to flesh out paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration, which has to do with the production of medicines for developing countries undergoing serious health crises. The agreement is not brilliant, but it is a start, although we now have to think about implementing it. I have meanwhile gleaned from the press that the United States is backtracking from it. That is why now is the time for the European Union to take a few convincing steps. So far, though, the European Union is showing little initiative. An opportunity to carry out in practice the decision of 30 August was recently lost with the review of legislation on pharmaceuticals. The Commission appears to be of the opinion that this matter belongs in Community and national patent legislation, but that is insufficient. The Community patent is still some way off and does not involve existing patents. Moreover, the Community patent does not affect data protection in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">The health crisis in Africa is an urgent problem. Last month, it became known that AIDS has claimed five million casualties over the past year. It is beyond me why the EU has not so far been prepared to do what the EU agreed upon prior to the Conference of Cancún.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what I want to know from you is when the European Union will have taken the legal measures in order to speed up the production of generic medicines for developing countries. What pledges can you make to Parliament today? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to again consider the further concessions and the proposal for duty-free access, because this does not, in my view, constitute the most effective means to help farmers in these countries, whilst it would permanently jeopardise many strategic European products.</p>
<p class="contents">As a negotiating tactic, I would strengthen the argument in defence of the Community system, to guarantee stability mechanisms on the world market, knowing that stability of world prices is beneficial to all members of the World Trade Organisation. In order to do this, and not cause a structural crisis in the agriculture sector, I am adamant that the results of the WTO negotiations should not go further than the decisions taken in Berlin in the context of Agenda 2000 and supporting prices and markets should remain a fundamental element in the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Following changes to the United States support system that were, in my view, very intelligent, we need to review our internal support to examine to what extent the GATT agreement is being respected and to assess the effect of aid on market prices and the competitive positions of commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important that the issue of the great challenges posed by enlargement for the European Union is raised during the WTO talks. This is a process of worldwide significance that must, in my view, be recognised at the negotiation table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cotton cultivation in Europe, in fact, only accounts for 1% of the world's surface area and 15% of European needs. The remaining 85% is imported mainly from the poorer countries, without tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have other third countries, such as the United States, which is the world's largest exporter of cotton, or China, which dominates the market by being the world's main producer, the main consumer of industrial cotton and the main exporter of textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the insignificance of cotton in Europe, however, there have been certain statements against Community policy on the sector, which I believe to be entirely demagogic, since in the European Union export refunds are not given and goods are imported freely, without tariffs. Specifically, France led the proposal on the part of four African countries at the WTO ministerial conference in Cancún to remove aid for cotton and has subsequently presented a European initiative on cotton which attempts to promote a Commission-led action programme in favour of the African cotton-growing economies and, at the same time, includes a reference urging reform of the system of aid for cotton, partially decoupling it from production.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like Commissioner Lamy to hear me: Commissioner, I believe that this attitude can only be interpreted as a wink or a gesture of rapprochement by France to these countries and the powerful interests of French capital in the African cotton sector by means of the French Company for the development of textile fibres and its subsidiaries in Africa, with the French State as the main participant in its capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In no way can this justify the belligerence allowed by the Commission in Cancún, with a proposal which it was inappropriate to present in that forum and which unjustly condemns Community policy in this sector. Neither does it justify the reform of the Community system of aid for cotton as suggested by the Commission, the approval of which would mean the social and economic death of many communities, without – and this is more serious – as a result resolving the problems of competitiveness of the sector in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to European agriculture in general, I would like to point out that the objective agreed at the G20 is to achieve an agreement on the dismantling of aid for exports, as well as a significant reduction in tariffs and direct aid which distort the market. Nevertheless, it appears, Mr Lamy, that in your meeting with the G20 countries, held in Brasilia, the European Union would have accepted the demand to define the criteria relating to the green box in a more restrictive manner. I would like you to either confirm or deny this information because, Commissioner, agreeing to discuss it goes further than the mandate that you had received, but, above all, it directly affects the very principles of the reform of the CAP which we approved six months ago and not just that of cotton which we are discussing here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to adopt measures in favour of the least-developed countries, but what benefits them more, and they say this themselves, is greater viability for their exports rather than a growth in the volumes exported, which in reality benefits the marketing companies based in the most developed countries. For example, sugar producers believe that export quotas for sugar at guaranteed prices are more profitable for their economies than the possibility of exporting without restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge you to consider all of this very carefully and to listen to the supposed beneficiaries of all these policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is an interesting statement, because it seems to indicate a change of attitude on the part of the United States and suggest that it will be possible to relaunch the negotiations in the WTO. It also comes on top of the initiatives that the Commission itself has taken with a view to relaunching these negotiations. But relaunching them does not mean letting go, facilitating does not mean abandoning everything, and I have to confess that after listening to this morning’s interventions I am a little concerned at the attitude expressed by a number of our Members, in particular on the Singapore issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always said here in the European Parliament that we are in favour of regulated trade facilitation. We are in favour of liberalising trade subject to certain standards and rules, and it is clear that the Singapore issues will force the World Trade Organisation to lay down a number of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that they omit certain aspects. Personally, I would have liked social issues to have been taken into account in this context, but in Doha we were obliged, under pressure, to abandon the corresponding standards. What worries me is that we now seem to want to abandon the Singapore issues too. What chance do we have, if we adopt this position, of seeing social issues and the like reappearing on the negotiating table, if the few areas that had been accepted as a potential basis for negotiation are abandoned today?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union has, through you, taken a series of initiatives with a view to facilitating matters. I think that we should leave it at that. The purpose of today’s debate is not to reopen the Doha negotiations but to apply all of the agreements, including those on the issues that concern us and that affect the kind of globalisation that we want to develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I completely agree with this statement and therefore, just as I regretted the failure of Cancún at the time, today I must regret the lack of progress at the Geneva meeting in December, while acknowledging that the simple fact of having resumed talks is positive, although, as the President of the General Council has recognised, those talks have only served to provide a clearer view of the key issues and to make us aware of the difficulties we are going to face, as well as reaffirming, on the part of the members of the WTO, the commitment to the Doha programme and, above all, the multilateral trade system, which, in itself, is of sufficient importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has now come to show flexibility in our positions, so that we can move on from words to actions and furthermore do it at the pace that the calendar set at Doha requires. I therefore believe that we should thank Commissioners Lamy and Fischler for their efforts to open up channels for dialogue with everybody and between everybody, as well as the work done with the clear objective of moving the Doha agenda forward without losing sight of the European Union's legitimate interests.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I completely agree with the analysis and the proposals contained in the Commission communication, particularly with regard to industrial tariffs and the need to achieve certain levels of commitment, particularly on the part of the emerging countries, which are much higher than those proposed in the Debray document and, in any event, equivalent to those of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard more specifically to tariffs for textile products, the Commission's document talks about negotiating new reductions which are as close as possible to zero, a proposal I totally agree with, provided that this does not mean - and I hope the Commissioner will clarify this – that the European Union will be obliged to reduce its tariffs, while others have not achieved an equivalent level for theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put a final question, Mr President. This morning, Mr Lamy also referred to the European Union becoming more flexible in environmental terms. I would like to ask him how far he intends that flexibility to go, because there is no doubt that the high costs in the environmental field are one of the causes of the relocation of many Community companies, but there is only one planet Earth, and the legislation demanded in order to achieve environmental development at planetary level must also be planetary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my gratitude for the constructive contributions, of which we have heard a great many during the course of today. I would simply like to comment on the issues relating specifically to agriculture, and then my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy will round off the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">It was asked whether there are signs that the USA is now showing more flexibility on the cotton issue. Well, as you know, Bob Zoellick has sent a letter to all WTO members in which he specifically addresses the issue of cotton. In fact, he devotes a whole chapter to it, and from the way he presents it, there are indeed signs of more openness on this issue. At any rate, he shows that he is open to reforms not only on export subsidies – that these should be eliminated, also as regards market liberalisation and the adoption of a less trade-distorting system of domestic support – but he also indicates that ways of providing better support to the very poor countries, which are wholly dependent on cotton production, should be developed through development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on what Mrs González said about cotton cultivation and the importance of cotton for Europe. I must stress, yet again, that it is true that European output only amounts to around 2% of the global market. It is also true that we do not apply any export subsidies and that we have completely opened our cotton markets to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) through the EBA decision. Indeed, as you know, there is a proposal to amend our cotton regime, which would result in less trade-distorting measures for cotton; in other words, a mix of blue box and green box measures. I am working towards the adoption of a decision on this issue in the Council of Agriculture Ministers in March.</p>
<p class="contents">On Japan’s rice policy, we all know that rice is a very sensitive issue for Japan and it has always been viewed as such. However, we have seen that Japan has recently commenced bilateral negotiations with a number of WTO member states. The rice issue is indeed included on the agenda for these bilateral negotiations and is an element of the negotiations, and one outcome is that the Japanese have generally started to adopt, shall we say, a more constructive or less rigid position on this issue in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">It was claimed that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime. In fact, this is quite simply wrong; our mandate states quite specifically that we can indeed propose this for various products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Mann asked me about progress on our sugar proposal. We are working hard on preparing a proposal and I have already said that I am aiming to submit the proposal to the Commission in mid 2004 and then present it to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final comment; I would like to ask this House to play a part in intensifying the dialogue that we proposed in our opening statement. We need more, we need more intensive talks, and I would ask you in particular to deepen the discussions with the NGOs, for some of the NGOs sometimes come up with ideas that are quite contrary to Europe’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you all to consider that waiting is in any event bad for us, for the European Union, and also for European agriculture. Please consider this: the very positive reactions to our reforms around the world will fade away as the gap between the adoption of these reforms and the progress of the WTO negotiations widens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our main objectives in these negotiations remain the same: firstly, an additional phase of market opening; secondly, better rules to govern multilateral trade and, finally, better integration of developing countries, which so far have had only a very unequal share in the benefits of increased international trade. If we try to translate all of this into an answer to your questions – what needs to be done, what has to be our objective for 2004 – then it is quite straightforward. Our objective for 2004 is to achieve before the summer what could not be done in Cancún; in other words, it is to complete two thirds of the negotiating process. That is our political objective for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, you will say, given what you said in your introduction to the debate on how the work is progressing in Geneva, such an objective will no doubt require energy and acceleration. The current work rate and the pressure in the Geneva boiler will have to be increased and, like others, we intend to stoke up the Geneva boiler to get things moving. With this in mind – I have said this and I will say it again in response to Mrs Mann’s question – the letter that my American counterpart has circulated in recent days and on which he commented in the press yesterday is good news, because it gives the lie to a theory that was gaining currency and according to which 2004, an election year in the United States, was going to be a lost year. Well, it is not! 2004 may very well not be a lost year and it is important that two of the major players in world trade, the United States and Europe, support this idea. To achieve this we are of course going to have to get moving and we are going to work, as we have started doing since our mandate was renewed, with the G20, the G90, the United States and Japan, to mention just the main players of the moment, within a system of variable geometry that will enable us to put forward our own position in the best conditions. As Mr Fischler rightly said, in our efforts to work on this process and drive it forward, if we are going to raise the temperature, we are going to need you and the contacts that you maintain with your colleagues in each of the major blocks that I have just mentioned. That is what I had to say in response to the support expressed by a large majority during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now respond briefly to a few criticisms. Mr Lannoye reproaches us, basically, in two respects: firstly, we did not redraft our mandate, we only repositioned it and, secondly, within this mandate traces of the so-called Singapore issues survive. Yes, Mr Lannoye is right that we did not redraft our mandate and that we repositioned it. And if there is a lesson to learn from what has happened between Cancún and now, we should bear in mind that no one around the WTO table has asked to renegotiate the programme of negotiations that was adopted in Doha. It is this programme that is on the table and it is this programme that needs to be negotiated. As for the Singapore issues, it is true that we have adopted a more flexible position. We see our priorities as facilitating trade and introducing greater transparency into public procurement, for reasons that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance should understand, being so keen on transparency. In a number of cases this would actually be very beneficial to facilitating trade, in particular for small and medium-sized companies, which often, alas, do not have the resources to pay for the trouble-shooters that the major multinational groups can afford to employ to speed up decisions and ensure a smooth passage through procedures, customs and other networks.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Désir, I will simply say once again that their fears about public services are unfounded. My mandate on this point is clear and completely unambiguous. I have never strayed from it and what is more I have no intention of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to two specific points in response to comments made by Mrs Ferrer and Mrs Corbey. Mrs Ferrer, on the textiles sector, we are prepared to reduce our textiles tariffs and therefore what remains of our industrial protection, but obviously on one condition, and that is that others do the same, which is part of the negotiations. Mrs Corbey was enquiring about where we were on access to medicines: we are working on this in the two arenas where this work is now being followed up. The first of these is Geneva, where we need to transpose the terms of the August agreement into the TRIPS Agreement, and we are working hard on this. It is not as straightforward as it would seem, because the balance that was struck in August between the various different parties and the various different requirements needs to be reflected faithfully in a text that will now be a legal text and, clearly, this requires a little work. We are also working on this within the European Union, because we want, as it were in anticipation, to amend our own provision on obligatory licensing in European legislation to bring it into line with the new WTO agreement and possibly allow easier access in a number of developing countries. We are going to do so by tabling a proposal for a recommendation in the Council of Ministers because, pending the entry into force of the European legislation on patents, which has been adopted but will only take effect in a number of years, the only way of implementing this agreement on access to medicines is to amend existing national laws one by one. We are therefore going to have the Council adopt a recommendation, if it agrees, and we have every reason to think that this will be the case, to ensure that the necessary amendments are made to each of the national laws, pending of course an update to the European provisions, which, I would remind you, will only come into force in a few years’ time. Those are the answers that I wanted to give at this stage and I would like to thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contempt, a lack of self-criticism and a reluctance to question remain at the heart of the Commission’s creed. Faced with Commissioner Lamy’s statements – rubberstamped by the Council – the poorest countries neither wish to sign up to the supposed new proposals nor are they awarding full marks to the policies implemented since Seattle. On the contrary, the people of the South are organising themselves and resisting European ambitions and the WTO. The opening up of trade in services provided for by the GATS and the no less sacrosanct opening of the market – put forward as a clear benefit for developing countries! – have been clearly identified as dangers by the countries of the South.</p>
