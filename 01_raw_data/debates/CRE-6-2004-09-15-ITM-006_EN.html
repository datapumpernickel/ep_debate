<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zalm,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we had an interesting meeting in Scheveningen. The discussion was based on three papers. First, a Commission communication on the Stability and Growth Pact; second, a Court ruling on the excessive deficit procedure with reference to Germany and France; and third, a statement by the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact. Ministers agreed that the Commission communication offered a good basis for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion was held in two parts. First, we had a long discussion in the euro group with the 12. Next, we discussed these conclusions in the group of 25, because the other 13 hope to become members of EMU as soon as possible. The first conclusion we came to – contrary to some press interpretations – is that Ministers are not seeking to water down the pact, but rather want it to be strengthened, clarified and better implemented. Of course, the discussions could not be concluded in a single day, so we gave our collaborators some political guidance to enable them to work on the question in the future, together with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing we noticed is that, contrary to what is sometimes thought, the Stability Pact has proven its usefulness in anchoring budget deficits. If you compare, for example, the budget deficits in the Member States during the current slowdown with earlier slowdowns, or with what is happening elsewhere in the world, it can be seen that the pact has contributed to lower deficit levels than we would otherwise have seen. If you also look at interest rates and inflation, we can be pleased with the effects of the combined budgetary and monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point we agreed upon is that we will not change anything as far as the 3% or 60% criteria are concerned – these are in the Treaty, are of paramount importance and should not be changed. We also agreed that a rule-based system remains the best guarantee for ensuring that commitments are enforced for all Member States in an equal way. We agreed that the Treaty should not be changed at all and that changes to regulations should be kept to a minimum, if indeed they are needed at all, but we are not sure of that yet.</p>
<p class="contents">In strengthening and clarifying the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to strengthening its economic rationale and its implementation. To ensure the credibility of the framework, rules should be kept both transparent and simple. We think the following elements should be analysed. Firstly, the preventive arm of the pact should be strengthened. A more symmetrical approach to fiscal policy is needed through budgetary discipline during good times so as gradually to achieve budgetary surpluses when the upswing comes. Secondly, we shall use peer pressure and peer support at an early stage of budgetary deviations, rather than waiting until a country breaches the 3% rule. Thirdly, we need transparent budgetary figures and growth assumptions in order to identify and correct budgetary deviations in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue we discussed was debt and debt sustainability. The focus on these elements should be enhanced. Firstly, more attention should be paid to the fact that a debt ratio should be sufficiently diminishing if it is above its reference value, approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace. Secondly, in assessing whether a Member State has reached sustainable public finances, the costs of ageing should be taken into account. Thirdly, we agreed to look further into the issue of debt sustainability. One particular concern centred on the possible statistical implications of pension reforms. Thus concerns a few countries, but is something we should investigate further.</p>
<p class="contents">A third important element is that when a country is subject to an excessive deficit procedure and we have to assess whether it is complying with the recommendations, we should make a clear distinction between measures taken, on the one hand, and economic forecasting errors. Until now we issued recommendations on the efforts required and hoped for a result, but that result was in the same spirit as the written forecast. Thus in future, when assessing whether or not a country has met the recommendations, we should make a distinction between policy mistakes and forecasting mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary policies need to set the right priorities for structural reforms, innovation and competitiveness in support of the Lisbon Agenda to promote economic growth and create jobs. We asked the Economic and Financial Committee and the Commission to work these principles out further so we can have another discussion at ministerial level. We also agreed that it would be best to hold this discussion in parallel with discussions on France and Germany and the excessive deficit procedure applied to them.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Almunia,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to start by thanking you for inviting me to this debate on the Stability and Growth Pact. As you know, in September the European Commission approved a communication on strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is very important that there be a debate not just in the Council, like the debate we held last weekend – and those we will have over the coming weeks and months – but also in this Parliament and in the national parliaments, on the framework for economic governance and, in particular, the situation and the future prospects of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said, last weekend in the Hague, both in the Eurogroup of 12 and around the table of the extended Eurogroup – the informal Ecofin of 25 – we held an initial debate on this issue. The Council has agreed that the Commission’s Communication provides a good basis for discussion and now we trust that in the coming weeks and months the work we are going to carry out at a more technical level between representatives of the Member States in the Economic and Financial Committee and the Commission will allow us to go to the November Ecofin with a degree of agreement with much more content than we have been able to debate and achieve on many points involving the more general ideas and principles included in the Commission’s Communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Zalm has also said, the draft Constitutional Treaty approved in June ratifies what is already included in the Treaty and we do not propose changing it. They are the basic principles, the basic reference values in terms of the evolution of public deficits and public debt and the excessive deficit procedure, as defined in the current Article 104 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not therefore a question of discussing what is not subject to discussion, because that is in the current Treaty and is going to be in the future Constitution. What we need to do is debate proposals to improve, strengthen and clarify its application and improve the degree of compliance with the framework laid down in the current Treaty and provided for, amongst other things, in the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework is based on national but coordinated economic policies involving budgetary policies that must conform to the 3% limit for budgetary deficit and the debt criterion of 60 % of Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the Commission’s ideas expressed in the Communication deal with both the coordination of economic policies and the coordination and surveillance of budgetary policies.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to economic policy, we believe there is a clear need to coordinate our actions better in the field of structural reforms and increase our efforts to implement the Lisbon Agenda. Europe needs to increase its growth potential and create more jobs and we cannot work solely on the basis of one instrument – the Stability and Growth Pact – in order to coordinate our economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore use the broad economic policy guidelines more effectively, an instrument which, by its very nature, is more flexible than the Stability and Growth Pact and, at the same time, we must improve the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by applying the preventive measures and aspects of the Pact more frequently and effectively, strengthening mutual control (peer pressure) and, in particular, we must do so during favourable periods of the economic cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to budgetary coordination, the Commission's proposals aimed at strengthening and adapting the Stability and Growth Pact are based on four main issues. Firstly, the need to place more emphasis on the level of indebtedness and on the sustainability of public finances throughout the process of monitoring the evolution of those public finances in each of the Member States. In principle, compliance with the maximum limit for deficit of 3 % must guarantee an adequate reduction in the level of indebtedness and the sustainability of the public finances of each country. In practice, however, in many countries the evolution of debt has not been as expected due to the application of exceptional measures or the appearance of implicit debts. We must therefore pay more attention to the evolution of debt in addition to tight control of the evolution of public deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made clear that the problem of sustainability does not only affect countries that already have high levels of debt, above the reference value of 60 %, but also other Member States where the percentage of their debt in relation to Gross Domestic Product is increasing or where, though it is not increasing at the moment, they know that in the future very important and very difficult challenges have to be faced, including those resulting from demographic developments and the ageing of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is aware of the need to take more account of the different national situations when it comes to monitoring the budgetary evolution of each of the countries and, in particular, when it comes to determining the mid-term objective. In a Union of 25 countries it is not a question of creating an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> pact – as some people have said – it is not the Commission’s intention to do that, but rather to apply the economic logic that suggests that it is not advisable to establish a uniform mid-term objective for the evolution of the public finances of each and every country of the enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the specific mid-term objectives for each country must in all cases guarantee compliance with the 3 % of GDP rule for their public deficits. Equal treatment for the different Members States is thereby guaranteed, regardless of their differing situations in terms of the sustainability of their public accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission believes that the debate must deal with the need to apply measures quickly, to increase the use of the preventive measures of the Stability and Growth Pact. We all know that, at the end of the Nineties and the beginning of this decade, not all the Member States took advantage of the good state of their economy, of the good stage they were at in the economic cycle, to consolidate their public finances sufficiently, which means that at times of economic difficulty they are not able, or find it very difficult, to obey the 3% rule.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these aspects – these first three blocks of ideas – as the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said, were received favourably by the Council almost immediately. On the corrective part of the Pact there was more debate and there will continue to be so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be consistent in our preventive measures, we also need, in the corrective part of the Pact, in the excessive deficit procedure, to take account of the circumstances of each country and which stage of the cycle each country's economy is at. How can this be done? By means of two possible procedures. Firstly, the current definition of exceptional circumstances included in the Stability and Growth Pact can be improved, allowing a country not be included in the excessive deficit procedure, despite being above the 3% of deficit, if it has been in a prolonged situation of growth beneath its potential level.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to distinguish between periods of cyclical low activity and those of structural low activity and in order to avoid weakening the surveillance framework, the other two requirements contained in the current exceptional circumstances clause must be applied strictly in all cases. That is to say that the deficit must be temporary and there must not be much deviation from the 3%.</p>
<p class="contents">A second consideration is the need or the possibility to adjust the path of deficit correction, the speed with which a country which is above the 3% must bring its public deficit below that reference value. The differences between the cyclical situations of the different countries in this position justify this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission’s Communication maintains the principle that an excessive deficit must be corrected quickly, but – as Mr Zalm has said – the influence of other economic factors, other than the intensity of the effort being called for and being made by the country in question on the budgetary results must be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, there is an interrelationship between these two elements included in the exceptional circumstances clause. There is a trade-off here. We cannot choose to increase the room for manoeuvre in the two simultaneously in an uncontrolled manner. If more emphasis is placed on reviewing the entry of a country into the excessive deficit procedure, we will have to be more rigid on the adjustment path. If the current rigidity in relation to entry into the excessive deficit procedure is maintained, the possibility of adjusting the deadlines once the country has been integrated into that procedure may be considered in order to conform to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that these improvements are going to provide a basis for strengthening the framework for economic governance of the Economic and Monetary Union, that these ideas and the debate which we will be holding following last weekend not only do not weaken the pact but in fact strengthen it, because the weakness of a pact, the weakness of a fiscal framework, does not just stem from the theoretical brilliance of the rules we all respect <span class="italic">a priori</span> or in theory, but also from the capacity to apply those rules and, as the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities states, the decisions fall to the Member States meeting in the Council. The Commission maintains its right to present proposals, but it is the Council, the Member States, who must apply the rules that they themselves have committed themselves to by approving the Treaty and the subsequent regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot demand that the Member States approve rules which they do not believe in themselves. And, if experience suggests that certain rules require adaptation, it is better to adapt them than not to respect them, leave them unchanged and carry on failing to comply with them, which has unfortunately been the situation at times with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have ahead of us a debate that will be a difficult one and crucial to Europe’s future. What is at stake is the credibility of the European Union, of its institutions and of the governments of the Member States. Our experience to date with the single currency has been a good one; it is stable and it and the dollar are the most important currencies in the world, the ones on which all else depends, but the strength of a currency depends not only on the independence of the central bank and on price stability; it also, and in particular, depends on the government’s financial and budgetary policies. An unsound budgetary policy can be an even greater danger in a currency union and damage the Community as a whole, that is to say, all who participate in it, particularly if certain larger countries fail to take the required and necessary action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to prevent this that the Maastricht mechanism, the Stability Pact and the relevant regulations are there, and they have been breached in the past. The fact is that, during economic boom periods, budget deficits were not reduced. Of course, we are all for policies being more flexible when times are hard economically speaking, when greater flexibility is a necessity and has to be guaranteed, but, on the other hand, we can see that there is the great danger that, if the criteria are reinterpreted, deficits will not be reduced when the economy is doing well. Our great fear is that that is what will happen. We very much welcome the European Court of Justice’s decision as regards the relevant procedures, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome last weekend’s decision to give the Commission a new mandate. I also very much welcome your statement to the effect that ‘we will stay within the 3% deficit limit, we do not want to exceed 60%’.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at overall debt, though, we see that it is already well in excess of 60% in some Member States, and so I think that reinterpreting the Treaty and the Stability Pact would encourage new indebtedness and should therefore not be contemplated.</p>
<p class="contents">The course that the Council has chosen can – as we have seen – both guarantee that the preset Budget procedure will continue and encourage a number of Member States to revert to the budgetary discipline that the Treaty prescribes and which is vital to the future of Europe. I would like to encourage the Commission to put forward a new proposal within the framework laid down by the Council, and would ask them to prevent the impression being created that we, by reinterpreting or even by amending the law, are pursuing a new European deficit management policy for which we will all have to pay dearly.</p>
<p class="contents">For how will investment be possible if interest rates end up spiralling and we have to service the debts, and then there is no money to invest in the economy? My advice to this House, then, is that we stay within the framework of the Treaty, while making use of the necessary flexibility that it provides, both when times are hard and when things are going well, in order to guarantee the continued stability of the European currency in the future.</p>

Pardon me if I exaggerate somewhat, but I sometimes got the impression that you and some of your colleagues had a positively Manichaean way of interpreting it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only ‘either/or’. Some life has been injected into the debate now that it has become evident that there is one thing that we must keep in sight if we want to save the Lisbon strategy, to defend it and advance it, and if its objectives are indeed to be achieved, and that is that all the resources at our disposal – including the Stability and Growth Pact – must be mobilised in making the Lisbon targets realities. Initiating an open-ended inquiry into whether all the measures associated with the Stability and Growth Pact, or all the interpretations placed upon it, were actually conducive to achieving this objective or whether certain modifications or revised interpretations are necessary, that is a step in the right direction, and that, I believe, is what was embarked on at the weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Almunia made a very important point about the 3%, which nobody wants to abandon, nor should anyone give up the 60%, but the crucial point is that if we retain this guideline – and our group too knows that it is indispensable – then the Commissioner’s statement to this House to the effect that, because conditions differ from one country to another, no one objective can be imposed, and that each country must be enabled, within its own specific limits, to overcome its difficulties in order to get back on track for the goals when it has problems, is also a step in the right direction, for those who want to save the Pact are thereby put in a position to be able to do so. Those who interpret the Pact only in black-and-white terms – and recent developments in some countries show that this happens – and those who say that there can be no alternative to what we conceived fourteen years ago, overlook the dynamic social and economic changes that are taking place. Commissioner Almunia’s reference to demographic development shows that we must acknowledge and take into consideration the developments of which we were as yet unaware when we first debated the Stability Pact. That means modifying it, modernising it and adapting it to present circumstances, it means securing it and guaranteeing it as the long-term basis of a stable currency. Commissioner Almunia, you have shown courage, and we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will back you up as you go down this road.</p>

Sooner or later, all of them ended in failure. It was intended that the euro should escape that fate. The Stability and Growth Pact was concluded in order to oblige the members of the eurozone to adhere to standards meant to guarantee the currency’s stability. There was meant to be an effective sanctions mechanism to bring those sinners who transgressed these rules promptly back to the path of virtue and thus make the euro credible to the finance markets and in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is rather different. For the third time in succession this year, Germany and France have breached the 3% deficit limit. Despite that, the sanctions mechanism has not yet kicked in. The pact risks being revealed to be a paper tiger; confidence in the euro is shattered, and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the promptness and decisiveness with which Commissioner Almunia has come up with proposals for saving the Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We see it as a good thing that the deficit threshold should, in principle, remain at 3%. We think it right that a state’s overall indebtedness should be more closely monitored. We accept the need to take account of population change in the Member States and its – largely adverse – effect on budgets. We welcome the observation that Member States have to accumulate surpluses in good times in order to be able to build up reserves for the bad ones, self-evident though that is.</p>
<p class="contents">Favourable though our assessment of individual elements is, we are critical of the Commission proposal as a whole. We could exaggerate and say that, as reality is not obeying the rules, the rules are being adapted to fit it. In policy terms, Germany and France have got their way, at least for the time being. For as long as the wrongdoers play a part in deciding whether or not an offence has been committed, it remains uncertain whether the sanctions mechanism will ever become operational. The origin of Germany’s difficulties is not to be found in the Stability and Growth Pact; the problems are structural and start at home. No reserves were built up when the going was good; reforms were needed but were not tackled with sufficient determination, and the state’s finances were not consolidated. The only things that will help to increase competitiveness and generate sustainable growth are a simple and attractive tax system, deregulated labour markets, and renewal of the social security and education systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Our principal criticism of the Commission’s proposals has to do with the criteria for assessing whether or not a country is adhering to the Pact, which leave a great deal of room for interpretation of such factors as, for example, adverse economic conditions, particular circumstances resulting in poor long-term growth, and factors specific to individual countries relating to the adjustment of excessive deficits. We find it doubtful that group pressure has any positive effect on the way Member States behave; on the contrary, there will be even more political chumminess of the ‘you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours’ variety. For that reason, the evaluation criteria must be unambiguous and easy to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Commissioner’s intention to make Member States’ budget policies more transparent and more binding, not least as a result of the publicity that regular reports to the European Parliament and debates on them will attract. Last weekend, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker was elected President of the euro group for the next two years. We hope he will manage to get the Member States to identify more with the Stability and Growth Pact and develop a greater sense of responsibility for it. The euro is a unique success story and must remain stable for Europe’s sake and in the public interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Starting with the Dublin and Amsterdam Councils, the Greens had taken the view that the Pact would, in time of recession, be neither applicable nor applied. That is what has come to pass. The Council imposed no sanction on the big countries when they went over the 3% threshold. Today, they account for 80% of Europe’s domestic product, and it is certain that, without this policy, Europe’s stagnation in 2003 would have turned into a recession.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the United States, China, Japan and even the United Kingdom triggered global recovery by applying a budgetary policy that would have been prohibited in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a need for reform of what President Prodi, two years ago, called ‘the stupid Pact’. Of the four recommendations that we made at that time, the Commission accepted three: to push for the restoration of a balanced budget only during periods of growth; to tolerate reasonable deficits during periods when growth is poor; to lay down monetary and budgetary rules as part of the governance of democratically debated broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, to be sure, regret the failure to consider our proposal to remove from the remaining deficits those investments in the areas covered by the Gothenburg and Kyoto targets: economy in energy, shared large-scale transport networks, and renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we reject the idea that provisions for future expenditure, such as retirement pensions, should be included among debts from now on, for we need to bear in mind that, apart from the ageing process, the disruption of the climate is the most significant debt bequeathed to future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, the Council proceeds now to adopt the Commission’s proposals, it will demonstrate that the requirement for unanimity in twenty-five countries does not prevent necessary and intelligent reforms from being adopted. Today, our fellow-citizens need such evidence and we are grateful to you for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Growth rates in most European countries are lower today than in previous years, and what has increased has been poverty, unemployment, McJobs and bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you seriously want to tell Europeans that this is what stability means? Nobody wants inflation, yet price stability bought at the cost of employment and quality of life benefits only Europe’s rich, and harms the vast majority of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the Commission’s proposals on reform of the Stability Pact do not indicate a change in thinking, but are simply cosmetic corrections aimed at reviving an obsolete concept.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that critics who accuse the Commission’s proposals of watering down the Pact have simply not realised that the Stability Pact in its original version is beyond saving. After all, there are now six European countries which have been so successful in cutting back that they are now experiencing a crisis, and it is as a result of this, rather than of expansionist spending policies, that they are no longer in a position to comply with the ‘stability’ criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Use of the Pact as a cudgel to push through cuts in social services and privatisation policies demands that it be more flexibly applied, and this is why we of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left reject the Commission’s proposals as well as the spirit and letter of the Pact itself. Anyone who has a genuine desire for stability and growth in Europe must abandon neo-liberal dogmas.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary consolidation cannot be an end in itself. Public investments secure the future and employment. The internal market requires mass purchasing power if it is to thrive, and this cannot be achieved without renewed increases in wages and social spending.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of deficits, if large European companies were finally forced to pay up by means of a high-level EU-wide harmonisation of corporation tax, and if a new Constitution committed Europe to disarmament, not rearmament, a much more effective step would be taken towards the prevention of escalating government debts than through any aggressive programmes of cuts which only serve to aggravate problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We would unreservedly support a Stability Pact for Europe which was genuinely worthy of the name and which committed the Member States to reducing poverty and unemployment instead of to indiscriminate deficit goals, with sanctions imposed on countries that failed to meet them. We are, however, firmly opposed to life-prolonging measures for an instrument which is designed to destroy the European social model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One would not expect them to. The Stability Pact is rather like the common fisheries policy: every country has an interest in other countries keeping to the rules but in not being restricted itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries policy is not working very well, nor is the Stability Pact, but – to maintain the pretence – we are now going to have a more flexible pact taking into account economic growth rates and country-specific circumstances. It sounds like a good idea, but in practice all these criteria depend on judgment, as Mr Almunia has just explained. All it will mean in the end is that a country having trouble sticking to the rules of the pact does not have to. A flexible rule ceases to be a rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The root of the problem is that there is no credible means of enforcement; there never has been. It was always ridiculous to suppose that a government having trouble paying its bills could be punished by imposing a fine; yet, as the European Central Bank points out, sound fiscal policies are vital for the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many examples of what happens to fixed exchange rate regimes when governments do not keep their budgets in order. An EMU is just a sophisticated form of a fixed exchange rate. Argentina is the most recent case of such a collapse. The problem could of course be solved by much greater control of national budgets, but that does not seem very feasible right now. Certainly we in Britain would not like to see Brussels running our Treasury.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end on a positive note. I can only say how thankful I am that Britain has not joined the euro ...</p>

We have also seen the success of the internal market in terms of net job creation. The success of economic and monetary union has eliminated the possibility of seeing hungry speculators playing one currency off against the other for personal gain, while doing serious economic damage to European countries and to their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro is a strong currency for business and it is succeeding, but we must analyse the rules governing economic coordination. Some EU countries are breaching the Stability and Growth Pact rules and are doing so with impunity. There is a question of economic credibility at play here. We either all comply with the rules or we do not. There cannot be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries. This not only impinges on the credibility of our economic rules, but it leads to a broader problem of selling a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Commission reprimanded the Irish Government a few years ago about the economic governance of our country, at a time when our economy was growing at 10% per annum. I support economic coordination, but everybody playing in the same pitch must play according to the same economic rules. I support a review of the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact. Countries with low debt should be allowed to invest in key infrastructural projects of national importance. This is serious business and EU governments must look closely at the different options available to us. Any possible change to these rules must be fair and equal to all participants.</p>

I believe that soft budget rules equal higher debts, and I believe that relaxation and non-enforcement of rules equal a loss of credibility for the entire European Union. The only message we are sending out about ourselves is that it is not those who prosper, make a profit and create jobs who are held up as an example in the European Union, but those who live on credit and put off finding a solution to their countries’ economic problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not hide from the fact that in Europe today a number of Member States are struggling with stagnation, high levels of unemployment and growing debts. I therefore believe that any display of leniency by the European Union would be out of place. In my opinion, the Commission must instead bring greater pressure to bear on the prosperity of individual countries, as well as calling for budgetary restraint, the reduction of debts and the creation of new jobs in these countries, and, above all, ensuring that the rules which the European Union has laid down for itself are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that it will not be this House, or the spin doctors of individual politicians or individual governments, which pass judgement on the Commission’s economic measures, but the global market, and the market is well known for imposing extremely heavy penalties on debtors and those who are unreliable. If the rules are relaxed, I believe that we will see a massive stampede of firms out of the European Union to Asia and Ukraine, or quite simply to regions where taxes are lower, the workforce is cheaper and, it must be admitted, the social state is cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither prosperity, nor more jobs, nor a greater competitiveness of the European Union in the global economy can be achieved by a relaxation of stability and growth. Unless the European Commission realises this and puts the brakes on spending which is not based on economic results, the Stability and Growth Pact will turn into an Instability and Failure Pact.

Although the intention is, reportedly, to strengthen the Pact, nearly all speakers have referred to its being weakened or relaxed. While it is apparently not the intention to touch the 3% standard specified in the Treaty, my gut feeling is that it is precisely this budget standard that is proving difficult to deal with. Furthermore, the enforcement of the Pact needs to be stepped up, but there is a great deal of wishful thinking about the greater impact of what is referred to as peer pressure, which certainly did not work for the big countries, and there is little in the way of more power for the Commission or of a decision-making alternative in the Council, which would lead to truly better enforcement. The advantage of the announcement is, though, that it was made now and that an open debate will follow suit, and we have plenty of cause for this. In the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this has already been the topic of an extensive debate, and we want to contribute our might with an open mind, but we will not change our guiding principle. Consequently, we have never said that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid. On the contrary, we found it to be a valuable instrument, and still do. The fact that more harmonisation is sought with other economic policy instruments, as well as fine-tuning in certain areas, an optimisation of the debt ratio, economic realism, all of these are open to discussion. What is unacceptable to us, however, is that the Stability and Growth Pact should be adapted to please a few governments. The Pact should prompt discipline, it should be a big stick to keep us on the right track. That means that the Pact must be geared to long-term challenges of our social market economy, and should not be thrown off course by short-term sirens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It breaks the taboo on tampering with the Pact as initially defined and suggests that you be pragmatic in learning the lessons of the first five years of the EMU’s operation. This it does in order to usher in a new period in the history of the single currency, which makes it possible, in reality, to combine stability with the prioritisation of growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The present framework has not only shown itself to be deficient as an instrument of growth in comparison with the performances of the world’s other major currency areas, including those of the EU Member States that remained outside the eurozone; it has also shown itself to be vulnerable in terms of its own credibility, bearing in mind not only the number and the size of the Member States that have broken its rules, but also the uncertainty prompted by the decision of November 2003, which the Court of Justice’s ruling in July really did nothing to allay.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is that we endorse your proposals, particularly those about taking better account of the link between debt, deficit, economic cycles and countries’ specific situations in order to get away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach; we also endorse the emphasis you place on prevention, on early warnings, on peer pressure, and, finally, on anticipating events rather than simply relying on the sanctions machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, however, would insist on two other items, which my colleagues will address, as it seems to us that additional measures are needed. Reform of the Pact must have as its primary objectives growth and employment, an increase in which will contribute to stability – or, to be more precise, will give the eurozone a real basis for stability – and will be achieved by making a link, which is de facto absent at the moment, between reform of the Pact, the Lisbon strategy, coordination and the Member States’ economic policy guidelines. Specifically, then, we think that the issue that has to be addressed is that of how to encourage investment in growth and how to take into account, in a nuanced way, those investments that contribute to the Lisbon strategy and to achieving its objectives, namely research, innovation, infrastructures and the major trans-European networks, without forgetting lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also have concerns about the long-term nature of debt and, at the same time, we are concerned to ensure that taking account of ageing does not become a pretext for propelling Member States towards the privatisation of their social security systems, pension schemes in particular. We would prefer this to be clarified and this argument not to be used tomorrow in an attempt the bottom line of which is to reduce social protection and social security that the people of Europe enjoy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the impression has formed that the main criterion of this Pact is the size of the fiscal deficit, and its sole goal is to ensure the stability of the euro, and all that can only be achieved by carrying out structural reforms, but the purpose of economic decisions is to ensure a growth in citizens' prosperity, allowing them to realise their potential. Unfortunately, in real economics structural reforms mean a reduction in expenditure for social programmes, which make up the largest proportion in the state finance structure. Lithuania's experience of reforms shows that if a favourable environment is not created for the transfer of capital and labour from less efficient to more productive activities, i.e. a liberal window of new opportunities is not opened for the population or business, social expenditure on structural reforms is very great and the results, due to great opposition, do not match expectations. Thus the Pact's main priority ought to be to stimulate economic dynamism, creativity and a growth in new quality jobs, so that even my sceptically minded colleagues from Britain would not doubt the substantiation of financial and economic stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Zalm, you were one of the harshest critics, because anyone who wanted to change the Stability Pact was considered a softie. As was often the case, you took visible delight in tarring all critics with the same brush, because they were all useless. May I ask you something? Is it not the case, though, that what is now acceptable to you, what you read out a moment ago, very much resembles what those self-same critics of the Stability Pact stated two years ago? Two examples: my group has always argued for more attention being paid to the public debt and somewhat less attention to the annual budget shortage. We have always said that there are situations conceivable in respect of which a Member State should not be penalised for exceeding the 3%, for example in the case of slow growth over a long period of time. Finally, I applaud the fact that the Council and Commission now appear to be willing to be more flexible in their interpretation of the Stability Pact. Mr Zalm, I would urge you, though, to display the same level of honesty and flexibility, and refrain from saying that you will be clarifying and improving the statute. Instead, I would prefer you to say that you are finally taking the constructive criticism of the Green and Left Members of this House seriously and are therefore updating the Pact. Mr Zalm, there comes a time for everyone when they have to admit that they are wrong. This is the time for you to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They put national budgets under greater control, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the European monopolies by reducing taxation and granting new privileges to big business. They place particular emphasis on public borrowing, in order to persuade the pension systems to make immediate changes, they further commercialise care, they reduce social spending and they promote quicker capitalist restructurings, in order to reduce the cost of labour and increase the profits of big business.</p>

Stability in the real economy and, thus, employment therefore presuppose instability in the budget balance. The Stability and Growth Pact was, therefore, in essence badly thought out. By placing the emphasis on stability within the public finances, it contributed to instability in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s reform plan is therefore a step in the right direction, but it gives cause for concern. This step is being taken because large and powerful countries failed to meet the demands made in the Stability and Growth Pact. Intellectual arguments and political will to stabilise employment were not enough. It does not bode well for continued cooperation within the EU that power is more important than intellectual arguments. It was therefore right, and important, to demand that large countries too follow the applicable rules even when these appear less appropriate.</p>

Twelve countries belong to the eurozone, and the Pact lays down the rules for membership in it. It is the basis for public debate on the link between budgetary discipline, inflation, price stability, growth and employment, for the debate on structural problems in Europe and for the debate on the Commission’s role with regard to the Member States’ economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pact must not be used as an excuse for personal failures and omissions; it is a mandate for action by the Member States and the Commission. The European Court of Justice has strengthened the Commission’s position and, in doing so, the Pact. The new Constitution has strengthened the Pact and the European Central Bank by including price stability as an objective in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not change the ground rules, which is precisely what those who believe that flexibility means relaxation do. Those who, like Mr Eichel, wish to muzzle the Bundesbank, fail to recognise the role played by an independent issuing bank and the importance of transparency for trust, reliability and credibility. I support the Council’s position and the ECB President, Mr Trichet, in the comments he has made. We need clear rules that apply to everyone and successful implementation. We have no problem with the Pact; what we have is an implementation deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am also in favour of a debate on the ways in which we can boost the significance of total debt, establish criteria for accumulating much-needed budget surpluses during times of economic prosperity, incorporate the consequences of demographic change and conduct a public debate on the difference between structural debt and investment debt.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a debate on the Commission’s powers to implement the Pact. Anyone who incurs debt for debt’s sake is selling off the future. We want the European public to have confidence in the rules we set for ourselves, and we want the public to be sure that everyone in Europe is equal before the law and is treated fairly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate, and thank, Mr Zalm, Chairman of the Ecofin Council, for the fact that, indeed, he has not remained stuck in the past, and like Mr Lagendijk, I would not like to be the one to resolve past issues either. What I do hope, though, is that he does not only act out of self-interest and on the basis of tactical considerations, but that, in terms of substance, he is now also convinced that it is important economically speaking to place more emphasis on the growth element of the Pact. I would also like to note that my group very much appreciates the fact that you have indicated a wish to continue the debate with our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I think it is important for us in the European Parliament to be involved in this too.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as content is concerned, clearly, my group is positive about the direction that the Commission document is taking. We have always called for a better balance to be struck between the objectives for growth and stability. We would like to put a stop to the conflict of, on the one hand, ambitious Lisbon objectives and, on the other hand, budget standards that have been set too low over a longer recession period in order to be able to invest in renewed economic growth. It is absurd that, for example, in Portugal, expenditure for research and development and education is being cut rather than increased and that Greece is being punished – another example of a country exceeding its budget – in connection with those splendid Olympic Games which we all thoroughly enjoyed. Even in my own country, I can give the example of the discussion with local governments about the way in which they are permitted to fund investments out of the reserves. That would be positive for growth if it were not for the fact that they would be faced with an investment ban if the budget shortage of 3% were exceeded, which is absurd at this stage. My group therefore supports a Growth Pact that is formulated more precisely. I should like to bring you two elements at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I am keen to hear your views about the golden rule. As you know, in the United Kingdom, of all places, a country outside the eurozone, a very strong appeal is being made to draw the distinction between current budget spending and investment spending. Your objection had always been that those boundaries cannot be clearly marked. My appeal would not be to leave this also to the resourcefulness of the national finance ministers individually, but, in fact, to find out whether we cannot extract common standards from the Lisbon objectives, the broad economic guidelines, and hopefully soon also the opinion of Wim Kok’s high-level group. My argument is that we would then be able to transform those many fine commitments of Lisbon and of subsequent summits into real investment and growth plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would propose to implement this in multi-annual plans complying with the deadline of 2010 or later. What do you think of the idea of writing off that growth and those growth investments over several years, so that they are not included in the 3% standard on an annual basis?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to hear from you whether you are prepared to conduct discussions of this kind in the Ecofin Council, and I hope that, in doing so, we can get the pact back on its two feet, which it needs, namely stability and growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The decisions made in recent years have ensured stability and kept inflation under control, but growth has remained low and there are no binding rules for implementing the Lisbon objectives. Growth in Europe must be raised in qualitative terms back to rates of at least 3%. Reform of the Pact may be one of the means by which we can get out of the slowdown. The Commission’s proposal, presented here by Mr Almunia, is a good starting point but needs to be improved. The Member States must turn this debate into a really thorough discussion, like the one that accompanied Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion should be structured around three key points. First, the future Pact should be ‘Lisbonised’, giving greater weight to all those criteria connected with structural reforms, innovation and investment in research and development. The proposals concerning the golden rule should be restored, but with the constraint that investments beyond the 3% should be set up and managed at Community level and should not deteriorate into a mere market for the interests of the various countries, as Mr Klinz has just said. Secondly, with regard to debt, the trend needs to be the decisive criterion, not the amount. Thirdly, clarification is needed regarding the credibility that the Commission wants the Pact to have, since the Pact was thrown into a serious crisis by the Ecofin decision in November and by the final text of the Constitution on the balance of power between Ecofin and the Commission, which favours the national governments more than the Convention’s text did.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I must point out that, if no solution is found to the political problem of the credibility of the Pact and of the Member States’ commitment to abide by it, then the whole point at issue is likely to be merely academic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In those two years, the debate has continued to rage and culminated in the Commission proposals which were discussed during the last Ecofin Council in Scheveningen.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission proposals offer a basis for continuing to shape the discussion about the Stability and Growth Pact, and the implementation of the Pact continues to benefit from clear and transparent decision-making. There is still a need for unambiguous sanctions. The discussion that is now being held should not harm the Pact’s implementation or trust in the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, it was said in the debate that more account should be taken of economic trends, thus enabling the surpluses saved up from prosperous years to be used in lean years. I should like to hear from Mr Zalm whether this suggestion has been taken on board and whether that might well prove to be the key to an acceptable new Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask whether the Council could shed more light on the tasks and responsibilities of Ecofin’s next chairman, Mr Juncker. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Pact is sufficiently flexible and does not need to be changed. The question we must therefore now ask ourselves is why, two years later, there is a sudden demand for change – one that may appear different, but comes from the same family of parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The way I see it, it is to your credit that you are undertaking a final rescue bid for the Pact, because what has become apparent is quite simply that the finance ministers, in particular the German and French finance ministers, may create European legislation, but do not abide by it. I remember how Mr Zalm, the Finance Minister, addressed our committee and, amongst other things, called for everyone to be treated equally. I would like to stress this point; everyone must be treated equally, and the law applies to everyone. I also welcome the fact that you do not wish to amend the Treaties and that there will be no change to the figures of 3% and 60%.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of flexibility, and indeed there are good economic reasons for flexibility. I would, however, like to make it quite clear that these reasons must be specified. In this instance flexibility appears to be a license for anyone with a few national peculiarities to ask to have these taken into account, and the Commission hands them what they want on a plate. The Commission must make improvements in this respect and elaborate on the relevant details.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find particularly regrettable is that even the Commission is not addressing the problems relating to the Pact, and you need to have a better procedure for dealing with them. If you tell governments that they must make savings and reduce debt when better times arrive, I do not believe that they will suddenly do so merely because the Commission tells them to, but because they want to make good on their election promises when the income situation improves. This, then, is where the Commission’s role must be strengthened vis-à-vis the Council on this issue. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in this House support you, and I hope that at least some of the finance ministers do too.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with one final comment; the Stability and Growth Pact should not be blamed already for the likely potential failure of the Lisbon Strategy, which is the fault of national governments. That would amount to myth making, which should not be allowed under any circumstances.</p>

Those who do not treat the Stability and Growth Pact as a fetish have been waiting for this moment for a long time. A taboo has been broken; we can talk about the Stability and Growth Pact, and can even talk about reforming it. Commissioner, you really do have my warmest congratulations, because the Finance and Economy Ministers have said that they regard your communication as a good basis on which to work. It seems to me, then, that we have taken a major step forward. No doubt you have been aided by the French and German situations, and by the ruling of the Court of Justice, but the step has been taken, so let us make good use of it and of the space that it has opened up to us.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an opportunity to be seized, primarily to put things back in order, and so I cannot go along with Mr Radwan’s assessment. This is not a matter of ascertaining whether the Lisbon strategy has failed or whether the Pact needs to be saved. What is at issue is how we use the Pact to make the Lisbon strategy succeed, and, looking at it from that angle, it strikes me that we must and can make more of an effort to keep track of expenditure. By this I mean the expenditure that contributes to the implementation of the whole Lisbon strategy; I do not think of competitiveness as being the alpha and omega of the Lisbon strategy. The Lisbon strategy will succeed if it is founded upon a strategy aiming at full employment and sustainable development on the basis of research and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I turn now to a point that you raise in your communication, but which appears to me to be no more than lightweight and needing more work to be done on it, namely the link between coordination and the Stability and Growth Pact. You know better than I do that this coordination exercise has been, up to now, a purely academic one. The thing that makes it possible for it to become a ground rule and to define the quality of policy, does not work. The result is that all we have is a Stability and Growth Pact that, like a balance sheet, enables us to observe how things happened, without being able to determine the dynamics of it or the collective choice.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my last point, the only thing that involves this House: the issue of the democratic debate on your proposals, on the implementation and coordination of the Stability Pact. Here there is much to be done. You make reference to this House at one point in your communication, but it would appear that this is almost a formality and that, at the end of the day, debate is, in essence, reserved for a very select and very definitely closed club consisting of the euro group speaking through the Ecofin Council. This wall has to be broken down. The debate must break out of this enclosure, for if it does not, economic policies, which are, in the final analysis, a matter for the collective choice of societies for the good of their peoples, will not be placed in the public arena. If this House, and the committee I chair, can contribute to this, I think we will have done a good job of work together. I wish you good luck!</p>

<p class="contents">Why are you in such a rush, Commissioner, to devise new rules? Why do you not follow your predecessor, Mr Solbes, who thought that the Stability and Growth Pact was perfectly alright. I think we must wait until the new Commission begins. It is the Commission that is to administer and oversee these rules. We also have Mr Zalm back in his seat as the Netherlands’ representative, so that we might again hear his normally tough position on this issue, which I of course love. So let us wait a little.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the time not being used to discuss the Commission’s role in the Stability and Growth Pact: the issue of whether a warning can be given without the finance ministers having to approve it, as well as the issue of its having been possible to contrive for those countries that act contrary to the Stability and Growth Pact generally to have voting rights in the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask the chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who has unfortunately left his seat, why someone does not get hold of Mr Schroeder and tell him that he should observe the rules? A flexible Stability and Growth Pact will not, of course, help him.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schroeder has the problem of not keeping to the Stability and Growth Pact, and flexible rules will not help him, so make sure now that he is made to follow the rules. What Germany needs are major structural reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This justifies, albeit belatedly, the criticisms that we have made from the very outset. We have criticised the 3% public deficit limit and warned of its social and economic impact. We can only regret, however, that these proposals have come to light only after successive years of non-compliance by France and Germany, and are really little more than a cosmetic exercise that lets France and Germany off the hook.</p>
<p class="contents">We know how the Stability and Growth Pact has served to justify withdrawing public investment, particularly in the social areas for which the State is responsible, thereby encouraging further privatisation. We all know that the consequences of a slow-down, of stagnation and in some countries, such as Portugal, of economic recession are rising unemployment and social exclusion. What we are saying, therefore, is that we urgently need to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact and to undertake a root and branch review of economic and monetary orientations in the EU. In order to safeguard economic and social development, it should be replaced by a pact that genuinely helps to create jobs and to foster social progress, a pact that prioritises social economic cohesion, jobs and social inclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not going to apologise for that because I believe the British economy is better off outside the eurozone, and our significantly higher growth rate compared to the average eurozone country bears this out. However, as my party leader, Michael Howard, noted in a recent speech in Berlin, we believe that different combinations of Member States should have the possibility of pooling their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing. Thus we wish our colleagues in the eurozone well.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all for the principle that governments should avoid excessive budget deficits, especially when an economy is growing strongly and unemployment is low. It should have been simple for us to have kept our spending within the limits required of members of the European Union, since all of us – not just members of the euro – are supposed to abide by these guidelines. When Britain exceeded the 3% budget deficit ceiling, it escaped the censure of the Commission because it is not in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of other European nations were not so lucky: the Dutch and the Portuguese have had to rein in their public spending in a tight effort to comply with the pact at a time when they have been hit by recession. However, far from being congratulated they were kicked in the teeth by the governments of France and Germany using their muscle to bend the rules and escape the fines which, if imposed, might have given them the incentive to be the team players that they sometimes urge us to be. It is difficult to overstate the damage this has caused. The euro is an ambitious project. All such projects require the injection of a vast amount of political capital. Strong currencies require credible leadership, which is lacking in this case. Ever since the euro was introduced, the very authors of the rules are the least prepared to abide by them.</p>
<p class="contents">The new guidelines announced last week pay lip-service to the need for clear and effective rules. They are in essence a surrender to political might. Many have suggested that the eventual success of the euro will be measured in the long run by whether Britain, Sweden and Denmark decide to join. I am not going to look into the crystal ball, but I have to say that the most recent moves by the guardians of the currency have done nothing to encourage those of us who are cautious and wary to sign up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This was the essence of the Court of Justice’s message on the case relating to the Stability and Growth Pact. The Court’s ruling confirmed that the Member States have discretional power at their disposal and that they have no obligation to follow the Commission; the Court also helpfully supported the Commission’s sole right of initiative. The Commission recently took an initiative aimed at altering the existing rules. We must welcome this political act by the Prodi Commission and must thank Commissioner Almunia.</p>
<p class="contents">Socialists advocate a policy of stability and of fighting inflation, yet stability without growth leads to a sacrifice of future expenditure and to an austerity policy, on account of which the poorest sections of the public will be the first to suffer. Even though the two pillars of the Pact, the famous 3% and 60%, are not based on pure science, the aims must not be changed. The individual situation in each of the twenty-five Member States varies markedly. According to the evidence, a State with a debt of around 60% of its GDP has more room for manoeuvre than a State saddled with a public debt of over 100%.</p>
<p class="contents">Socialists would like to give Member States a margin of flexibility in the event of an economic downturn, so that they can pursue a structural policy of regeneration, even if that means – and on this point I agree with Mr Radwan – imposing tighter budgetary discipline during times of strong growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, above all, assess the quality of public spending. We must choose between consumer spending and expenditure for the future. Borrowing must be restricted solely to productive investment. This is based on a premise of better economic governance at EU level and of more thorough coordination of economic policy. Whilst one must welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has a permanent chairman in the shape of Mr Junker, it nonetheless remains the case that a chairman simply presides over meetings and does not make decisions. For the Stability Pact to become a Growth Pact too, coercive measures must be implemented in the area of national budgetary practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB has reacted negatively towards the Commission’s proposals. I am grateful to Mr Zalm for responding somewhat frostily to what was said by the European Central Bank. The ECB’s independence is, and will remain, set in stone by the Treaty. Whilst the responsibility for monetary policy lies solely with the Central Bank, the responsibility for economic policy lies solely with the Member States. European economic policy must be coordinated by political power, not against the ECB, but independently of a world view that is limited solely to monetary considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a clear signal from an independent body, which decided in the European Commission’s favour with regard to its approach towards Member States exceeding the 3% standard structurally.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, the self-same Commission, albeit with a new Commissioner, is tabling a proposal for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact, the ambiguity of which will make it particularly welcome in the auditors’ offices of those governments that do not play by the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has a more intelligent application of the Pact in mind, but I wonder which definition of intelligence it is using, for since when has it been intelligent to reward infringements? Let us not make things more complicated than they already are. The Pact’s strength lies in its simplicity. Two large Member States are now seeking a solution for their economic situation in difficult times, at the expense of the Pact, and are all too pleased to take an advance on the future.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we be certain, though, that in a new system, those Member States, France and Germany, will continue to observe the agreements and above all, as Mr Klinz commented earlier, will carry out the necessary economic reforms? I totally agree with the Chairman of Ecofin that a review of the Pact could, of course, prove useful. However, whilst in the past I was a fervent advocate of a much stronger role of the Commission in enforcing the Pact, the new Commissioner will have a job persuading me that the Pact is in good hands with him. It is just as well that the Council, under the Dutch Presidency, has at least demonstrated its responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want it to be implemented in practice, so that we can keep control of public spending, combat excessive deficit and ensure sound management of Member States’ public finances. This is precisely why we support the Commission’s proposal and why we are pleased with the Council of Ministers’ positive reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking on board what has been learnt from experience, the Commission’s proposal consists, purely and simply, of making the rules of the Pact fully and intelligently enforceable, without changing the two main criteria: deficit percentage and debt percentage. The communication of 3 September builds on principles of which we approve: enabling the Commission to issue early warnings, placing the emphasis on the level of debt, establishing budget surpluses during times of economic growth to allow room for manoeuvre in times of economic slowdown – the squirrel strategy – being responsive to exceptional circumstances – a concept that the Council of Ministers should incorporate thoroughly – and, finally, coordinating the main objectives of economic policy with the decisions made in national parliaments. This proposal therefore places greater importance on economic developments and makes strenuous efforts to avoid the risks to which dogmatism is in danger of exposing business and jobs. If France can make a major contribution to growth in Europe this year, for example, it is clearly because the Pact has not been applied to it like a hatchet.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the appointment of a permanent chairman of the Eurogroup in the shape of Mr Juncker, which is a step in the right direction. In the future, budgetary policy will make a greater contribution to growth and will, accordingly, play a decisive role in achieving the Lisbon objectives, which determine the prospects for competitiveness and prosperity in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important to return to economic governance because what we are seeing now stems from the Treaty of Maastricht, when Economic and Monetary Union was decided upon: Monetary Union was defined and realised, Economic Union less so.

<p class="contents">The European Union’s capacity for creation demonstrates that those who were the exam candidates are now the most virtuous and, curiously, those who demanded virtue are the ones who have sinned most. So this gives us hope in terms of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, we have introduced the euro, we have decided upon the Lisbon strategy, we have drawn up a Constitution – I would like to point out that all the representatives of the governments went to the Convention’s working group to oppose the implementation of economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore obliged to review and update the Stability and Growth Pact, because in many respects it does not work – particularly in relation to growth – and because we have had to go to the Court of Justice to get certain States to apply it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is what justifies both the Commission’s actions – which we clearly support – and the positive reaction of the Council, because, just as the European Central Bank has to be monetarist, the Council has to concern itself with the functioning of the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Stability and Growth Pact is a requirement for justice and sustainability. It must therefore remain in existence, and its direction and application must be preserved and strengthened in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty of Maastricht and the European Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact illustrates the simple economic and fundamental truth that today’s debts always end up being tomorrow’s taxes, to be borne by future generations. The Pact therefore rightly calls for an end to state indebtedness and for a budget that is balanced across the economic cycle. Under the Pact’s rules, as has already been noted, temporary deficits can and may be tolerated during economic upturns, but during the next economic upturn these new debts must then be cleared again.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Commission communication rightly poses the question of long-term viability, and calls for better links between the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact. A critical view should however be taken with regard to an issue which is given much space in the communication, namely that of placing greater emphasis on the Commission’s recommendations on economic development. The Commission communication contains a total of five key proposals; due to a lack of time I can only evaluate one of them, the improved coordination and implementation of budgetary policy. The closer links between the Commission’s recommendations on the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact are to be welcomed, and have meant that the Commission has been able to stimulate competition among systems in the Europe of 25 and to make a major contribution to moving closer to the goals set in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore lend our unreserved support to these renewed proposals for increased transparency and accountability in the Member States’ budgetary policies, and it must be especially in the interests of all participants in the monetary union to support the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact by means of transparent data. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am quite astonished to hear it said in this House that confidence in the euro has been shaken. Where have you found even one piece of economic evidence to support such a statement? The truth is quite the opposite; the businesses with which I am in contact are more concerned at the strength of the euro against the US dollar and at the fact that we are experiencing low economic growth. The people with whom I am in contact are concerned at the high rates of unemployment in the European Union.</p>

Mr Poettering, it was with great interest that I discovered how broad a discussion is being conducted on this issue within your group. This discussion is a fascinating one, and apparently this is also the case within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is this: let us be reasonable and avoid ideology, and let us support the Commission’s ideas, which are capable of making the Pact more effective and of turning a stability procedure into a Stability and Growth Pact.

Every day we say we must implement the Lisbon Agenda, but the results are there for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The current Stability and Growth Pact, as structured, cannot provide a solution either for growth, or for the infrastructure gap or for the call for reforms. It is just a poor surrogate for a common economic and growth policy which does not exist. It was wanted by the strong countries because they did not trust the weak ones, but in the end it was the strong countries who were the first not to abide by it.</p>
<p class="contents">Something, therefore, is not working, and we have to be honest and admit it. As we all know, the three strategic objectives of growth, infrastructure and reforms can be synthesised by policy makers in a formula that economic theory calls the golden rule, which allows for intergenerational investment spending to be financed through deficit and at the same time requires current spending to be financed without generating a budget deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, European bureaucracies and governments have said no to the introduction of the golden rule for fear of opportunistic behaviour by the Member States. Such fears are correct, but Europe cannot be built on fears. To prevent national opportunism if the golden rule is implemented, it is important that there should be clear European objectives and clear European rules, as well as equally clear financing with <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> checks on its appropriateness and <span class="italic">ex-post</span> checks on the outcome, without leaving any room for accountancy tricks or bullying tactics, which have been used all too often in the recent past, even by countries considered to be hard-liners. Why not try out the golden rule? If the golden rule is not included in the Pact reforms, the ECB will be right in saying that it is better to give up and leave the Pact as it is, stupid and open to being bypassed at will by the strong, but also useless if not damaging, given that the timid interpretative corrections, sponsored by various parties, regarding the flexibility of medium-term deficits as well as the sustainability of debts are of little use.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Almunia, I wish you all the best in your work and urge you to be as courageous as necessary at such a difficult time for the integration of this Europe of ours. Do not listen to the hordes of self-interested sirens in disguise that are likely to permanently sink not only the credibility of the Pact but along with it the credibility of Europe as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would be a mistake. The Pact should be changed because it has started to contradict itself. Its mechanisms balance if the nominal growth of the economy comes to around 5%. Our potential growth in Europe is consistently below that figure, and so the Pact does not hold. If it is left like that, debt will rise as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposals are sound. They can be enhanced and strengthened in relation to Lisbon and in relation to the strengthening of European integration, which means avoiding the risk of policies breaking down at national level. If, for instance, precise mechanisms are identified to make the Pact fully and automatically cyclical, to support European investment programmes or to give set flexibility margins to countries that approach the Lisbon reforms structurally, all that would not mean making the rules less strict but making them more effective and directed towards growth and integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is fair to look more carefully at debt, not the amount of debt but its dynamics. In fact, for mathematical reasons, under equal conditions of growth and deficit reduction, a larger debt falls more rapidly, and so it is appropriate as well as fair to punish not the accumulated errors of the past but, if anything, the laxity in remedying them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I apologise for leaving earlier but the problem is that I am not only President-in-Office of the Council and Netherlands Minister of Finance, I am also replacing the Prime Minister at the moment because he is in hospital. I have many obligations to fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">After listening to all the statements it is clear that there is a wide variety of opinion in Parliament. I am not surprised by that. Maybe we can reach some consensus here. As President-in-Office of the Council I must be very careful in expressing my views because I have not had an opportunity to check whether all my 24 colleagues agree with my answers to some of the remarks made. Let me pick out a few themes.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as asked by various speakers, why did we have problems with the Pact? The basic mistake in the past has been that we did not make use the good times for consolidation. I believe that both Mr Poettering and Mr Klinz said a few words in that regard. My colleagues in France and Germany also concluded that if they had been in surplus or in balance before the downswing started, they would not have breached the 3% limit and all these troubles would not have arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that is an important consensus. Those who now criticise the Pact for its rigidity are probably not the same people who advocated more rigid consolidation in the good times. Perhaps they felt that the good times were so nice that we could spend even more than the governments planned. That is my experience, at least.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be consistent during the entire cycle. If we consolidate firmly in good times then we can be more relaxed when the economic cycle takes a downturn. Stabilisation over the entire cycle – that is one of the lessons learned.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, as I am sure you do, that we are now at the start of the upward part of the cycle. If we use that time well, the inevitable downturn will not, once again, lead us to the problems that we have previously encountered. We do not need any change to the text of the Pact in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been remarked by some speakers, the Stability and Growth Pact is not a solution to everything. We also have the Lisbon process. I do not believe that there has to be tension between the Stability Pact and the Lisbon process. Mr Schulz spoke of this tension. Personally, I do not believe that low deficits, the fact that the deficits were not high enough, are the real problem in relation to the lack of growth in Europe. We have to look at the necessary reforms and also set the right priorities in our budgets, so that we really spend the money within a budgetary framework and on the issues that are important for the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that if we were more relaxed on deficits, interest payments would gradually crowd out other expenditure, such as expenditure on R&amp;D and education, which we all want. In the medium and long term, higher deficits are certainly not a solution for any Lisbon objective. They may even conflict with the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">A few of you were a bit afraid of an ad hoc approach, that we would not apply equal treatment to all the countries based on clear criteria. We discussed that in the Council and stated that we need a rules-based system for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There were some questions about the golden rule. As such, the golden rule is a pro-cyclical system. It was used in the 19th century in many countries. I do not think it would be good for economics today.</p>
<p class="contents">Other questions were asked about the role of Mr Juncker. He will be President of the Euro Group. There are some advantages to having a longer-term president, who will also be its face <span class="italic">vis-a-vis</span> the outside world, for example in the G-7. If people see a new minister of finance come from the Euro Group every six months, it will not make a very strong impression. Such a president also organise and plan for a longer period than just six months.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the coming weeks and months we can work further on this issue. As I said, the Commission proposals are a good basis for discussion. They will probably not be accepted lock, stock and barrel, but I do not think the Commission ever expected that. We already have some basis for consensus in the paper I presented to you today. I hope that we will get full consensus on an operational Pact that is really implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in Mark Anthony’s funeral speech, he sings the praises of budgetary austerity but, at the same time, tells us that he has put in place the necessary explosives to bring down the pillars supporting it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner advocates simple rules but, at the same time, he tells us that we must take account of the national circumstances of each country, which means there will be 25 different rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What we were saying yesterday about the Stability Pact is still true today. It is absolutely true that we must maintain the austerity pact in order to maintain price stability; that budgetary austerity serves to free up resources for education, research and development in order to make the Lisbon process possible; and, above all, that it is necessary to meet the implicit, hidden, unbudgeted-for obligations resulting from the ageing of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">What we were saying yesterday is still true today. And if we are saying other things, that is simply because we are treating the Stability Pact as done for. The Stability Pact was good, the bad thing was that it was not complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, all of those who have always been in the Stability Pact are the ones who are today applauding your measures and all of us who have always been in favour of the Stability Pact are the ones who are against the Commission’s proposal for making it flexible, unequal and discretionary.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, the applause of the governments is not disinterested applause. The Stability Pact is not a pact in favour of the governments, it is a pact against governments, for restricting their action, in order not to neutralise the actions of the Central Bank and in order to maintain price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">And if it is a pact against the governments and in favour of the citizens – and in this regard I agree with what the chairperson of the committee has said – you will have the support of my group in enhancing the powers of the Commission, against the Council, and the powers of Parliament, as representative of the citizens, to defend that budgetary stability, which will provide the citizens with lower prices, lower interest rates for their mortgages and will help to guarantee that we will have resources in the future to attend to the needs of our pensioners and that we will not have squandered those resources by paying interest and paying off debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group will support the Commissioner in this debate. But if the intention is to draw up rules that make the application of the Pact discretionary, unequal and ultimately unfair, in accordance with the ‘<span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span>’ principle, the Commissioner will not have our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support the fact that, in the interests of the euro’s prestige, there should be strict framework rules for the Member States and this is why I do not agree with the weakening of the Stability Pact, or in an extreme case, its abolition. I also agree that the Commission had examined the experiences of previous years and, in the area of implementation, it foresaw more flexibility which must, however, strengthen the willingness to observe strict framework conditions. I also agree with the Commission’s approach that several views must be considered when revising the Pact, such as supportable state debt, protracted slow growth, harmonisation and co-ordination of economic and budgetary policies. One must be careful however, that for the unity of the requirements system an equal judgment must prevail. I see that as a very important criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">As for myself, I believe that it would be very complicated to work out a country-specific conditions system. Instead, one ought to concentrate on the individual characteristics of the economic situation and incorporate this into the whole system. Apart from such a characteristic as excessive indebtedness, there could be other aspects to consider such as the excessive openness and vulnerability of small countries, but, above all, the consideration of the principle according to which one of the most important aims of the Union is cohesion, that is, the joining up of less developed countries and regions that are lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly pertinent to the ten out of the twenty-five Member States, the newly-acceded states where, apart from ensuring conditions of growth, one must pay attention, when assessing the observance of the criteria, to certain reforms in public spending, such as for example the reform of the pensions system, the need for a quota of higher investment and the appearance of an occasional higher rate of inflation. But these of course, in these circumstances, are economic phenomena. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it needs amending, because it has not always been applied correctly or fairly. In some countries, the Commission has exhausted its strictness, and in others the Council has exhausted its leniency.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we must take account not only of the actual but also of the structural deficit, by overlooking short-term cyclical fluctuations in GDP. Had we done so, Germany would not have had a problem in either 2002 or 2003, or even this year, while France would have had a problem in 2002 and 2003, but not this year. A source of friction would have thus been eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that we should not overlook borrowing, but this means that we need to use the primary structural deficit; in other words, we need to subtract amortisation costs. I also agree that we need to examine the extent to which a country has exorbitant expenditure for which it alone is not responsible, as with Greece and the extraordinary spending on the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want a pact which will achieve stability in the eurozone, not unequal treatment of Member States, a pact with a long-term strategy, not knee-jerk reactions, which safeguards the Lisbon objectives without sending the economies into a vicious circle of recession.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to achieve all this, we need to clearly amend the Stability Pact, the Regulation itself, not merely hope that it will be applied better in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is easy to look back to the Seventies and see how matters were then, for at that time we had high inflation, high unemployment and governments that added to their budget deficits. Thanks to the Stability and Growth Pact, we have a common code and a common criterion that has counteracted these factors.</p>
<p class="contents">The paradox is that we are now having this debate partly because the Stability and Growth Pact has operated as it was supposed to do. It has put political pressure on those countries that increase their deficits and, for that reason, it is of interest to us all, irrespective of whether or not we have the euro or of whether or not we participate in monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic problem in the European economy, affecting the image of the Stability and Growth Pact, is that too many countries have inflexible economies that are incapable of handling the deficit situation when times are hard. In this context, I want to say that there is a direct link between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon process because we either develop flexibility in the Member States’ national economies, providing dynamism and growth, or have a more flexible interpretation of the rules, but we do not solve Europe’s problems by introducing other rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to appeal to the Commission to be objective and clear, no matter what form the criteria take. The solution does not lie in change but in reform of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially before accession, we saw the Stability Pact as a powerful and comprehensible symbol of Europe’s stability, and this was not because of its name, but thanks to its contents. It was the symbolic custodian of a healthy economy and of reliable rules and justice, for everyone and without exception.</p>
<p class="contents">I say ‘was’, because today this is no longer the case. It is a symbol which needs rehabilitating. Budgetary discipline is a political risk today for governments which have embarked on public finance reform, and yet it is of crucial importance for the stability of the entire European Union. Flexible interpretations and relativisation of the Pact are a stab in the back for these courageous governments. It is not flexible interpretations of the rules which citizens and businesses expect, but a flexible EU trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the threat posed to the EU’s internal market by the dishonest trading practices of third countries. These mean that it is important for the Commission to open negotiations with the WTO on import quotas, in particular with regard to imports from China, which disregards the social and environmental regulations of our market. A threat to three million jobs in the textile industry and women’s unemployment are at stake, which means a threat to employment stability as of January of next year. A flexible trade policy and reliable rules are conducive to stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission’s efforts to increase the transparency of rules, I believe that it will open negotiations with the WTO, and I am keeping my fingers crossed for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We start from a most regrettable situation. Non-compliance with the Pact on the part of a growing number of Member States is clearly a serious breach of good budgetary behaviour. I am not unaware of the effects of the economic situation, yet I have noticed that the Member States that have had the courage to avoid slipping into extravagant spending show indicators that are perfectly in line with the legislative provisions. The good behaviour of some is unfortunately suffering from the backsliding of others.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, let us not fall into the traps either of blind devotion or of dogmatism. The future ex-President of the Commission, moreover, did not hide his feelings on the Pact, using extremely undiplomatic language. I find the guidelines set out by the Commission interesting because they could lead to a less simplistic understanding of Member States’ public finances. Therein, however, lie further difficulties: how can we reconcile an understanding of the complex and unique situations of each Member State with maintaining rules that are clear, understandable and applicable across the board? I wish all the best to those who will have to undertake the task, including my compatriot, the future President of the Council and the future ‘Mr Euro’, who is well known for unravelling the most complex problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the crisis that we are enduring is highly symptomatic of the way in which the EU operates. Nobody would deny that the EU is a community governed by the rule of law, yet it is clear that the power to exert force over the Member States quickly comes up against its limits. Overall, the dilemma is a tough one: rather than witness the slow death of the Stability and Growth Pact, I would prefer to see its regeneration, given that its demise would also have incalculable repercussions for the euro and that I still set some store by the value of the currency and of the money in my wallet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in my view, in the current situation a revision of the Pact should not be contemplated, because certain states chronically fail to observe the existing criteria and a growing number of states may well fail to observe them in the future. Nor does the inadequate penalty regime serve to encourage the maintenance of budgetary and fiscal discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed reforms give a dangerous signal to market forces about inability to control the situation even in the long term. That is why I cannot support the proposed reforms, especially those relating to anchoring the budget deficit level and the different deadlines allowed to Member States for eliminating excessive deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary and fiscal policy are particularly sensitive areas of political responsibility. Any exceptions in these areas will inevitably tend to be never-ending. Of concern is the proposal for an extended period of weak economic growth, which would in effect offer a limitless time for those politicians who are unable or do not want to undertake structural reforms in their countries. A relaxation of the rules will not motivate politicians to undertake unpopular reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the proposal for country-specific adjustment paths for correction of excessive budget deficits is of special concern. These specific adjustment paths for various countries may prove to be not simply specific but also significantly different, because transparency in these matters is hard to ensure. That would lead to a loss of confidence in the Pact as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All these contributions will be extremely useful for me as I carry out my future duties as Commissioner responsible, insofar as it falls to me, for carrying out this adaptation and improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact and of economic governance in general, and they seem to me extremely useful in terms of communicating arguments and objectives on such an important issue as the economy of the Member States of the Union and of the European Union as a whole from Parliament to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say once again – I have done so in my initial speech and it has been said in several of your speeches, but I want to repeat it in this final speech – that the Treaty is not in question, nor what the Treaty says about public finances and about budgetary stability. The limit of 3% of GDP for the public deficits of the Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union and the limit of 60%, in relation to GDP, for public debt remain in force. The countries that are not complying with these limits are obliged to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">They do not remain in force for no good reason, but because one of the objectives of the Economic and Monetary Union must continue to be budgetary stability as a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>condition for the effectiveness of the extremely important political decision we took when launching the Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, the creation of the single currency. And it is still necessary to preserve the objective of budgetary stability and those reference values by means of the system of rules – as has been said on many occasions during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must also be aware that the ultimate objective of the Economic and Monetary Union, of the budgetary stability of economic policies, is to guarantee more growth and well-being for some of our citizens. And some of you have expressed the opinion that the debate on the reform of the pact could even in some way affect the stability of our currency, the euro. I do not believe that is the case if the debate is held within the limits we have set for it as in the Council last weekend and as in this debate today in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been discussed is the fact that the eurozone and the European Union as a whole are growing less than other areas of the world. We have more stability, thanks to the decisions we have taken within the framework of the Economic and Monetary Union, but we have less growth. And that is a response we must find not only through the instrument of the Stability and Growth Pact, but also by rereading it, revising it and adapting it, introducing more economic rationality into it, taking account of the heterogeneous nature of the European Union of 25 following enlargement, taking account of the fact that the Treaty also talks about the need to preserve the sustainability of public finances and not just of preserving and ensuring budgetary balance in each financial year, by monitoring public deficit, and bearing in mind that, over the years the Stability and Growth Pact has been applied, its credibility has suffered because the rules in force have not always been adopted and applied by the institution which must ultimately do so, which is the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore strengthen the pact, the framework for budgetary surveillance and our instruments for economic governance. And how must we do this? With more flexibility or more rigour? With both things.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain respects, we must be more flexible, because experience shows us that the room for manoeuvre, which a reasonable interpretation of the rules we decided upon allows us, is not sufficient to take account of very powerful arguments arising from economic rationality, from the specific situation of the economy of the country at a particular time. And in other respects we must be more rigorous, such as in our surveillance of the evolution of levels of public debt or in the mechanisms for application of the Pact for example, both in the preventive part and in the corrective part of the Pact, in the excessive deficit mechanism. We must take account of the economic cycle, preserve equality of treatment for each and every country – and this is a task the Commission identifies itself with in particular – and ensure better compliance. And we must link the Pact better with the other instruments of economic governance – as many speakers have said this afternoon – the Lisbon Agenda and the economic growth objectives in order to make the European Union’s Economic and Monetary Union the most competitive area in the world and, at the same time, the most socially cohesive and the most sustainable from an environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this require a debate? The Commission believes this is obvious. Should this debate take place within a certain limits? Of course, and that is established in the Commission's Communication. Must we seek agreement and the greatest possible degree of consensus in our dialogue and cooperation with the Council? I believe this is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate – and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said this as well – must lead us, and I trust that it will lead us, in November, on the second analysis by Ecofin of the adaptation and improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact, to a level of agreement and consensus between the Member States, at Council level, and between the Council and the Commission, which is even greater than the very considerable level of agreement demonstrated last weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes to the rules will be necessary, as few as possible. In any event, the touchstone of the discussion must not be whether or not an article, an item or a paragraph of a regulation should be changed. The touchstone will be whether the reason why it has become necessary to change that regulation has been agreed, is reasonable and is in accordance with our objectives of budgetary stability, of maintaining a framework for fiscal and economic governance and of that framework preserving the stability and growth of the European Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, a comment on the issue often mentioned in many speeches from France and Germany. The judgment of the Court of Justice of 13 July basically considered the European Commission to be right. The Council was not entitled to act as it did last November. We must now apply the Treaty, as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The Council has no choice but to respect the Commission’s right to initiative. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and must therefore ensure compliance with the rules of the Treaties and their implementation by means of the Stability and Growth Pact in force and we are committed to doing this and we are going to act on the basis of the judgement of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">What action are we going to take? We are following the development of the public finances of many Member States very closely, but in particular that of France and Germany during 2004, and the budgets that each of the two governments are beginning to draw up and which they will communicate for discussion to their parliaments in the coming months, before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of October, when we will know the content of the budgetary policies formally announced by the two governments and while we await the final decision of their respective parliaments, the Commission will publish its estimate and economic forecasts and we will estimate how public debt in France and Germany may develop in 2004 – we could practically give an accurate estimate now, but I would prefer to wait until October – and our estimate for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Commission’s economic forecasts and with the precise information we will have in the weeks following the publication of those assessments of the real and concrete content of the budgetary policies agreed by both of those countries for 2005, the Commission, employing its right to initiative and carrying out its duty fully, will tell the Council what its proposal is. The Council will have to take the appropriate decisions, of course, in a climate of cooperation, but naturally with the greatest respect for the principles and rules laid down in the Treaties and in the regulations in force in the field of budgetary stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the core of the Pact should remain intact, namely maximum 3% of GDP for budget shortage and 60% of GDP for public debt. If the Pact is to become more flexible, this should be done on the basis of objective and general criteria. This is where the proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should have more powerful means at its disposal to force Member States to adhere to the terms of the Pact. At the moment, the Council has too many fingers in the pie, which leads to a politicisation of the Stability Pact. The sanction mechanism in the present Stability Pact did not appear to be rock-hard or neutral: large Member States, on the basis of their position of power, were able to violate the rules and get away with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the present Pact does not conclusively specify that in times of economic prosperity its members have to work on building up a surplus, that is essential if the Stability Pact is to be successful. The creation of such a buffer, for example, with a view to an increase in the ageing population, is indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission underlines the importance of such a buffer in the revised Pact. At the same time, with the 3% limit, in principle, the Pact offers Member States enough leeway to invigorate their economy in times of economic decline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
