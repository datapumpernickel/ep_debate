We support the Commission's proposals, since the reform is in line with the thinking behind Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed that the wine sector should become more market‐oriented, so as to achieve a better balance in future between supply and demand. The proposed arrangements therefore mean an adaptation of the market, which in turn means reorganisation and bans on replanting of wine areas in certain regions, together with the abolition of artificial outlets for products that cannot be sold on the market. This avoids surplus production, which is marketed at prices far below the costs of production and distillation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Martin report paves the way for a dilution of the Commission's proposals by retaining part of the distillation arrangements, which the Commission proposes should be abolished, and imposing longer timescales for the individual objectives, and this we cannot endorse.</p>

<p class="contents">During the debate on the Martin report in the House, Commissioner Fischler made a speech in which he expressed views that were contrary to the interests of French and European wine growing.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the ban on importing musts from third countries for wine making, Commissioner Fischler said that he disagreed with the European Parliament"s position, basing his argument on the WTO agreements and stating that suitable ‘labelling" regulations would be introduced. The amendment as adopted in the report reflects the very same current legislation that was consolidated in the GATT. Our group does not, therefore, understand Commissioner Fischler"s views and is opposed to the introduction of specific labels for wines made from musts imported from third countries. The wine will be promoted according to where it is made, so the final product will have the designation of origin of the place where the wine was made, in line with the GATT agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as planting rights are concerned, the Commissioner says that he still favours limiting the growth of European vineyards to 1 % in the 2000‐2010 period. The European Parliament wanted 3 % growth in order to enable vineyards with structural problems to adapt to their market without relocating from regions of production where the product is less highly valued.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the restructuring of vineyards, the Commissioner said that he was in favour of this measure because it fulfilled the objective of quality. Nevertheless, he remains opposed to our proposals on the regeneration of vineyards and the improvement of wine‐making facilities. Once again, the Commission"s approach is too restrictive and does not embrace the real economic situation of the wine‐making industry. What is the use of altering the quantity of vine stocks in a production region without altering its winemaking facilities? How do we plan to alter the vine stocks in an area of designated origin? The Commission"s proposal is therefore going to limit the qualitative improvements of the qwpsr and table wines with geographic designation. I must point out that these are products that are exported by the European Union and that therefore contribute both to the development of rural regions and to the balance of trade in the wine‐producing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the promotion measures, the Commissioner stated that they would be subject to a horizontal regulation, that is, one that is valid for all so‐called quality agricultural and food products. I must point out that only eight of the European Union"s fifteen Member States produce wine. It is highly probable that of the financial resources to be used for this horizontal regulation, the majority will be used for agricultural and food products that are produced in all the Member States of the European Union, such as milk products and meat products.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I was pleased to note that the Commissioner took account of all the amendments tabled by Parliament on trade organisations. In France, we are aware of the fundamental role of professional organisations. They need to have a legal status that is specified in Community law in order to ensure that they are not called into question by the non‐producing Member States on the premise of the single market and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member from the Languedoc‐Roussillon region, I welcome the fact that we were able to reintroduce the definition of natural sweet wines into the Commission"s proposal. However, I regret the fact that certain French pressure groups wanted to remove this definition, purely for tax reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I was pleased to see that some of our proposals were taken over by the Commissioner. However, once again, all the measures that we envisaged in relation to revitalising supply and demand, with regard to both the single market and third countries, have been rejected by the European Commission. I must point out that the European Union is the world leader in terms of wine making, and alone accounts for 80 % of world trade in this sector. Rather than trying to preserve this dominant position on the world market, the Commission is taking an approach that puts constraints on the European wine‐making industry.</p>

This reform is essential and aims to adapt the sector to the current situation and to the high degree of competition in the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to establish a better and more complete system of Community aid and support for those wine‐growing zones that are both in crisis and expanding, due, for the most part, to increasing competition from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission must provide greater protection for quality wine through the designations of origin system both within the EU itself and in international agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A comprehensive policy to combat the crisis in the wine sector must aim to ensure that vineyards do not relocate to areas receiving EU subsidies. In this respect, the Commission must allow the sector to be cofinanced at national level. Moreover, we must not consider wines made with grapes from third countries to be Community wines, as the Commission proposes, since they would therefore be eligible for subsidies. It is also essential to increase to 3 % the area for new planting up to 2010.</p>

Moreover, support for wine amounts to an irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money, which not infrequently is actually embezzled. In spite of this, it is proposed to increase the support from around EUR 1.1 billion per annum to around EUR 1.3 bn – i.e. from some SEK 10 bn to SEK 12 bn a year!</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this form of organised swindle involving EU funds should be phased out as quickly as possible. Wine is not a foodstuff, but a luxury item which should be subjected to the laws of the marketplace without any further intervention from central authorities – apart from any steps that might be justified for reasons of alcohol policy, but these would need to be effected at Member State level, not EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">If, for social reasons, the wine‐growing countries wish to support their growers, then of course they have every right to do so, but to make taxpayers contribute in this way, over and above what they pay to purchase the wine, is nothing short of grotesque. It is hard to imagine a more flagrant example of misdirected pseudo‐solidarity than support for wine. We are in favour of genuine international solidarity, including increased foreign aid. This is one of the reasons why we have voted against the report as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents">The important thing is to preserve wine production in Europe, attaching special priority to quality products. In particular, it will be essential to safeguard the diversity of traditional production methods, many of which go back thousands of years. That is why it is incomprehensible that some of my fellow Members keep trying to fan the flames of north‐south discord over winemaking processes. The north does not find fault with southern production methods, so the MEPs from southern climes should not oppose typically northern methods either.</p>
<p class="contents">The message here is ‘Live and let live".</p>
<p class="contents">Wine is a natural product which, taken regularly and in moderation, is beneficial to health. This has been proved by a number of scientific analyses. I should like to refer in this context to a recent study conducted by the University of Mainz, which clearly demonstrates that daily consumption of one to three glasses of wine protects the heart and reduces the risk of coronary thrombosis.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it would be appropriate to advertise these findings as part of a series of large‐scale European wine campaigns. Initiatives to this end should be supported by the European Commission. They would also serve to refute explicitly the recurrent false reports according to which the Commission intends to prohibit the advertising of alcoholic products.</p>

In 1962, for example, a set of market regulations for wine was adopted and remained in force until 1970. Then came new market regulations for wine, but these were originally devised for France, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg only. The accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain made the problems greater, and as time went by we had a growing surplus of table wines which had to be brought under control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Martin report is therefore of great importance to Luxembourg wine growers too. Who does not remember the epic discussions on the two wine reports by our honourable colleagues Mateo Sierra and Julio Fantuzzi? Two worlds were pitted against each other – the wine‐growing areas of the south and those of the north. Although the Fantuzzi report was adopted by a slender majority, it did not attract majority support in the Council of Agriculture Ministers. The Moselle and our winegrowers once more emerged relatively unscathed, because the Commission's pessimistic forecasts of wine production and consumption proved to be inaccurate.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost five years after the Fantuzzi report, Parliament has to deal again with a proposal from the Commission on the common organisation of the market in wine. And at this point I should like to congratulate Mr Martin as a specialist in this field for the good report he has tabled, and especially for its fairness. In the expectation that the report will achieve a majority in both Parliament and the Council this time, let me say that the compromise amendments he has tabled will enable the wine growers of the northern vineyard regions to go on producing their quality wines just as they always have done.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I believe that the production of quality wines in the European Union falls under national jurisdiction by virtue of the subsidiarity principle, and that Luxembourg still produces some of the best of those wines.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim must be to achieve a decrease in the production of table wine and to prevent the importation of must from non‐EU countries. Above all, there must be a reduction in large‐scale distillation, in other words the organised destruction of wine, before it reaches the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore be voting for Mr Martin's report, and I do so in the hope that producers in all wine‐growing areas will be spared any further rules and regulations in future.</p>

This is due to the professional experience of the rapporteur, combined with the best possible knowledge of the subject that came from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, and the study carried out on the ground by the writers of the report, on the basis of contributions from producers and in close cooperation with our Directorate‐General for Research.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate brings to light several fundamental points, dealing with both the nature of the common agricultural policy and the actual running of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the centre of our concerns is the desire to clearly affirm that wine is an agricultural product and not an industrial one. It is essential to take this position, as it conveys the need to maintain a genuine, close and rigorous link – not only in terms of marketing – between the land and the product. It also implies the desire to encourage the promotion of products on the basis of the place of production. Respecting this link between the land and the product is essential to ensure consumer safety. It is a necessary condition for the future of food safety, and also for the possibility of maintaining balanced land‐use planning. It enables us to prevent destructive concentrations and to continue to develop the production of food from the land, which is part of our culture.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain this link, we must prevent the development of a dangerous shift, that is, the possibility of making wine from musts imported from third countries. Our colleague Mr Chesa, who comes from one of the most important wine‐making regions in Europe, rightly highlighted the risks of a reduction in quality and of breaking the link between product and land that this move would entail.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has proposed banning wine making with musts from third countries. However, Commissioner Fischler argued that this position was not well‐founded, considering that the provisions of the Marrakesh agreement establishing the WTO no longer allowed the countries of the European Union to declare such a ban. We in turn contest Mr Fischler"s interpretation, as the proposals in the Martin report merely take up the exact provisions of the COM in wine which are consolidated in the GATT. I have, moreover, addressed a written question to the Commission on this fundamental point, and this must be clarified quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than taking the relevant step of encouraging the development of a sector in which European countries are world leaders, the Commission has adopted a Malthusian, restrictive and cautious attitude towards several issues. Fortunately, the Martin report deliberately breaks away from this philosophy by rightly proposing a controlled restructuring and regeneration of vineyards and measures to improve the quality of grapes and wine‐making facilities. It also gives priority to structural measures to help and support young people when they are setting up their operations and as they expand.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Martin report quite rightly requests that the Council"s authority and rights be entirely preserved in this important sector, while the Commission proposed, as usual, an excessive increase in its own powers, claiming that it alone held all the powers of modification and regulation. We can only hope that the Council, which is the only European institution that has real democratic legitimacy, will be able to resist the pressure from the Commission.</p>

I think reform of the organisation of the market in wine must essentially respect the following principles: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Although market regulation mechanisms are needed to balance supply and demand, the Commission is not justified in extending the ban on new planting up to 2010 while permitting wine making from imported musts. While other world wine producers have a free hand, this restriction represents a serious threat to the Union"s dominant position on the world market, where Europe currently accounts for over 50 % of total production.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Maintaining the status quo on enrichment with sucrose to obtain the final alcohol content of wines is unacceptable. This kind of regulation would hinder the development of markets like Italy"s which focus on alcohol produced in vineyards rather than cellars. The significant cost‐savings achieved by the simple addition of sugars would make quality production, like Italy's, barely viable and condemn it to a niche position on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ I also think it is important to regularise the position of the Italian vineyards planted without formally respecting Community regulations, and I reject the Commission"s idea of deducting these from the new planting reserve. In fact, if the Commission's approach were accepted, Italy would be at a distinct disadvantage compared with Spain, which currently meets the provisions in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Finally, under Commission Decision No 94/173/EC of 22 March 1994, the wine‐growing sector should be included amongst those benefiting from aid for product transformation and processing. If Italian cellars cannot access European aid to invest in production technology it will be impossible to improve the quality of their products and entrepreneurs boasting one of the oldest wine‐making traditions in Europe, who accept the market logic of product improvement and are counting on penetrating the upper segments of the market, will be penalised.</p>

It has not come too soon.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue was deliberately avoided at Maastricht so as to facilitate the Treaty"s ratification, and again at Amsterdam, so as not to open debates that might have led to doubts among the citizens on the eve of the single currency"s entry into force. Nevertheless, we are faced with the issue now and we must face up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barros Moura report opens up several debates, but by no means all the debates. For example, it does not thoroughly examine the issue of the democratic control of the single currency, as this issue seems practically impossible to solve. It also fails to consider the issue of who will make the ultimate decision on external exchange rates, because it is such a contentious issue at present. And even though it mentions the need for a federal‐style budgetary system, it fails to specify what this means in terms of new taxes and the rates they would be set at.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, what does this report actually deal with? Essentially, it deals with the coordination of economic policies which it would like to see extended to other related areas, such as structural policies. This is something it would like to see become more centralised, to the Commission"s advantage, and more binding, along with the obligatory decisions taken by a qualified majority. The socialist leanings of the rapporteur, who views all solutions in terms of a superstate, are clearly evident in all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Liberal colleagues appear somewhat taken aback by this prospect, and yet the result was obvious. It is true that the choice has still not been formally announced between socialist or Liberal‐style euro management institutions, but, in short, that choice has been largely predetermined. The single currency is in itself a unifying and rigid principle, something our Liberal friends seem to have realised a little too late.</p>

We believe that there is good reason to highlight the need for an effective consensus with regard to the policy on EMU and other policy areas, such as employment and social policy, the overall macroeconomic policy and environmental policy. We also believe that there is good reason to highlight the need for political control over the ECB within the framework of the independence demanded by its operations. The enlargement of the EU compels us to pay greater attention to these questions, a point which is also emphasised in the committee's proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we feel that in several instances the committee's proposals run the risk of tackling the issues from the wrong starting‐point. The development of increased coordination between policies relating to EMU – above all employment and social policies, overall macroeconomic policy and environmental policy – should be based on more active initiatives and more closely coordinated objectives in these areas, rather than on static demands for changes in the Council's decision‐making procedures and the introduction of binding rules. In our opinion, it is essential above all that the Community should increase its efforts to achieve more active employment and social policies and better coordination of overall macroeconomic policy. We believe that increased efforts cannot in all respects be driven primarily by institutional changes in the way that is proposed by the committee. In our view, this is a valid position even in the context of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are of the opinion that changes in the rules for making decisions on economic policy should be based on clear definitions of which areas of the Member States' current economic policy would be affected. We believe that some of the proposals for institutional changes that are being submitted by the committee do not take into account this need for clear definitions. One example of these essentially unclear definitions is the committee's paragraph 18 on ‘federal‐style" budgetary systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the committee's proposal of a legal basis in the Treaty for the Euro Council, we believe that this fails to take into account the fact that EMU should be seen as a matter for all EU countries, even those which are not currently taking part in the euro. EMU and the common currency have an impact on large areas of Community policy and should therefore not be a matter that is handled exclusively by the Euro Council, as envisaged in the proposal put forward by the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">This consideration has guided us in the position we have adopted on individual points in the report and the individual amendments that have been tabled. The fact that the report as a whole contains certain weaknesses does not mean that we believe it should be rejected in its entirety. The relationship between EMU policy and other policy areas and the consequences of enlargement for EMU are so important that this matter warrants further attention.</p>

Consequently, the next logical and inevitable step – if a breakdown of the monetary union project is to be avoided – is to establish a real federal structure. Amongst other things, this means giving more power to the Commission and the European Parliament and less power, first and foremost, to the national parliaments. At the same time, majority votes will be the norm. There will be a common economic policy and a common tax policy. In addition, a ‘federal‐style" budgetary system will be created – a budget that will be used to resolve crisis situations in the individual Member States. To put it more directly: the report is canvassing for the establishment of a federal state with a federal budget at its disposal, similar to the federal system that exists in federal states such as Germany and the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">As a counterbalance to EMU, the report wishes to create a social and political union. The establishment of a social union will mean that a framework will be created at EU level for the way in which social security benefits and schemes are to be administered. The Union will establish parameters for determining who is entitled to benefit from the social security system, how much they are able to receive and how the benefits and schemes are to be financed. We do not share the Barros Moura report's vision of a federal EU, and we are therefore voting against the report.</p>

It was not an end in itself, but simply one stage further along the road to European integration. The launch of the euro provides the Union with a single monetary policy which makes it necessary to restore some kind of balance, particularly in the economic sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB, among other institutions, now performs all of its tasks with full independence, which is certainly a positive thing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the absence of a genuine political authority in economic matters at the European Central Bank clearly places the issue of the lack of democratic accountability in European integration at the centre of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It also gives rise to the fear of an uncompromising monetarist policy which would govern the Union"s strategic choices and be a burden for potentially healthy economic growth which is able to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordinating economic policies becomes a pressing need if we wish to promote an efficient and competitive European economy, which – as our resolution states – is also able to generate jobs, solidarity, economic and social cohesion and equal opportunities between citizens of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to attain this, we now need to openly declare our commitment to an economic and social union as well as to define a new ‘social contract" that establishes the common principles in social matters. However, this will not be possible if the development of an integrated economic policy is not accompanied by closer alignment of Member States" tax systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I very broadly share the conclusions reached in the resolution we are considering. I will support it all the more as it highlights the need to strengthen Parliament"s role in all matters concerning Economic and Monetary Union.</p>

Decisions on economic policy, as well as interest and exchange rates, become an EU‐only affair. In the long term, fiscal and financial policy will be decided at Union level too. A whole raft of reports from the European Parliament confirms this trend.</p>
<p class="contents">EMU is an economic and political project – the cornerstone of a future EU state. This report admittedly takes a relatively softly‐softly approach, but the underlying message is there. Economic policies are described in terms of ‘issues of common interest". The report speaks of approximation of fiscal and social policy, more qualified majority voting and a stronger Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur calls for ‘conclusion of the draft interinstitutional agreement on the coordination of national economic policies and on monitoring the stability and growth pact". Such measures would only increase the power of the EU and widen the democratic deficit. I therefore voted against this report.</p>

<p class="contents">EMU as an enterprise is fundamentally undemocratic.

Although we have a single European market, a European currency and a European monetary policy, we have no equivalent instruments of political union. There is not even an effective European exchange‐rate policy at the present time which could position the euro strategically in relation to the other currencies of the world, especially the dollar. To prevent any misunderstandings, let me stress here that such a policy would have to be based on cooperation; it must not mean an intensification of unbridled competition through government interference. This lopsidedness that market radicalism has inflicted on the European integration process must be rapidly rectified as a matter of urgency. We need a Community exchange‐rate policy that is worthy of the name, a binding ‘monetary dialogue" among the Community institutions, European economic governance as the basis of a Community macroeconomic policy, and the effective development of Community policies and of coordination between the Member States' policies in key areas such as taxation in the single market, employment and the establishment of the social and environmental conditions in which fair competition can take place within the European single market. These are the things we need in order to build up the general economic momentum that will drive us towards the goal of sustainable economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the effective new level of supranational and global interconnection in the business world, the EU, in pursuing its goal, will always have to present a united front to the international community. But we can and we must make the first move here.</p>

<p class="contents">No other European institution has achieved such status, neither the European Parliament, which is still considered to be a lower House, nor, of course, the Commission, which is considered to be a mere collection of civil servants. In the very interests of Europe, attention must be focused on the most legitimate institution. Therefore, the Council must be granted the right to propose legislation and exercise control over the Commission, even censure it. Also, decisions must be taken unanimously for all major issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Bourlanges report asserts that ‘unanimity is an arrangement fundamentally inappropriate to effective decision‐making ". In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur presents some gloomy calculations showing that with 15 players, the probability of achieving a unanimous position is one in 32 769. This is quite clearly wrong, because in today"s Europe, a great many decisions are taken every day by general consensus. In fact, the system of unanimous voting forces each partner to respect the point of view of others and endeavour to understand that point of view in order to negotiate better. The decisions taken as a result are more valid because they are based on mutual consensus. It seems as though this system is perhaps somewhat slower than others that are more authoritarian in nature, but it nonetheless produces good results. An enlarged Europe with 25 or 30 members should be able to operate in this way. We also reminded you, through an amendment, that the Luxembourg compromise should be incorporated into all parts of the Treaty. Unfortunately, that amendment was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we have to accept that a Europe with 25 members cannot be monolithic and must obey the model of variable geometry. All of these measures, including the variable geometry which will make decisions on European cooperation more flexible, will strengthen the link between Europe and its nations.</p>

The report is therefore a welcome initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not however agree with the rapporteur"s proposals on the common and foreign security policy, the CFSP. Our view is that the Council plays – and should continue to play – a central role with regard to the EU and the CFSP. We would refer to the political spirit underpinning Article J.7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, where it is stated that the Council shall be responsible for decisions in all areas affecting the Union"s security. The rapporteur"s paragraphs 10, 13 and 14 are not acceptable in the light of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the concept of positive abstention could be of assistance in fulfilling the Petersberg tasks (humanitarian intervention, and peacekeeping and peacemaking measures). In our view, however, political will alone can equip the EU to be more active in crisis management. The outcome will hinge on how the new decision‐making procedures work out in practice. We cannot therefore support paragraphs 30 and 31.</p>

Without prejudice to the future of the Community institutions, this text provides a particularly interesting basis for an excellent debate and, moreover, is proof of the maturity of this House, if indeed that still needed to be demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the comments made about the Council, I share the rapporteur"s concerns and cannot imagine enlargement ever taking place without there first being a thorough reform of the present decision‐making process. My greatest fear is to see a paralysed European Union and one that is incapable of giving impetus to a clear policy. Faced with the challenges of the next millennium, we need a Council that is capable of setting out Europe"s central themes. I also think that the ability to do this is fundamentally incompatible with the present system of the rotating presidency, which is why the question raised by Jean‐Louis Bourlanges regarding the Council"s powers is important, even if it is difficult to answer.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the way in which the Council of Ministers currently operates, and following the rapporteur"s example, I am actively campaigning for a rehabilitation of its role: in my view, it must be the Union"s driving force. Contrary to the report, I would prefer to see the various ministers for European affairs engage in closer coordination with a view to achieving greater consistency in national and European policies. In accordance with the agenda, the relevant minister should be in charge of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the system of procedures and, more specifically, the general principle of qualified majority voting, I believe that this system should be extended. I am not opposed to the principle of the double majority, which to me seems more fair and legitimate than the present weighting system.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I also think that we need to begin debating the powers of the future European Commission within the context of the Union"s enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like, once again, to stress that enlargement cannot take place without there first being a change in the present institutional framework. This prerequisite is not, in my view, designed to hinder the process but, on the contrary, aims to establish the foundations of a political Europe that is able to take responsibility for the choices it makes.</p>

Without such reform, successive enlargements will paralyse this central decision‐making organ.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussion on this report, my concern – in thinking about European citizens – was to extract clear principles from the recitals which will push the European project towards the objectives of our efforts and proposals. In my opinion, this project is inextricably linked to an increased democratisation based on the principle of majority voting, the political accountability of the authorities, scrutiny on the part of parliamentary institutions and the transparency of decision‐making procedures. The Union must progress towards a model which clearly reveals its dual nature as a union between Member States on the one hand, and as a union between peoples on the other. In this model, the Commission will become a genuine European executive, with Parliament representing the people and the Council representing the Member States. This model of Europe will be able to act as an integrated whole, which is both coherent and united, thereby increasing its international influence.</p>
<p class="contents">As this is an own‐initiative report from the European Parliament, my second concern relates to both the principle behind the report and the time chosen to adopt it. Generally speaking, I appreciate the efforts made by Jean‐Louis Bourlanges and, in particular, his attention to detail in the proposals. However, I think that until the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified and implemented by the Member States, it would often be appropriate to leave to the future negotiators the job of putting forward specific rules and limiting our role to simply announcing the general guidelines we are to follow. In this way, we can be justified in our desire to see the double majority adopted in the long term, as this is a guideline that the vast majority of the House can ratify. But we will not go into detail regarding percentages here, as these should be studied at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to note that the rapporteur had recommended that the weighting system be maintained until this double majority is adopted. However, it would perhaps be somewhat restrictive and ill‐advised to suggest that current percentages must be maintained. The most important thing is for the principle of equilibrium to be maintained, chiefly between the larger and smaller countries. We should by all means clearly specify a guideline – maintaining equilibrium – but try to prevent divisions emerging by beginning a debate on quantification.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards qualified majority voting, in the majority of cases, Jean‐Louis Bourlanges" intention to withdraw the resources that belong to the cases that are excluded from this type of majority gives rise to concern. Parliament already gave its opinion on this matter when it examined the Méndez de Vigo‐Tsatsos report – a report which expressed a balanced opinion and which was approved by the broad majority of Members – by making an exception of constitutional and ‘semi‐constitutional" matters in terms of qualified majority voting. In my opinion, it would not be wise to go back on this agreement at the present time, even if the term ‘semi‐constitutional" poses a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of foreign policy, we are waiting for the Amsterdam Treaty to be both ratified and implemented before deciding whether or not to reject the idea of ‘positive abstention". I think that opinions on this are divided, even within the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to briefly sum up the approach that I advocate. At the present moment in time, we simply express the principles that guide us, which essentially means our desire to keep the balance, but we avoid discussing details that might divide us. This approach is similar to the ‘culture of minorities", which leads to respect for others and rejects the abuse of dominant positions.</p>

Any further enlargements are likely to hamper a system which, in its time, has proved its worth, but which was never designed to function with 15 members and less still with 20 or 25 members.</p>
<p class="contents">Before any further accession takes place, European institutions must be reformed, including the Council, which has become tangled up in the growing multiplicity of its organs and takes more and more liberties with procedures that had, however, been determined in the Treaties. This is clearly an unacceptable situation. I fully share the rapporteur"s conclusions, particularly where he affirms the need for a thorough reorganisation of the Council"s structure and role, as well as the need to rationalise and consolidate procedures with a view to making it more efficient and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I lay great emphasis on the role the rapporteur would like to see conferred on both the President of the Commission and the High Representative for the CFSP, instead of and in place of a Council presidency that is forced to concentrate on its conciliation duties. This effectively implies a new division of tasks that is likely to give fresh impetus to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I fully approve of the idea that qualified majority voting should become the general procedure for decision‐making in the Council. Unanimous voting would then become the exception, its use only justified on the grounds of the seriousness and importance of a few rare decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I think that any future change to the weighting of votes needs to retain the present principle of the relative over‐representation of Member States with small and medium‐sized populations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to highlight the quality and importance of the work carried out by the rapporteur in the hope of helping European institutions to cope with the challenges they have yet to meet and overcome.</p>

<p class="contents">1. I do not believe that Parliament should get involved in the Council"s internal procedures as the Council has nothing to do with Parliament"s.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Contrary to the rapporteur"s wishes as set out in paragraph 1, I believe that we would be ill‐advised to make a distinction between the national and legislative role of ministers, as this might lead to calls for the creation of a new institution, such as a senate, which we do not need.</p>
<p class="contents">3. I do not approve of the high‐profile role the rapporteur confers on the European Council, as it is a role that appears to result from a very centralised and radical approach to politics.</p>
<p class="contents">4. I do not share the rapporteur"s scepticism concerning the rotating presidency. I cannot accept his proposal to hand over the tasks of Union leadership to the President of the Commission. On the contrary, I think that the presidency, with its enhanced responsibilities, has a significant effect on the attitude of each Member State towards the process of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">5. This report once again raises the problem of small and large European countries in the context of the weighting of votes in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I was extremely pleased to note the reasonable and well‐thought out approach taken by the rapporteur on this issue and his rejection of the popularity‐seeking attitude shown by the larger Member States. It is an attitude that comes from an unfounded fear of being dwarfed by a coalition of less populated states.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do is to find a way of preventing a deadlock in the key areas of common legislation and extending the use of qualified majority voting. However, we must not lose sight of the fundamental principle of the partnership between small, medium and large states, formed on the basis of mutual confidence and equality; it is a principle that is all too often forgotten today.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would wonder about the status of this text. If it intends to establish Parliament"s position for subsequent negotiations, it is somewhat premature, but if it aims to launch the debate, it is welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">For once, I shall abstain from voting. I do not oppose the report, because it is both detailed and interesting. However, if I voted in favour of it, I would feel that I was making a definitive decision about a matter that has yet to be debated and that will surely evolve.</p>

What more blatant admission could there be that, for federalists, European democracy is now an objective, rather than a path to achieving a goal?</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed the situation we are faced with because of the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty which is building a European superstate at the cost of a real decline in democracy. On the one hand, it is destroying the national democratic area, excluding national parliaments, and making national law – including constitutional law – subordinate to Community law. On the other hand, it is proving incapable, for the time being, of establishing the slightest democracy at European level, quite simply because the European people do not exist. What is more, the transposition of parliamentary procedures into this House only manages to produce joint positions that are all too often artificial and that are only ever accorded secondary importance by the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that, in spite of all of these diversions, genuine democracy remains the ultimate goal. I, however, have my doubts about this. Once antidemocratic institutions that are allowed to be strengthened without impunity are established, a return to control by the citizens can no longer take place spontaneously and painlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of its good intentions, the Gutiérrez Díaz report exacerbates the situation by proposing that all the rights conferred on citizens by membership of the European Union be brought within the ambit of a specific Treaty title on ‘citizens" rights". It is to be noted that this aim appears very similar to that of the German Presidency, which has proposed to create a ‘charter of fundamental rights" for the post‐Amsterdam period.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is a guideline that would bypass national democracies even further and restrict their legitimate role as a pillar of the Union. It is indeed this role that we wish to preserve instead, so that democracy and respect for the people are always present in the life of the Community.</p>

Therefore, it is, in fact, vital that the Union"s citizens do not perceive the various stages in European integration simply as an accumulation of ethereal texts, but as something tangible and meaningful for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right to lay particular emphasis on the practical provisions that have resulted from the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty. So surely the free movement of people is thus a tangible way for everyone to assess the reality of the Union in a positive manner. On the contrary, the insecurity associated with organised crime which, to a certain extent, is also a result of the removal of internal borders, generates a very negative image of European integration in the eyes of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it would be irresponsible of us to lead citizens to believe that it is possible to simply remove internal borders in Europe without there being any negative effects, something that the rapporteur does not do.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of persons naturally goes hand in hand with the creation of an area of security and justice which also enjoys enhanced police and judicial cooperation and respect for transparency and legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore falls to the various institutions to act promptly, each in the area of its responsibilities, in order to meet people"s expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that it would be beneficial for everyone if the Council and the Commission were more open in their cooperation with the European Parliament, in these areas, as in many others.

We have succeeded in some areas such as antibiotic resistance – that has been banned – and also on GMOs that cross‐breed. That too has been banned. Other categories may be added later.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a huge amount of confusion over the time limit of 12 years. Initially we wanted what the Commission proposed, namely seven years. We then had to propose 12 years because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which is supposed to protect public health and the environment, actually weakened the proposal and took out the time limit. So it was essential that we put some amendment in. We put in 12 years because we felt we would get some sort of consensus for it, which we did. But it is still unacceptable that the Environment Committee should actually water down a proposal by the Commission. We are supposed to be there to protect public health. That is a total contradiction.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole issue of fast‐track marketing is extremely concerning for the Greens. Basically it will mean that Member States who have some sort of conscience about environmental protection and public health will be side‐lined because the Commission will decide and negotiate with the United States. Member States who feel it is important to protect the environment and public health will be side‐lined. Already there are Member States within the European Union who have a conscience about this issue, who have serious reservations. The European Union is now going to set aside their concerns and negotiate as a whole. So multinational companies who control the EU and the United States are going to control this whole issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are two of the reasons why we voted against this report. Having said that, there are some very positive elements in it. But even on time limits it is quite confusing. In certain areas we voted for the 12 year time limit but later on there were other votes taken which seemed to confuse the whole issue. So it is not very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most disappointing things is the fact that the Environment Committee and the Socialist Group, along with the PPE in this House, have collaborated with industries' interests instead of with the interests of public health and consumer protection and the environment. History will prove that they were irresponsible in not upholding the rights of the environment and of public health.</p>

It represents the demolition of environmental and safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have even backtracked from the Commission's stance. The fact that we want to limit the marketing of products to a fixed period where there is inadequate monitoring experience relating to the marketing of comparable organisms effectively means that human beings and their environment are being used as guinea pigs, because if there is not enough experience available, these products should not be put on the market at all. And we have no right to say that they can be marketed for a fixed period. This is tantamount to saying that we shall see what has happened after twelve years, and only then will we draw the necessary conclusions. That, I believe, is utterly irresponsible, just like the simplified procedure, the procedure for simultaneous release in several Member States and the Category I classification, because all these organisms fall under Category I. This means in effect that an environmental risk assessment is virtually ruled out.</p>
<p class="contents">I find this more than deplorable, along with the fact that no scope has been created for more stringent labelling. This makes it obvious that we have bowed the knee to industrial interests here. We shall see what the Council makes of it, and whether we can still pull the fat out of the fire together and initiate something that will really take us forward.

<p class="contents">I am calling on the Irish representatives to come off the fence and, along with other Members of the Parliament, to resist the intimidating lobbying tactics of the gene‐industry. These companies are panicking because their plan to foist their tampered food products on the public in secret has been exposed.

Ethical considerations underlie many of the questions surrounding genetic engineering technology. Research has run on ahead, with public debate and political regulation lagging well behind. Ordinary citizens lack the knowledge to oversee developments, and this limits all our scope for reflection and critical appraisal. This directive is designed to introduce strict rules to govern the deliberate release of GMOs. The safety of human beings and the environment is put first, which is a good thing. And many of the amendments tighten up the Commission"s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we feel that a more restrictive stance on the development of GMOs for use in food production should have been adopted from the outset. Equally, there should have been broader discussion of the advantages of this kind of research before we accepted trial applications, followed by the presence of GMOs in our food.</p>

And yet, in spite of this somewhat dramatic title, the actual context of the text turns out to be quite vague, to the extent that 177 Members – including those from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations – out of 439 saw fit to oppose it.</p>
<p class="contents">The content of this text is admittedly not completely negative. For example, the European Parliament has just voted in favour of some interesting amendments that recognise civil liability and force people to take out sufficient liability insurance to cover the losses that might be incurred by persons releasing GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this positive point, there are four major faults with the report which have led us to reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it confirms that a centralised procedure in Brussels for the release of GMOs is planned for the majority of cases without any safeguard for Member States who would like to adopt more stringent measures. Therefore, under the auspices of the single market, it appears that underhand plans are afoot which might soon force Member States who do not want anything to do with GMOs to soften their approach towards them against their wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it creates a simplified consent procedure for GMOs which contains a number of references. Speeding up the procedure of common law like this would mean that cases would not be properly researched, and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the European Parliament has extended the time‐limit for placing GMOs on the market to 12 years, whereas the Commission itself only proposed a seven‐year time‐limit. This undoubtedly signifies a victory for pressure groups who have been lobbying the larger parties in this House, both the Socialists and the Christian Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, some high risk GMOs have not been banned with sufficient force. Like the Green Group, we would like to see three categories of GMOs prevented from being placed on the market: GMOs with antibiotic resistant genes; GMOs with toxins that are dangerous for useful fauna; and GMOs likely to crossbreed with similar wild or cultivated species. Instead of voting for an outright ban, Parliament has voted in favour of some very weak amendments, while claiming that certain measures need to be taken to prevent the transfer of genes from these GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, this proposal for a directive provides a general view of the direction in which European integration is currently heading: it is taking power away from the Member States and centralising it in Brussels under the pretext of being able to defend the people better. However, once the people have been stripped of their powers, the central decision‐makers, who are in the driving seat, are themselves not monitored by anyone and do what they like. In the end, we find ourselves in a no‐win situation, at the mercy of forces that are based in Brussels far more than anywhere else.</p>

Neither politicians nor scientists can foresee the consequences for man and nature. It is therefore unforgivable, as things stand, to be giving the green light to genetically modified products; future generations may well have to pay dearly for our mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee has produced a good piece of work, endeavouring to make the best of the situation. Many of the amendments were tabled in a similar spirit. Sadly, Parliament did not vote in favour of some of the most important ones, however, including the right of Member States to say ‘no" (a ‘black list") and more stringent labelling requirements. Along with the rest of the Green Group, I therefore voted against the report.</p>

This is why it is important that European firms and research institutes should be able to operate in the same way as their partners in America and Japan. Only then will they be able to survive against cut‐throat competition worldwide. The industry needs a clear and viable legislative framework, and it goes without saying that great care is needed in this new field. Many of today"s amendments to the Commission proposal for the release of genetically engineered organisms in the environment would result in excessively restrictive legislation for the biotechnology sector, putting the food industry and the EU"s competitive position at a disadvantage compared with the US. The legislation would also have an impact in the Netherlands, where biotechnology has become one of the country"s leading sectors, and this is why the VVD delegation has departed from the ELDR Group"s position by voting against a number of amendments, including those tabled by Mrs Dybkjaer and Mr Eisma. The VVD continues to demand an unambiguous, viable and straightforward European legislative framework with simplified procedures for the biotechnology sector.</p>

<p class="contents">With this in mind, strict labelling procedures must be introduced to enable genetically engineered products to be monitored effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">During the various debates we have had on genetically modified organisms, industrialists have persistently stated that the release of such organisms is under control. This is why our group supported the urgent request calling on the Commission to introduce specific rules relating to the liability of the various operators.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis has highlighted the dangers of focusing all research on extremely high levels of agricultural production and the need to provide for a genuinely independent monitoring system. To this end, we supported the plan to create a central scientific committee, but we must ensure that the proper procedures are developed so that the mistakes that were made during the mad cow crisis are not repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, our group places much emphasis on the need to retain the precautionary principle so as to guarantee both consumer and environmental protection. The citizens of Europe will only fully accept biotechnology if they receive genuine assurances about its safety.</p>

However, here we are faced with the prospect of GMOs being released into the environment after only three years of piecemeal experiments and with no extra time allotted for assessing their direct or indirect effects on the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we must bear in mind the answer given by the Commissioner for Industrial Affairs when asked if he thought that industrialists and politicians were not playing the sorcerer"s apprentice once again. Mr Bangemann replied, ‘ We must not create metaphysical problems with GMOs; placing them on the market will prove their worth".</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, in the Commission"s view, the best guinea pigs are still the consumers, to the extent that they are not even granted the right to correct information on the goods they are buying as labelling procedures are so lax. They are not even granted the freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report mentions on page 33 that genetically modified crops present ‘few risks", but what does this decidedly unscientific term actually mean? We should remember that the nuclear power station at Chernobyl was, until April 1986, said to have presented ‘few risks".</p>
<p class="contents">According to Professor Cabrol, we should not ban GMO production in Europe and thus let the Americans have a monopoly on GMO products. This is an interesting comment, but his conclusions are surprising since if the Americans are allowed to export products that have not been fully tested to Europe, the best response is not for us to produce similar products ourselves. The only acceptable answer for the sake of public health is to ban the import of such products altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the logical application of a simple, but fundamental, principle, namely, the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we explain the European Commission"s submission in the face of American agri‐industrial lobbies? GMOs, sterile hybrid seeds, the patenting of life forms, and so on, are all perhaps part of a more global strategy concerning people"s and nations" dependency on food. As one American secretary of state said, food is the best weapon of the future.</p>

All genetically modified foods must be clearly labelled to allow consumers make an informed choice when feeding their families and loved ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent advances in bio‐technology were first brought home to us by British scientists when they produced Dolly the Sheep – the world's first genetically‐cloned sheep. And, with proper safeguards, biotechnology has the potential to help mankind defeat world hunger and disease. Without proper safeguards, however, the consequences of altering the order of nature are unthinkable. Safety must always come first.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Government has proven its commitment to the welfare of consumers by creating the FSA (Food Standards Agency). Its Tory predecessors, in contrast, were committed only to the welfare of the food industry and created BSE. Only Labour will stand up for ordinary people against Monsanto's madness and ensure that the food on our plates is safe to eat.</p>
