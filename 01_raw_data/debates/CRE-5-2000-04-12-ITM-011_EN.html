<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the report which I have the honour to present is the result of an extraordinary collaboration – which I am grateful for – between people and committees. Allow me to make two observations: the Committee on Legal Affairs has not accepted all the suggestions of the committee asked for an opinion. We were in complete agreement with most of them and they seemed to us to be very interesting, but we consider that this resolution was not the right place for them and that, by incorporating them, its message would be less clearly expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">That has been my criterion for recommending a vote in favour of the amendments presented in this House. I therefore insist – and the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries is a good example of this – that they have not been included in the resolution, not because I reject their content, but because the message in relation to the internal market strategy had to be clearly expressed. What was that message? That message stems from the position adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs in our resolution of 4 November 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, Mr President, I will concentrate on three ideas. The first concern of the Committee on Legal Affairs –and I hope this House will ratify it tomorrow – is the concept of the situation of the internal market. What does the internal market mean to European construction? These days we hear the siren song of globalisation and together with that goes the idea that we are international. The internal market appears to have become very small in this new globalised economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. This document on the strategy for the internal market expresses this very clearly. The internal market is Europe’s platform in the world. The internal market embodies the key principles of a globalised economy with advantages for Europe in terms of competition. That is the first message of the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to put the emphasis on the principles of the internal market: the principle of proportionality, the principle of mutual recognition, the principle of control of origin. These must be the great pillars upon which this strategy for the internal market is built. We will not make the headlines with this, but it is important nonetheless. The application and control of Community legislation is also important. The Member States must cooperate in this application. We must oppose procedures which are used too frequently, such as ‘gold plating’. We need to strengthen our infringement procedure, we need to consolidate it, make it more transparent and more accessible. We ask that decisions on the outcome of infringement proceedings be explained and that Parliament be informed of them. We ask that infringement cases be processed more quickly and that they be more effectively presented to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message of this resolution is that we need to make the present, rather disorganised laws, which the citizens see as a burden, into a genuine legislation, a coherent and clear framework of rules and regulations, without any overlapping or contradictions. These contradictions are seen by the citizen and by industry as burdens, as a lack of clarity in the message regarding the direction we are taking.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third message is a change in the business culture in Europe. We need businesspeople who are more willing to take risks. To this end we will have to change certain laws, such as for example the European laws on insolvency in general, on the suspension of payments and bankruptcy. We need to put the emphasis on the creation of a genuine capital risk market. We need to convince young Europeans, as young Americans are already convinced, that the best option is not to join a large company, on a long-term basis, but to create new companies. In all of this, electronic commerce, the Internet and new technologies must offer a good platform.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, to sum up, I hope that tomorrow, on voting for the resolution, Parliament will send a clear message. We are behind the Commission in this initiative and of course we want to participate in the whole process, permanently, cooperating, offering ideas and monitoring the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A proportion of its content affects the competences of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It is these points which I wish to discuss specifically.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to say that, in general, one of the criticisms levelled at previous versions of this documents no longer applies. The European Parliament’s resolution of 4 November 1999 said that the document was rather unspecific, that it did not contain specific actions. This new version does contain specific measures and proposals. Let us then analyse the content of these proposals, albeit in general terms.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to taxation, the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is that the Communication is not ambitious enough, especially when compared to previous documents. We are aware of the stumbling blocks encountered in relation to the tax package and that some of its chapters have been blocked, but in situations such as this large doses of political courage are necessary to push proposals forward. We notice a lack of such political courage in this document since the chapter on tax simply reproduces previous Commission commitments, and even leaves aside some of the European Parliament’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to the rules on competition, the Communication opts for deepening the process of reform underway, and this deserves our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the chapter on financial services, it should be highlighted that up to now important progress has been made but, as indicated in the recent single market scoreboard, there is still a lot to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are starting with a European social model – which is a national model – and we are transforming the economic structure of that society. In doing so, we are concerned that the effort to liberalise should not transform the essence of the current European social model. An example of this can be found in an area as apparently banal as urban transport. If urban transport is not subjected to political considerations and the intervention of local authorities, for example, straightforward liberalisation could make it practically impossible for us to reach our workplaces. We have had examples such as the case of Venezuela where a strictly private system of public transport led to a profound social and political crisis in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation presents other difficulties. For example, when public services and public companies are privatised and those public companies come to be controlled by a private sector which in reality replaces the state monopoly with a private monopoly, liberalisation may not come about effectively at all. Liberalisation by means of privatising public companies may end up consolidating dominant positions and private monopolies which in my opinion may offer fewer benefits than a monopoly conceived in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect – which we referred to in the recent debate on the Kuckelkorn report – is the need to coordinate social protection. Social protection in a single internal market cannot simply be left to subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, cohesion also seems to me to be important. If there is no economic and social cohesion, if we do not balance the quality of life in the different regions of the Community, we may find ourselves in a situation where the European Union is an unfair European Union in which some regions will make more progress and others will be left behind. This is the basis of the amendments which Mrs Berger and I are presenting, representing the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I say this especially, Commissioner, so that you can communicate to the Commission, and particularly to Mr Fischler, the fact that the common fisheries policy is one of the few areas of Community activity where until now very few steps have been taken in the creation of a genuine internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy. The current Council Regulation No 3760/92 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, provides for derogations in respect of the internal market, notably in Articles 6 and 7, which allow derogations from the principle of freedom of access to fishing grounds, so that Member States have the right of exclusive exploitation of their fisheries resources within a 12-mile coastal band, as well as a series of preferential fishing rights, through application of the ‘relative stability’ principle, which distributes national fishing quotas. At the same time it lays down restrictions on exercising fishing activities in certain areas known as ‘boxes’. These restrictions on the principle of freedom of action, which were originally intended to be temporary restrictions, have been extended and will be in force until 1 January 2003 as a mechanism to allow certain Member States’ fishing industries to adapt to the rules of free competition in an increasingly open and globalised market. Over 20 years have passed and, as we are about to embark upon a general review of all aspects of the common fisheries policy which, for compelling legal reasons, must take place in 2002, it is now time, I believe, to examine whether the transitional period for adaptation to free competition provided for in the said regulation should be ended.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the fishing industry and the common fisheries policy should also be subject to derogations in respect of the internal market. Therefore, the principles and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties should also be applied to fisheries, in other words, the framework of the common fisheries policy should be brought into line with the general legal framework of Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As she said in her introduction, she has made the very wise decision to focus on what are the most critical issues for the creation of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes. The first one is the need to address, within the Union, the impact of legislation on business. It is particularly important that we ask the Commission to reinforce its activities, to ensure proper compliance cost assessment and to assess the costs on businesses of the new legislation. I say to the Commissioner that we do not expect this to be done as an after-thought, after all the departments in the Commission have developed legislation. It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process. He must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon. Our committee and, indeed, our Group has been emphasising, since this new Parliament started last year, the need to encourage the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union. Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s report emphasises a number of key points such as the need to make business formation cheaper and quicker and the need to remove some of the barriers preventing entrepreneurs from benefiting from the risks of putting capital into starting up new businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disappointed to see that our Socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution. I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow. I invite colleagues to reject that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market. I give credit to all our colleagues, across all political groups, for the speed with which we have dealt with the electronic commerce directive this week. I hope that is appreciated. I hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed. I hope that, together, we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This ongoing discussion process is now encapsulated in the report by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, and I would like to thank her very much for this work, particularly as I am aware that it is often a thankless and less than exciting task to have to work on existing projects. One tends only to make the headlines when one brings new ventures in to the world.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not discard the internal market as if it were an old hat. The introduction of the euro has already brought all the shortcomings of the internal market into sharper relief and it will accentuate them even more clearly in the future. Any failing on the part of the internal market weakens Europe economically and in terms of its credibility vis-à-vis the citizens. If it helps to give the internal market project renewed impetus then we should in fact welcome the new packaging that the Commission has come up with, even if it appears slightly over-contrived and complicated for my taste on many issues.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is important to get the proposed measures underway quickly. In common with Mr Harbour, I believe that in adopting the common position Parliament has made an important contribution to electronic commerce. </p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has been dilatory in many areas. I am thinking mainly of such fundamental draft directives as those pertaining to “copyright in the information society”, “distance selling”, and “financial services”, where we have already been kept waiting for the common position for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If we want to bring the internal market closer to the citizens and make it relevant to their lives, then we should also give the same amount of attention to all issues connected with it. We will only strengthen the internal market and enable it to function at long last if issues such as consumer protection, employment policy, social security, taxation policy, environmental protection and regional policy are included in the debate from the outset, rather than being regarded as incompatible. To this end, we have taken the liberty of tabling a number of amendments supplementary to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s report.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a request to make of Commissioner Bolkestein. We gathered from the Commission’s statement on the Echelon case that, in at least one Member State of our Union (I suspect it is not the only one and that this applies to several) secret services undertake activities with the aim, as permitted under national law, of protecting the economic well-being of a nation, a Member State that is. I believe it would be worth looking at these legal provisions in the light of the fact that we have an internal market and a common European economy, i.e. a common European economic area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concisely outlines and highlights the key points from the Commission’s communication on the strategy to be followed for Europe’s internal market. I would like to highlight some of these points. </p>
<p class="contents">The promised dialogue between the Commission on the one hand and business and citizens on the other is to be welcomed because the relationship between the Commission, the European Parliament and society should, after all, be interactive. In order to keep pace with the present breakneck speed at which technology is developing, it is not only desirable but essential to keep the dialogue going. So far, the average citizen has had insufficient insight into what drives the Union and what can be gained from European cooperation. This is why information campaigns are essential. After all, Europe cannot afford to remain a remote spectacle. Back to basics should be our motto. </p>
<p class="contents">The e-Europe<span class="italic"> </span>initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia. This is very commendable indeed but, rather than just creating a frame, it is more important to give substance to education. I would like to repeat the words of the French President spoken at the official opening of this Parliament building and I quote: “We must create a citizens’ Europe in which each individual gradually comes to see that he or she has a role to play. We have a duty to build this great common house in which each individual nevertheless feels at home. A house in which everyone lives together, in a spirit of solidarity, but in which each individual retains his or her identity”.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to meet these objectives, the residents need to get to know and get a feel for their house, or rather their home. In order to build a genuine internal market, we should, more than anything, concentrate on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized businesses. To this day, there are still too many obstacles. Companies’ competitiveness and dynamism depend directly on a regulating climate which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can only echo the need for SLIM. Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language. Superfluous legislation should be withdrawn. It would therefore be beneficial to draw up a scoreboard of laws which have been abolished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the debate, Mr Harbour referred to an amendment tabled on behalf of Mrs Berger and myself – Amendment No 2, paragraph 22(2). If I am not mistaken, Mr Harbour said that he was opposed to our amendment. I believe that there has been a little confusion. In the Spanish version which I have there is no problem. The amendment is based on the German text, which causes some concern because it refers to the issue of share options. I imagine that in the English text which Mr Harbour has there is no problem either. The Spanish text simply says “remove the barriers imposed on entrepreneurs capitalising on company value through the issue of share options on the stock exchange”. If this is the correct text, there is really no problem, in which case I would withdraw that amendment and simply ask for the German version to be adapted to what is said in the Spanish text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, many thanks for giving me the floor regarding an issue which is very dear to the Commission as a whole and myself, in particular, namely the new strategy for the internal market. To begin with, I would like to extend my warm thanks to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for the ardent support she has shown for the set of measures proposed by the Commission. The Commission feels confirmed in its intention thanks to this important vote of confidence coming from this Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has mentioned three topics. First of all, she stressed the importance of the internal market as a forum in the world, which is essential for the competitiveness of European industry and the European service industry, and she is absolutely right, of course. This is, in fact, echoed in Mrs Berger’s remarks, who stated that the internal market is not an old hat one can simply take off, the internal market is and will remain essential to European competitiveness as a forum in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s second remark highlights a number of inconsistencies. According to her, sometimes one does not know where one stands. This would be a serious shortcoming if it were true to this extent. Needless to say, the Commission attempts to establish internal consistency between rules, but it is, of course, possible for rules to be in conflict with one another in certain areas. If this were the case, then the Commission would be more than happy to rectify this situation. I would like to thank Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and the other Members for their comments regarding specific inconsistencies between rules. This will enable the Commission to do something about this. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s third remark concerns the change in culture. This is an important yet very difficult topic, which predominantly refers to the availability of risk capital, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has also pointed out. There happen to be bankers in the risk capital industry who believe that Europe has the money but lacks the entrepreneurs. In other words, according to these bankers I spoke to recently, the bottleneck is not so much due to the availability of capital as to the availability of entrepreneurs. This is tied in with the economic culture. </p>
<p class="contents">I happen to disagree with these critics. Responsibility lies with both camps. The bottleneck is the result of both the availability of risk capital, especially the cost of risk capital, but we are also, of course, lacking the sufficient entrepreneurship. This is down to Europe’s economic culture which still instils in us the belief that bankruptcy will stay with a young entrepreneur for a long time, while in the United States, as everyone knows, bankruptcy is taken far more lightly. </p>
<p class="contents">I hence agree with Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi that something needs to be done to breathe new life into Europe’s entrepreneurial culture. Moreover, I suspect that in the light of developments, which are termed the “new economy”, an increasing number of, mainly, young people, young entrepreneurs, will be encouraged to start up a business. </p>
<p class="contents">After having expressed my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, I would now like to move on to remarks made by Mr Berenguer Fuster. According to him, the Commission should have more political courage, especially in the fiscal domain. My response to Mr Berenguer Fuster is: should the Commission have yet more political courage? What the Commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve. That does not just pertain to the topic that was under discussion earlier this evening, namely the coordination of taxes and tax legislation regarding pension contributions. It also concerns the taxation package formulated by my predecessor, Mr Monti. Moreover, during the discussion of the previous topic, Mr Lipietz remarked that he, and probably his group too, is not prepared to further liberalise the provision of financial services if the package, also known as the Monti package, is not adopted. I would like to oppose such reasoning which has no foundations in the real world. It would be an example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, if Parliament or the Commission were to say that they refuse to make further attempts to integrate the financial services if no progress were made in terms of the taxation package. This would not be the right attitude, in my opinion. Although Mr Berenguer Fuster has not said this in so many words of course, I would still like to take the opportunity to stress this point. </p>
<p class="contents">I ask Mr Berenguer Fuster if he would like the Commission to have yet more political courage? We are already struggling to achieve what we have proposed. I would like to see the Commission achieve what it has proposed to do first and then take it from there. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berenguer Fuster has also said that a great deal still needs to be done in the field of financial services. And he is right, of course. Mr Berenguer Fuster is undoubtedly familiar with the action plan for financial services which was adopted on 13 May 1999 and which includes 43 objectives. We are in the process of achieving these, at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year. I am hoping, on behalf of the Commission, to make certain proposals regarding pensions, for example – we discussed this topic a moment ago – but also regarding the opening up of markets for postal services, regarding the public provision of goods and services, public tendering etc., before the summer recess. We are truly active in the field which is dear to Mr Berenguer Fuster.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to comment on a remark made by Mr Medina Ortega. He said that at present, there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies. I would like to assure Mr Medina Ortega that this is, of course, by no means the intention. Replacing a state monopoly by a private monopoly only makes matters worse. This is certainly not the intention of this Commission. What the Commission does intend to do, however, is to add substance to the decisions taken by the European Council at Lisbon, namely to free up the markets for gas, electricity, transport and postal services a lot faster. The Commission is trying to flesh this out and this also means that those state monopolies need to allow for more competition in the fields I mentioned a moment ago. But, I repeat, the prospect of replacing state monopolies by private monopolies is something which we do not exactly relish. </p>
<p class="contents">I would then like to come back to the remarks made by Mr Harbour, who, like Mr Beysen and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, was absolutely right to highlight the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and the costs related to running these businesses. The Commission is aware that, for example, the costs involved in establishing a business or a small business over here far outstrip the costs in the United States. To give you an idea of the cost difference, it takes an average of five days to set up a small or medium-sized business in the United States. In Europe it takes far longer, even as long as five months, a ratio of 1 in 30. This is, of course, directly reflected in the cost. If we then talk about culture, and I am addressing Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi once again, we need to try to do something about these establishment costs of small businesses very quickly, because otherwise we will naturally come off second-best in the competitive battle with North America. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to turn to Mrs Berger as I have already responded to Mr Beysen’s remarks concerning small and medium-sized businesses. I have quoted what Mrs Berger said earlier about the hat which you cannot simply take off. I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place. They take it for granted and do not give it any further thought. This could not be further from the truth. The internal market is far from complete. We must – and the Commission does, in fact – work on it week in week out and defend it, because the internal market is subject to constant pressure, and the Member States fall back into old, protectionist habits which we need to fight. Mrs Berger was right to refer to directives which remain in the Council. We are all familiar with examples of directives which remain in a vacuum for five, ten or even fifteen years because they are not adopted by the Council. Let us hope that this will change. If you will allow me to highlight one aspect of it: we all hope, of course, that the difference of opinion which is keeping Spain and the United Kingdom divided over a well-known rock in the Southern half of this continent, will now be resolved. I read in an article in a Spanish newspaper that the issue is moving in the right direction. This would actually unblock half a dozen directives. We are all waiting for this moment. </p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, on the subject of Echelon, I can assure Mrs Berger that this is completely unrelated to the internal market and does not form any threat to it whatsoever. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this concludes my remarks. Could I once again express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament and the rapporteur, in particular, for the important vote of confidence which we received from Parliament regarding the new strategy for the internal market? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
