<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moreira da Silva (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been waiting for ten years, since the Rio de Janeiro Conference, for this moment to arrive. It is true that the absence of the United States makes the Kyoto Protocol less universal than we would have liked. It is also true that the Protocol is less ambitious than originally intended. Nevertheless, the alternative to this small step would be incomparably worse: without the political agreement reached in Marrakech, we would have to waste another ten years in negotiations on drawing up a new Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, pleased that tomorrow we will adopt the Kyoto Protocol and we hope that this can enter into force as early as this year. There is, however, one aspect of the Council decision that concerns me. I am talking about the alleged desire of Denmark to reopen discussions on the burden sharing agreement, which was approved in 1998. Such a renegotiation is unjustifiable, unacceptable and would heap ridicule on the European Union’s international standing. We should remember that, very recently, we censored Russia for attempting to do exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in addition to this environmental message that demands that we act, approving the Kyoto Protocol also sends out other political signals that are worth highlighting. Firstly, it has proved that it is possible to regulate globalisation. Secondly, the European Union has demonstrated its capacity for leadership and, in this particular instance, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on the admirable way in which she has exercised this leadership. Thirdly, it has created a new economic paradigm, the carbon economy. From now on, the price of a tonne of carbon will be quoted on the markets and carbon dioxide emissions will represent a cost to be reflected in the price of all products. The winners will be those able to produce the same things using cleaner technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Having assessed the situation, let us now talk about the future. Between 1990 and 1999 the European Union already achieved a 4% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the lack of commitment by the vast majority of the Member States is still a matter of serious concern and the situation is very worrying in some sectors, such as transport, in which it is predicted that emissions will increase by 50% in the next ten years. Given this framework, the community instruments proposed by the Commission are to be praised, specifically the European Climate Change Programme and the directive on emissions trading, on which the European Parliament is due to deliver an opinion within the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although we know what the Community strategy is, what role should the Member States play? In my view, the Member States must not fall into the easy temptation of only implementing reduction measures that entail low costs in both economic and political terms. This would basically be an attempt to resolve the problem by cutting emissions in industry and in the energy sector without tackling the transport or civil construction industries. This option would be environmentally dishonest and economically irrational. By avoiding applying the policy to some sectors, Member States would not only be wasting an opportunity for technological change but would also run up a much higher reduction bill for the future. The strategy must, therefore, involve a reorientation of economic polices, internalising the environmental costs of the ‘greenhouse effect’ in all economic sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This will only be possible if we introduce certain measures that are considered to be consensual, such as the production of renewable energies, energy efficiency and public transport, in addition to clearly unpopular measures such as ending subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, an energy tax and a tax on carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector. I shall conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups for their cooperation and commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Wallström, who has done everything to make it possible for us to now discuss in definite terms the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which, we can now, thank God, get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow we can say only ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the Kyoto Protocol, but it has taken a great deal of work to give us the chance to say ‘Yes’ to a comprehensive agreement. I thank all those who have played a part in this. The Kyoto Protocol has come in for heavy criticism and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Most recently, as the rapporteur has mentioned, it is burden sharing on which criticism has again been focused. I will say here quite openly that burden sharing merits criticism, and that those who say that the burdens are shared unfairly, are right. No one, though, is reducing too much; all the Member States are reducing too little. The experts tell us quite unambiguously that, if we want to put a stop to climate change, we must reduce greenhouse gases by 50% worldwide. The magnitude of the task and the pettiness of the discussions between the Member States about this first step – which is, after all, a very modest one – is shown if we work on the basis that the industrialised countries need to reduce by over 50% in order for the developing countries to have any kind of chance of achieving some sort of prosperity for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">India produces a tonne of CO2 per head of the population, as against the Member States of the European Union with about 10 tonnes on average. Against such a backdrop it is bad enough that some EU Member States are permitted to increase their emissions, and that the Member States that produce a very great deal of pollution, such as the one from which I come, complain about now having to reduce their emissions by a relatively large amount.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto Protocol is only an initial step and must be followed by many others. We should not, therefore, be small-mindedly discussing the number of places after the decimal point, but energetically striving for a sustainable economy, being careful with resources and saving energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot help but wonder if it is always the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that meets on Tuesday night during the part-session in Strasbourg or whether we are regarded as some kind of suspect fundamentalist sect that is always placed lowest down on the agenda. That would be pretty odd, given that we are responsible for one of the most important issues in Parliament, namely that of the environment. I should like to ask both the President and the Commissioner to look into whether it would be possible to change this, that is to say whether it would be possible at least sometimes to raise the status of environmental issues by debating them in the daytime and not always after nightfall.</p>
<p class="contents">I had really intended to begin by parodying a well-known Conservative politician in Sweden who once said that he was not only a Hallander but also a European. I should like to say, today, that I am not only a proud Gothenburger but also a proud European. I am proud to be able to say that Parliament has now concluded its debate on the Kyoto Protocol, and I look forward to the Council’s also being able to ratify it in March.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly proud, however, of having been able to participate in the little delegation that visited the United States last week. We were given the opportunity of discussing the climate issue with both Congress and the House of Representatives. I have the sense that there is not only a physical ocean separating the continents but also a mental ocean, given the way in which the United States regards the climate issue and believes it should be handled. Certainly, the climate issue has now been recognised as a problem in the United States because their own researchers have stated that it <span class="italic">is</span> a problem. However, it is still believed that the solution to this problem is to be found in the United States. It is this view that most divides us. The United States regards a global environmental threat as a domestic problem that only concerns Americans, while the European attitude is that the issue should be dealt with jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to thank the Commissioner for having taken such an active role and also thank the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who has kept us together and ensured that we have held a common view and position beyond the frontiers of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, in the future, to stick together not only in theory but also in practice. That cohesion will be put to the test following ratification, as it will also be when, a little later on in the spring, we debate the European Climate Change Programme and emissions trading. It is just unfortunate that certain members of the Council will feel the need to make a fuss about the way in which the burden is distributed. It is pretty pathetic that it is Members from a Scandinavian country who will be doing this. However, there are black sheep everywhere. Whatever the case, I am pleased that we are able to conclude the debate on the Kyoto Protocol today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bush senior was in two minds whether he would actually go to Rio, but he eventually went and signed the Rio Agreement. The attempt to conclude an agreement with the Clinton/Gore administration in The Hague at the end of 2000 failed. It was disconcerting to witness how Bush subsequently discarded the Kyoto Agreement. Fortunately, the breakthrough came in Bonn in July of last year – a major breakthrough – and it is for my group of great importance that nuclear energy plays no role, either with the CDM or with the Joint Implementation<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will ratify the Agreement tomorrow. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has already given us a taste of what to expect: 33 votes for, 0 against, 0 abstentions. We will see similar figures tomorrow too. We will be voting unanimously. Hopefully, the Council will do the same, which on 4 March will first need to iron out a minor Danish issue, but I feel confident. Europe has taken the lead, and I, too, should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her boundless commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the content is concerned: 8% less in Europe and 5% less in the industrialised world, is far from good enough. However, Kyoto is the only international Treaty we have for combating global warming. And like the Ozone Treaty, it will need to be improved many times. But Canada, Japan, Australia and Russia still need to ratify the Treaty first. This will hopefully be done before the Rio Plus 10 Summit meeting in Johannesburg. Like Bush senior, Bush junior is in two minds whether he should go to Johannesburg. Hopefully, like his father, he will decide to attend after all. Last week, we were in Washington with a small delegation, and there are indications that the United States is actually under pressure to change its attitude. The Democrats were embarrassed about the fact that their country was not participating in the Kyoto Protocol, and a number of Republicans too have seen the light. Bush will probably proclaim a national climate policy soon: a modest, partial disengagement from economic growth and energy consumption. Not good enough but far better than what he stated a year ago. We have made it clear that the economic costs of such a policy for America will be greater than the costs of taking part in Kyoto. It is also satisfying that a number of large concerns in the US want America to take part in the Kyoto Protocol. The question is no longer whether, but when, the United States will take part.</p>
<p class="contents">Three major questions remain. First of all, there is the implementation. Attaining 8% less is starting to become a serious matter. Then there is the discussion about the objectives following the initial period. One per cent less per annum is a very good start, and I hope that the Commission can confirm this. Finally, the most important and most difficult issue is to persuade the developing countries to come onboard in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that in September we can celebrate the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. We will have to consider whether or not these last ten years have been wasted.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on the one hand we recall how reports, financed mainly by Americans, were falsified during this period to show that climate change did not exist, in the same way that any scientist who insisted on the problems that climate change could cause, was discredited, it is also true to say that public awareness has greatly increased over these ten years. In other words, we may have wasted time in implementing measures, but the level of public awareness is higher than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that today we are all aware of the significance of the Kyoto Protocol, the meaning of climate change and its associated effects, such as the submergence of islands, the destruction of coastline, the massive displacement of millions of people and the loss of biodiversity. Therefore, I think that we have made gains on the one hand even if we have suffered losses on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that, from 1990 to 1999, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced in Europe, but it must be said that this is due, to a large extent, to two countries in particular, for very specific reasons. There are many countries, such as my own, whose greenhouse gas emissions have increased – excessively, to my mind. Spain’s emissions have increased by 23%, although the possibility that at the next Council of Ministers, according to today’s papers, the Spanish government will decide to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is to be welcomed and is good news. This is an example that other countries should follow, to be able to reach, in September, the figure of 55 countries needed to ratify the Protocol, which account for over 55% of all greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, in agreement with some of my fellow Members, that the final result is not as ambitious as expected some years ago, but, as Mr Moreira da Silva also states, the alternative would be much worse. We have to work to ensure that States ratify the Protocol, but also that they implement specific measures, with the priority of those economic sectors that pollute the most, such as transport. The rapporteur very clearly states that emissions caused by transport could rise by 50% over the next decade. Priority measures should be direct action in key economic sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr Moreira da Silva that the balance that has been achieved should be left alone, for, as many of my fellow Members have already said, Mrs Wallström and this Parliament have done some great work and, although it may be modest, the step forward is very significant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU has shown astonishing powers of leadership in talks on climate change. Without that, the Protocol could not have been saved.</p>
<p class="contents">European companies have had to agree to strict measures to try to achieve an 8% reduction by 2012 compared to the 1990 levels. Our competitors in the United States do not have to withstand this burden, President Bush has stated quite coolly that this way he is protecting American industry and production.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU cannot bear the responsibility for the entire world alone. The USA, Russia and China must all commit themselves to a common aim. This has been insisted on strongly at WTO talks. It is not merely a matter of commercial policy but the world we share and our future.</p>
<p class="contents">The burden has already been shared within the EU. Now there is talk of emissions trading. We cannot let emissions be auctioned off; we have only bad experience of the UMTS and other auctions. I am especially worried about those industrial sectors and companies that have already made massive investments to reduce emissions. These responsible companies cannot now be allowed to pick up the bill again. Surely it is nobody’s intention to force successful and environmentally caring companies out of the market?</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s need for energy is only increasing with economic growth, regardless of the savings made. To achieve the Kyoto targets we have to continue to save energy and adopt the use of renewable energy sources. To ensure the supply of basic levels of energy, however, nuclear energy is the only realistic option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that tomorrow's vote will see us achieve the greatest possible majority and perhaps even unanimity on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a cultural significance to this, for – if I am right – Europe would be assuming cultural leadership on an important issue for the first time since the Second World War. In the past, we always followed the Americans, trailing them by five to ten years. This time, Europe is indeed ahead. That is something that I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a few, though, are aware of what this ratification signifies. Signing it takes no time, but putting it into practice is extraordinarily difficult. Some have already referred to that. I find it all the more regrettable that, on this issue, we – we, the popularly and directly elected European Parliament – are only being consulted. This is a great economic upheaval – and we are only being consulted. That strikes me as extraordinarily regrettable, although I must say that I would still say ‘Yes’ to Kyoto if Parliament had the right of codecision, and I assume that my fellow Members would do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">I also call to mind the fact that we are acting on the basis of the precautionary principle, which has, in the meantime, found its way into our lawmaking. Were we not to act, our inaction could, under certain circumstances, lead to us being sued in the European Court of Justice and compelled to ratify Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement also has its advantages, for we are putting our industry and ourselves under pressure to develop the most energy-efficient products and processes, and, finally, we are making ourselves competitive, even though I cannot deny that there will also be difficulties for some branches of industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against certain legal advice, we are now, however, satisfied that our opinion on this matter is being heard, and this is because we have said how important it is to have the Protocol ratified at long last. Parliament is really doing its utmost now to see that the Kyoto Protocol will be in force when the meeting on sustainable development is held in Johannesburg in September. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add my thanks to those expressed here both to the rapporteur and the Commissioner. It is certainly true that this process, which has now ended with the acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol by the Community, will not be the last indication that the European Union can demonstrate a real capacity for global leadership, and can also show its citizens, as the rapporteur stated, that globalisation can also be controlled if proper rules are applied to it.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been talk of the economy in this debate. It is important to realise that a good number of companies have already become aware of just how much potential there is for business in policies on climate. We must also have confidence in this and include the United States in the process. As my colleague, Mr de Roo said in his speech, a large number of companies in the USA wish the United States would become involved in this process. It may actually be, as my country’s Minister of the Environment has said in this connection, that the USA will become the last open-air museum of the old technology unless it joins in these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have before us the task of implementing the Kyoto Agreement in practice in the Community. Thanks go to the Commission for the swiftness with which it proposed a directive on emissions trading as well as a large-scale climate programme just before the Marrakesh Conference. This spring the European Parliament can now participate with determination in drafting the rules of this directive on emissions trading. I believe that in this we will be acting with the express purpose of seeing to it that the companies that have already played their part will also receive a reward of some sort, and that all the other companies will also be tempted to join in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that the Spanish Presidency is determined to overcome any last-minute difficulties that could arise and that the result will be satisfactory. This will mean that the European Union is taking another step forwards in leading the struggle against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen once again this evening that the United States is widely criticised for not sharing the level of commitment the Protocol demands. This puts all EU Member States, and this is particularly true if we are able to get the United States to sit around the negotiating table, in a position of urgent need to fulfil each and every one of the provisions laid down in the Protocol, unless we want to suffer total ridicule and have our reputation in international politics tarnished.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, although achieving the Kyoto objectives will not be easy, it is possible. This is demonstrated by the data in Mr Moreira da Silva’s resolution. We must become a society that is poor in carbon and rich in the use of cleaner technologies, taking full advantage of energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the role of the market is crucial to achieving these objectives, but we are still hesitant when it comes to implementing specific measures, above all when we give in to those short-sighted sentiments that still perceive the Kyoto Protocol as an attack on competition and employment when it should be seen, because it can now be seen, that the opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act on demand at Community level on aspects such as the internalisation of costs, emissions trading and the exchange of certain policies such as transport, energy or agriculture. With regard to demand, we must focus on training and motivating some European consumers who are still very apathetic and uninformed in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the rapporteur has tabled a proposal that is committed to sustainable development, which is clear and precise in stating exactly where we need to act. For this reason it deserves, and I think already has, this Parliament’s gratitude and total support. Thank you, Mr Moreira da Silva. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish first of all to thank Mr Moreira Da Silva for the report and for the fact that it has been possible to resolve this issue of such political importance by means of a vote in Parliament at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to take the opportunity to emphasise how much I value the cooperation with the European Parliament concerning the Kyoto Protocol. Your efforts, including visits to the United States and contacts with parliamentarians in different countries, have been extraordinarily important. The cooperation we have had during the negotiations, especially under Mr Moreira Da Silva’s leadership, has contributed to our having come as far as this on our home ground. I also wish to say that I consider it self-evident and very important that Parliament should be fully involved in the work we are now doing on the European Climate Change Programme and on the proposal concerning emissions trading.</p>
<p class="contents">For some years, the EU has of course advocated that the Kyoto Protocol should come into force at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg in September of this year. If it is to be possible to achieve this objective, the EU should set a good example. Mr Liese and Mr Linkohr are right: even though we can quarrel about the distribution of the burden, this is just a first step if we want to take the climate experts seriously. It can only be seen as a first cautious step along the road.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased about Parliament’s support for the proposal’s being adopted as soon as possible so that we can ratify the whole proposal by no later than 1 June, when the Member States have concluded their own national procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment briefly on what is termed the Danish problem, which is to be regarded as a technical complication. It is also in terms of a technical problem that we are trying to solve the issue. At the Council meeting in December, the Environment Ministers agreed that we should try to find such a technical solution and that a decision should be taken during the Council meeting on 4 March. I hope that this will be possible. If this decision is adopted at the Environment Council meeting in March, this would be a clear signal that the EU is determined to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, a move that would strengthen the EU’s credibility and leadership role in the matter of combating climate change. It would also increase the pressure on other parties, for example Japan and Russia, to follow our example. The prospects for this are fairly good, given the way things look at present, particularly in Japan. At the same time, we are going to continue the dialogue with the United States and try to convince them to resume the Kyoto negotiations or at least adopt similar measures on a national basis to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be credible, we must put our own house in order first. In plain language, this means that our first priority must be ratification and effective implementation of the Protocol on the part of the EU. Thank you for your views and for this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
