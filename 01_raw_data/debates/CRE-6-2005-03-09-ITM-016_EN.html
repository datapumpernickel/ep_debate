Throughout recent years, the Council has been keeping a very close watch on their trial. It has intervened on a number of occasions with the Libyan authorities at the highest level, to ensure, in particular, that they were given a fair and equitable trial, especially in view of the fact that Professors Montanier and Collezzi in their final report on the HIV virus infection in Benghazi hospital had concluded that the five nurses and the doctor were innocent.</p>
<p class="contents">In all its actions, the Council has always worked in close cooperation with the Bulgarian authorities and has had the support of other international partners. Bulgaria has thanked the European Union for what it has done. I met the Bulgarian Foreign Minister yesterday to discuss this matter with him once again. Bulgaria can count upon the Council’s help in the future in seeking a positive outcome to this matter. To this end, the Commission has joined with the Council so that the European Union can act in close coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of the question of responsibility for the contamination in Benghazi hospital, it is clear that the issue has aroused strong feelings, particularly among the victims’ families, but also among the population generally. This is why the Council has expressed its profound sympathy with the people infected with the virus at Benghazi hospital. It has stated its readiness to show its solidarity by a humanitarian gesture on their behalf. An action plan drawn up by the Commission is accordingly being implemented at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council now awaits a gesture from Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 11 October 2004, the Council invited Libya to make a positive response to the European Union’s proposed policy of engagement. In this context, the Council insisted that Libya should meet the European Union’s concerns, particularly on the question of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical personnel. The Council feels that a review of the evidence will lead Libya to conclude that a rapid release of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor would be in the best interests of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency assures the European Parliament that the Council will continue to treat this as a matter of high priority and will do everything in its power, in close coordination with the Bulgarian authorities, but respecting the rights of the authorities concerned, to reach the only positive outcome possible in this matter, namely the release of those sentenced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the very difficult issue of the health professionals detained in Libya, which indeed casts a shadow over international relations with that country. In order to fully address this issue, it is necessary to widen the scope of the discussion to also address the issue of the families in Benghazi affected by the mass HIV infection. The Commission considers these to be two separate dramas, but they have been linked by the verdict pronounced in May 2004 against the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff currently detained in Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall first address the issue of the Benghazi families. They are confronted with this infection which, either directly or indirectly, has affected many people. We have recently been reminded again of this tragedy by the recent deaths of some of the children and adults affected. The EU has a deep understanding of the serious consequences of the kind of large-scale accidental infection that affected Benghazi. Having faced similar tragedies in European countries, we have developed programmes to alleviate the effects of such tragedies and a system to prevent similar outbreaks from reoccurring.</p>
<p class="contents">We can use this extensive experience to help the Libyan authorities deal with this situation and contribute to alleviating the plight of the stricken families in Benghazi. On numerous occasions the Commission and the EU have expressed their utmost compassion and solidarity as regards the situation in Benghazi. On the basis of a technical assessment carried out by the Commission in August 2004 and endorsed by the Council, the EU is now implementing an action plan aimed at addressing some of the issues faced by the Bengahzi families and also at enhancing capacities in the health sector in Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of this action plan is an act of solidarity aimed at expressing EU compassion by addressing specific identified needs in Libya. It is the responsibility of all of us to make sure that the action plan is implemented rapidly, completely and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2004, the Commission organised an international meeting to launch the action plan and it is working closely with the Gaddafi Foundation to implement it. Success will depend on contributions by various public and private donors from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now address the issue of the five Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff detained in Libya since 1999. The EU has repeatedly expressed serious reservations over the basis on which the trial was conducted, the treatment of the defendants, and delays in the process. It therefore came as a great disappointment and a source of concern when last May they were condemned to death on grounds that remain, in the Commission's view, unclear and unsatisfactory. Immediately after the verdict was pronounced, the EU and the Commission emphasised the importance we attach to a satisfactory and just outcome of the trial, and requested a reconsideration. An appeal process will soon be examined by the Libyan Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has remained involved in working with the Libyan authorities to reach a satisfactory outcome to this issue. The EU made two formal approaches, at Prime Ministerial level, on 12 June and 27 June 2004. On 3 October 2004, a Commission official visited the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff to express its support for the detainees and to convey its concerns to the Libyan authorities. On 11 October 2004, the Council again expressed its grave concern over the plight of the medical workers and asked Libya to consider the release of the medical staff on the basis of a re-examination of the existing evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to attach high priority to this dramatic issue and is constantly seeking ways to contribute to a positive outcome. It will remain in contact with the Libyan authorities, the Gaddafi Foundation and the Bulgarian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that all those concerned would like to turn the page on this tragedy as soon as possible. On the basis of the existing evidence, that is what must be done. At the same time, we will continue to focus on ways of alleviating the suffering of the Benghazi families and of helping the Libyan authorities build systems that will prevent a repetition of this contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has decided to embark upon a policy of engagement with Libya and has already given considerable recognition to the significant steps taken by Libya to secure reintegration into the international community. Libya has been invited to move towards formal relations with the EU as a Mediterranean partner and as a close neighbour. In this context, the issue of the medical workers remains a serious problem and one which, as Libya understands very well, needs to be brought to an acceptable end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a double tragedy taking place in Libya at the moment. On the one hand there is the awful plight of hundreds of children in Benghazi infected by the HIV virus. We have the most enormous sympathy for them. I very much welcome the decision of the European Union's General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 October 2004 to provide assistance to the Libyan health services. This includes medical equipment and help in establishing a reliable and safe blood bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The other, quite separate tragedy is that since 1999 – for over five years now – Bulgarian medical workers have been imprisoned by the Libyan authorities on charges allegedly related to the HIV infection. This situation was dramatically worsened on 6 May last year when a Libyan court sentenced the Bulgarian nurses to death by firing squad.</p>
<p class="contents">The most reputable international experts have testified that the problem of HIV infection was due to an in-hospital infection, which began over a year before the Bulgarians were hired by the Benghazi hospital. There are no good grounds for the imprisonment of the Bulgarian nurses. They should be released immediately. This is what the declaration of this Parliament, already signed by over 100 Members, is calling for. We ask the highest Libyan authorities to intervene in this matter, above all on grounds of natural justice and humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a very practical reason why this should happen. Over the past year, important steps have been taken to improve the relationship between the European Union and Libya. This has come about because of a number of very sensible decisions taken by the Libyan authorities to dismantle the Libyan WMD programme and to compensate victims of terrorist attacks in which Libya had been implicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall objective of EU engagement is Libya's full integration in the Barcelona process and subsequent progress towards an association agreement. This will not happen without further action on the part of Libya to meet our concerns. The most immediate of these concerns is the plight of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical workers. We ask President Gaddafi to release them now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome the action programme that the Commissioner has outlined today. We should do everything possible to assist the Libyan people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the treatment by the Libyan authorities of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian medical worker makes it very hard to take seriously Libya’s proclaimed desire to rehabilitate itself within the international community. We should remind ourselves that those people were in Libya to assist the Libyans; to provide better healthcare for Libyans. They have become scapegoats for the inadequacies of the Libyan health service.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the infection at the hospital, as indicated by Mr Van Orden, already existed. It was spread because of poor hygiene and because of the re-use of needles. A number of experts has testified that the nature of that contamination makes it almost inconceivable that it was spread deliberately. Rather than simply facing up to the facts, the Libyans have turned tragedy into a further tragedy and into a farce.</p>
<p class="contents">First, they tried to blame the CIA and the Israeli intelligence services, saying it was a conspiracy to undermine Libya. Now, they have blamed the innocent Bulgarian nurses, at least some of whom were tortured before being tried; the trial was clearly unfair and not properly conducted. I very much support what the Council has said and would ask it to continue to pressurise the Libyan Government to come to its senses, to release these people and to become a normal part of the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is truly a nightmare. For six long years, these people – who have devoted their lives to saving lives and caring for their fellow human beings – have languished in prison in Libya in loathsome conditions. The situation is Kafkaesque. The charges against them are unfounded, as researchers have shown.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 March, a court is finally to make a pronouncement on the death sentences against these six people, and this date is therefore incredibly critical. The EU must do everything in its power to secure the immediate release of those concerned. In just a few years’ time, Bulgaria will be a member of the EU. We therefore have a responsibility to these citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In our work on a gradual rapprochement between the EU and Libya within the context of the Barcelona Process, this case is a critical test of the direction that relations between us may take. If the death sentences are carried out, I believe that any future cooperation will be made impossible. At the same time, it is, of course, a terrible tragedy for the children who have been infected with AIDS and their families. The EU can do more. I am very pleased that the Commissioner supports the action plan and sees opportunities for the EU to support Libya in this way so that better care might be obtained in future for those infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is an incredibly important issue. We expect the Council and the Commission to give it priority and to follow events extremely carefully in the period up to 29 March when the court once again pronounces on the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before anything else I would like to express our concerns in connection with the situation of the Bulgarian and Palestinian health workers. Six years ago they came under suspicion, were arrested, and were condemned to death. We were not the first to become involved in the affair, since successive presidencies of the Commission and the Council have dealt with the matter in their sittings. But again we must emphasise that the death penalty falls outside the values and fundamental principles of the European Union, and carrying out these death penalties would nullify the normalisation of relations between the European Union and Libya. We hope that Libya reacts positively to the EU’s efforts and labours to advance long-term, close cooperation. In light of this we hope there will be swift progress in this affair, and nothing other than a fair appeal hearing. Delaying justice is nothing other than a repudiation of justice. Because of this we call on Libya to respond to our concerns at the earliest possible date, and we ask the Council that they initiate a re-examination of the affair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a lack of local medical staff, medical expertise and training, as well as of proper medical facilities and equipment. The problem is more prominent in large, overcrowded city hospitals serving largely poor, underdeveloped urban areas, like the Al Fatah Hospital in Benghazi.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in that hospital, back in 1998, that an outbreak of HIV infection was discovered, affecting approximately 400 children. That outbreak was no surprise to western experts as they knew that the hygiene conditions in that hospital were abysmal and that it was only a matter of time before such a major infection catastrophe occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Libyan Government needed a scapegoat, which was found in the form of five nurses from Bulgaria and one doctor from Palestine. In countries like Libya, getting signed confessions under torture and setting up staged trials is no difficult task. While the international community stood back and watched, these six medical workers, who went to Libya in order to offer their services for the benefit of the Libyan people, were sentenced to death in 2004. They were found guilty of the ludicrous charge of deliberately infecting the children in the Benghazi hospital with HIV. It was alleged by Colonel Gaddafi himself that they did this as part of a CIA and Mossad plot to destabilise the country.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the situation now be remedied? First of all, the EU must take concrete action. I propose the following three steps. Firstly, the President of the European Parliament should request the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to send a small delegation immediately to visit the imprisoned medical workers in Libya and to see Colonel Gaddafi and convey to him the strong wish of Parliament that these medical workers are pardoned and released immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, should immediately send a team of medical experts to Libya to assess the situation in relation to the HIV epidemic in the country and offer expert advice and help to deal with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the EU should take further drastic initiatives in order quickly to lead Libya out of the isolation imposed by the western world from 1992 to 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Such actions, if effective, would be of mutual benefit to the EU in terms of trade enhancement, and to the people of Libya in terms of improving their standard of living. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kindly allow me to say such things as a person living in a country – I live in Malta – which is Libya’s neighbour, just forty-five minutes away from their coast.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, as a person who visits Libya frequently – and who knows the Libyan mentality, as it is in these countries – the point, the key to the solution, is direct contact with the people, direct contact especially with the relatives of the victims. These people are experiencing a major tragedy. I pronounce it as a clear statement – I am against any death penalty, be it in Libya, in the United States or in any other country of the world. However, the key to everything is found in the victims’ relatives and the work that needs to be done in general, in my opinion, with regards to the Libyan health system, but in a particular manner, also socially and psychologically with these families.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to remember that AIDS victims in certain countries – even, I believe, in Europe, but particularly in certain other countries – are highly stigmatised. That means these people have already experienced the death of a relative, in many cases their son or daughter, they have experienced a big shock, and believe, and I say unfairly, that it is these five persons that killed their children and are experiencing this stigma.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, where a Court confirms these people’s guilt but changes their sentence, I believe that there has to be consideration of the idea, by both the Council as well as the Commission, of prisoner exchange, as long as the prisoners within the Member States of the European Union are willing, are ready, to serve their prison sentence in Libya. I think that this is part of the solution for the things that could happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree fully with Mr Muscat. We are indeed dealing with a genuine tragedy. The problem of the infection of children with the AIDS virus, particularly in a country like Libya where AIDS is even more of a taboo subject than in most of our own countries, affects both individual families and the entire population. I believe we also need to make efforts in this area. We have to offer our help to Libya – this is now being prepared and implemented – in its fight against AIDS, and in order to improve its healthcare system so that it can, at least, cope with this tragedy which is affecting the people concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond that, we also need to send a very strong and clear signal to Libya and bring a degree of pressure to bear for justice to be done and for the health workers concerned to be released. Libya wishes to develop and strengthen its relations with the European Union. It cannot do so as long as it continues to persist in its determination to do nothing for these five or six people unjustly condemned to death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has very clearly held out the prospect of a Mediterranean partnership to Libya. We have put forward a number of objectives, some of which have already been achieved, such as the ending of the embargo, while others are still to happen, such as full adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria is about to sign the treaty of accession to the EU, and Libya is well aware that the case of the six Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is politically highly sensitive in Europe. The Libyan authorities also know that the decision on whether it can join the Barcelona process will be made by unanimous vote at the forthcoming European Council, at which Bulgaria and Romania have the right to take part and to speak, even if they cannot vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will continue to maintain direct contacts with Libya, including visits to the Benghazi families. I share the view of a number of Members that we must show our solidarity with the civilian population in Libya that has been hit by the AIDS infection. Our visits to the detained health workers will, of course, continue, and in this respect I hope that the Libyan Government will continue to authorise the prison visits without attaching any conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I can assure you that the Commission’s action plan will continue. We shall keep up our positive efforts with regard to Libya, which we consider an essential partner in the Mediterranean, and we shall work to improve the state of public services for the citizens – of which health is just one example – as a practical demonstration of how relations with Europe can be of real added value to Libya.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
