This will certainly not be the last time, either. There is a very great deal of solidarity with the Tibetan people here in the European Parliament. The Tibetan people have for many years been exposed to appalling treatment by Beijing, and this is continuing. Perhaps there is, however, a very small light at the end of the tunnel inasmuch as a cautious dialogue has been instituted between Beijing and representatives of the Dalaï Lama. The fact that two people like Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo – two very well-known prisoners of conscience to whom attention has been drawn on several occasions in this Chamber – have now been released from their long-term imprisonment is also very positive. There are, however, many more prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this development indicates any fundamental policy change on the part of China. I only wish that it did. I do not, however, believe that that is the case. It is, at any rate, a step on the way. It is all the more worrying, therefore, that the two Buddhist Tibetans, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup have now been sentenced to death. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and have now been branded as terrorists. They have not been given anything in the way of a fair trial; no evidence has been presented; they have been kept in total isolation for eight months; and now they are to be executed. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party demands a fair legal process in accordance with the rule of law and treatment in accordance with international conventions. As always, we condemn the death penalty wherever it is practised. China’s contribution to the international fight against terrorism appears so far, unfortunately, to have been confined to Beijing’s branding opposition dissidents and various minorities as terrorists and in that way obtaining an excuse for oppressing them. That is not how matters should proceed. The fight against terrorism must always be combined with the rule of law. We shall continue to fight for the rights of Tibet, continue to condemn all human rights violations in China and hope that the Commission will step up the human rights dialogue with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a so-called autonomous region in China, however meaningless this autonomy is in practice. Every attempt to achieve real autonomy is, after all, regarded as a crime, giving rise to legal proceedings, and the concept of political offences is unknown in China. Political opponents are simply treated as common criminals. The struggle against terrorism provides yet another excuse for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The death sentences against Tenzin Delek, an influential Buddhist lama, and his assistant, Lobsang Dhondup, pronounced on 3 December, are a sad illustration of this. We regard the accusations as unproven, but the way in which the two people were held in solitary confinement and ultimately sentenced to death after months of incarceration and after a mockery of a trial, confounds us. These death sentences must not be allowed to be carried out; the verdicts must be reviewed on the basis of a fair trial. The dialogue between China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama, who inspires so much hope in this hemisphere, must be resumed, but we must not be naïve in our relationships with this big country. They pay a great deal of attention to what we think of them, but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by diversionary tactics. We must see what is actually happening and bring about change judicially and in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had gained the impression that a real opening up, a genuine dialogue on human rights was actually going to take place. So I too very much welcomed the release of both Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo. We regarded that as a sign that pledges were being honoured and promises were being kept.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcomed the fact that Li Peng honoured his commitment finally to enter into contact with the Dalai Lama and that initial discussions were actually being held with representatives of the Dalai Lama. We regarded these as two very positive signs.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are all the more dismayed now that at exactly the same time two people, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup – a lama and one of his followers – were arrested and kept in solitary confinement for six or even eight months, although to this day it has not been established beyond doubt that they really committed the act of which they were accused. This is totally contrary to the constitutionality that we naturally expect and demand from a people or from a government.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand very well that the fight against terrorism is important, but that means combating genuine terrorism, not dissidents. The fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria, otherwise it cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I only hope that this was a blunder that will be very quickly rectified by the Chinese Government, and that these two people will be released or will at least receive a fair trial. I also hope that China will make sure that the door to human rights, which has been very slightly opened, will not be slammed shut again but will be opened further, so that genuine constitutionality may also prevail in China.</p>

In September an official delegation from the Dalai Lama visited China's leaders. In October, the nun Ngawang Sangdrol was released after decades of imprisonment, following massive international protests, including those from the European Parliament itself. A considerable number of Members of this House had repeatedly nominated her for the Sakharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">Did these welcome steps on the part of the Chinese amount merely to political manoeuvring in the run-up to their President's visit to the USA? Will the path to constructive dialogue now peter out again in the aftermath of the Communist party conference and the far-reaching changes in personnel brought about by it? Are the hardliners getting the upper hand?</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard some alarming reports recently. At the beginning of December, as other Members have mentioned, two Tibetans were sentenced to death by the Kardze People's Court after a trial so rushed that doubt must be cast on its legality. They were accused of owning illegal weapons, of separatism and of taking part in an attack using explosives carried out in Chengdu in April.</p>
<p class="contents">One of those involved is the Tibetan Tulku Tenzin Delek, who has a death sentence hanging over him with a two-year reprieve. He has been committed to preserving Tibetan culture, language and religion for decades. He founded new monasteries and championed the social well-being of the public. His colleague Lobsang Dhondup also faces a death penalty, without reprieve.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that neither of the two defendants received a fair trial. International standards were breached. For example, Tenzin Delek spent eight months in solitary confinement without any contact with his family or with lawyers, which is clearly in violation of the UN's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners. The authorities demanded the payment of bail equivalent to EUR 120 000 before a proper trial could be initiated. His students were arrested when they tried to raise the money.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a flagrant violation of international human rights. It is imperative for the Chinese authorities to maintain legal standards. However necessary the war on terrorism may be, and however much we may all support it, it cannot be waged without respect for the law and for human rights. It is totally unacceptable for the peaceful struggle to practice Tibetan religion and culture to be treated as an act of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I call on the Commission immediately to raise these unfair verdicts under the dialogue on human rights with the Chinese. We must prevent unlawful sentences from being executed and the grant of financial aid must be made dependent on improvements in the area of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to stir your Member States' embassies in Beijing into action without delay, so that these defendants can be given a fair trial. The first step must be to lift the death sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as Chairman of Parliament's Tibet Intergroup, I would like to express my hope that the forces of reason will prevail in China and that our worldwide campaign for human rights and the rule of law will succeed.</p>

<p class="contents">If you only fight terrorism – and that is unfortunately a danger that also exists in Washington – strictly by means of a coalition of the major powers, there is a risk that those powers will misuse that war on terror for their own ends: Moscow will use it against the Chechens and Beijing will use it against Tibet. We need to be fully aware that the sort of repression that has been practised in Tibet or in Chechnya is no way to fight terrorism, it will simply engender it.</p>
<p class="contents">We were talking earlier on about mountain regions. A few decades back there were even bomb attacks here in the Community, in the South Tyrol, which is nowadays a peaceful model region of Europe of which we can be proud. There were even extremist movements in our European democracies. That sounds unlikely today, because by granting autonomy we have ensured that no one takes separatist or terrorist action. We now feel comfortable in the greater community of Europeans and regard ourselves as being at the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to the Chinese is therefore this: ‘Give the Tibetans autonomy, give them democracy, and give them human rights!’ That is the way to fight terrorism and separatism. That is a successful approach that will not lead to terrorism but will genuinely bring peace and ensure that peace will prevail in the world's most important and most historically precious mountain region, peace that can be a model for the entire world.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution before us has much to recommend it, but the wording is rather infelicitous, by which I mean the phrase ‘the Tibetan minority in China’. Of course, in comparison with China's massive population, we are all minorities. However, what we are talking about here is the great Tibetan people with its ancient world culture, which is a valuable heritage for mankind. We appeal to the Chinese to respect this people and its culture as full partners, just as we treat the Tibetans and Chinese as equals.</p>

Also, Mrs Maes, the problem raised today by these two death sentences reveals changes in the borders made by the Chinese. The Tibet of the autonomous region is one third of Tibet. There is also the province of Sichuan, a large proportion of which is part of the historic Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who spoke before me discussed this. Three months ago, there was a sign of hope for some on the return of Kelsang Gyaltsen and Lodi Gyari, the Dalai Lama’s envoys who went on an official visit to Peking for the first time in a long while. Meanwhile, a small change has taken place in the People’s Republic of China. Hu Jintao has become the new President, the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party. The result of the so-called dialogue that was undertaken is these two death sentences: those of Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, Mrs Gebhardt, there could be better signs emerging from this dialogue. Having said that, I think that above all we should question ourselves, as members of the European Parliament and as Europeans, on how we are supporting the Tibetan people. I think that we should seriously ask that question. There is a risk of exoticism, and a risk that the peaceful struggle of our Tibetan friends will not be capable of achieving the objective of freeing Tibet. This is an objective for the Tibetans, but also for all free men and women across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly three years ago now, in June 2000, Parliament adopted a resolution inviting the governments of the Member States to recognise the exiled government of Tibet, the Dalai Lama’s government. I believe that is how we can genuinely give power to our Tibetan friends and show our Chinese friends that the rule of law is based on solid foundations of dialogue, and not just on semblances of dialogue, on the crumbs of dialogue that they throw to the Tibetans and to us, the Europeans, to make us believe, as they have been doing for 40 years, that they want dialogue while each time they reject real dialogue and any political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the exiled Tibetan Parliament, Professor Samdhong Rinpoche, has asked for restraint until June. I will restrain myself until June, but I think that from then on we should reconsider our entire approach to supporting the battle to free Tibet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are deeply concerned about the death sentence passed on Lobsang Dhondup and Tenzin Delek on 2 December. You may recall that Mr Delek was on the list of individual cases that we handed to the Chinese authorities under the human rights dialogue between the EU and China. The Commission is also concerned because these death sentences are the first to be passed against Tibetans because of alleged political crimes for some years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to take this opportunity to inform Parliament that the EU troika raised this matter through diplomatic channels with the Chinese authorities on 13 December, at embassy level. The EU requested information on both these cases and in particular on what evidence had been presented, and called for the trials to be reopened in accordance with international standards for fair trials. Furthermore, the troika reaffirmed that the EU rejects the death penalty and its use in China in general, referring to the ongoing campaign of ‘drastic action’. By virtue of this prompt intervention on the part of the European Union and because of pressure from the United States and Australia, the executions have so far not been carried out, and the two convicted men have entered appeals. The executions can therefore not be carried out until the People's Court has re-examined the case. Although we believe that the immediate danger of execution has been averted for the time being, the Commission will continue to follow this case very closely, particularly as regards the provision of solid evidence and guarantees of a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also continuing to put pressure on China to guarantee the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people. It has repeatedly called for the initiation of a direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, as this is likely to be the only way to secure a peaceful and lasting solution to the Tibetan question.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Commission is encouraged by the positive news conveyed by the two envoys of the Dalai Lama who visited China in September 2002. We hope that this will be a first step towards the establishment of a more regular dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama. The Commission intends to continue to take only such cooperative measures in Tibet as will directly benefit the Tibetan population.</p>
