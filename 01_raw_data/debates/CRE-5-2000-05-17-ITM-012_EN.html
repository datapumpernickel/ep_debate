<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paasilinna (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, deregulation in the telecommunications sector has continued for a decade and it has been a great success. The traditional telephone as we knew it is now a fading memory. In the past, people acquired a telephone in order to keep in touch with each other, but now they have become shareholders in a company, which could, for example, be acting as an intermediary in sexual services. I am sure this has come as a surprise to many. The instrument itself is so tiny that it could, for instance, be inadvertently placed in the mouth, being mistaken for false teeth; in this respect, too, things have changed a lot.</p>
<p class="contents">Deregulation created fears of a fall in standards of public services and an increase in telephone charges. This has not happened, however, and instead services have become diversified and prices have fallen. Money to finance all this has, of course, been generated by new data terminal equipment, networks and services. The 1988 regulatory package was well timed and – due to its efficient implementation – worked well in several Member States. In some countries, however, implementation has been slow and even formal. We would support action by the Commission to improve cross-border services and honest competition. We are concerned at the fact that the limited supply of user access has prevented many user groups – in particular those with lower resources – from taking full advantage of, for instance, reasonably affordable Internet access. Therefore, we need new alternative loop systems, we must facilitate the development of wireless local loop systems and also, for instance, the use of a cable TV network, without having to resort to specific legislation on this issue, however. Parliament notes that due to the variations in its implementations, the current regime has led to legal uncertainty in different Member States. Sufficient transparency on the specific conditions for operating licences is required, so that undue delays in the approval process can be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important reform strategy of the European Union is a reform initiative called <span class="italic">e</span>Europe, the framework of which was recently approved in Lisbon. The Commission must be congratulated on the fact that the structure and strategy of the European information society differ in a positive way from others in that it has not only taken account of competitiveness, but also of elements such as cohesion, social equality and employment. The objective is to prevent social discrimination and to increase consumer confidence and social cohesion. This initiative is impressively entitled: “An Information Society For All”.</p>
<p class="contents">The radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource which has now started to come up for auction. We take a negative view of this with the exception of certain special instances. We were aware, as early as two years ago, that the GSM auction in the USA had resulted in a state of chaos, i.e. bankruptcies. Experiences from India are equally bad. Those in favour of auctioning believe it to be a good means of controlling resources. We think it will lead to increases in user tariffs and delays in the spreading and development of communications services. Prices at auction have now become incredibly high, and these will be passed on to the consumers, resulting in a new telecommunications tax. This would be an unfair tax, in that it would be the same for both rich and poor. Now that the <span class="italic">e</span>Europe initiative – with all its worthy objectives – has just been approved, it is being obstructed by the imposition of a new ‘digital divide’, a greedy fee-charging principle. In practice, this means that our priority project, the development of an information society, is now being obstructed through taxation. This is cause for concern, which, in my opinion, should be looked into in greater detail. I therefore request that the Commission investigate, without delay, the impact of this, the auctioning principle, in different countries, in order that we should have more information on which to base our opinion. Furthermore, this principle will privilege big operators, who will start dividing up the market. In the end, there will be the fear that as we reduce regulations, i.e. deregulate, these big operators will make mutual agreements and ‘reregulate’, creating new regulations. This cannot be right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alyssandrakis (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of using the radio spectrum to transmit signals revolutionised telecommunications and new applications for the radio spectrum have been developed continuously ever since. Thus, we have progressed from the simple wireless telegraph to the digital transmission of sound and image, satellite navigation and the third generation of mobile telephones. I should like at this point to stress that the radio spectrum is not used solely for telecommunications. Apart from applications based on the transmission and reception of radio signals, there are also ‘passive’ applications which just receive signals emitted by natural phenomena. The main applications here are radio-astronomy, which studies natural phenomena beyond our planet on the basis of the radio waves which they emit, and Earth observation, both of which use the radio spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents">The constant increase in the demand for radio frequencies for new applications is such that we need to review the principles on which they are distributed and the policy which the European Union needs to apply in this sector. The European Commission responded to this need by publishing a Green Paper on Radio Spectrum Policy for public consultation at the end of 1998. It subsequently issued the communication which we are examining today on the basis of the aforementioned public consultation. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, having expressed its satisfaction with the work of the European Commission, has come to a number of conclusions and has formulated a number of principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting from the premise that the spectrum is a valuable but scarce natural resource and that the demand for it is rising constantly, it stresses that it must be used efficiently in order to best serve the public interest and help develop new high-quality services. In this respect, the Committee on Industry considers that spectrum policy cannot be solely market-driven, that the economic and social value of the radio spectrum should not be assessed on the basis of profit opportunity and that we need a balanced combination of commercial and social interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry also stresses that specific measures need to be taken in order to guarantee a satisfactory number of frequencies for public and private radio and television broadcasts, for amateur radio operators, for navigation systems and for passive applications, such as radio-astronomy and Earth observation. The Committee on Industry accepts the proposal of the European Commission to create a Spectrum Policy Expert Group having a purely advisory role and transparent internal structure and modus operandi. However, although it acknowledges that it would be advisable to further harmonise Community radio spectrum policy to an extent, as far as pan-European services and applications are concerned, it does not accept the European Commission’s proposal for a new regulatory framework at pan-European level, considering this to be both premature and hurried.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to one issue which seriously worried the Committee on Industry and which Mr Paasilinna mentioned just now. I refer to the degree to which the principle of spectrum pricing, auctioning and the introduction of a secondary market should be adopted. Your rapporteur takes the view that radio frequencies per se should not be bought and sold, because this would result in frequencies’ being diverted from their intended purpose. Other practices, such as auctions and a secondary market, would result, with mathematical accuracy, in the prevalence of stronger economic interests, which would then monopolise the market. Your rapporteur is in favour of an overall payment for each commercial service which uses the spectrum. The Committee on Industry did not adopt my view and, although not in favour of auctions in all cases, considers that they could be applied for commercial uses.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out to members that the results of the recent auction of radio frequencies for third generation mobile telephones in the United Kingdom have given rise to second thoughts on the subject. The huge sums paid will not come out of the companies’ profits; they will be paid for by users. I have heard that in the United Kingdom, in order to find the money paid at auction, every man, woman and child will need to spend 400 pounds a year on telephone calls. We must not lose sight of the consequences which such practices will have on the final user. I therefore call upon the House to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 4, 12, 5 and 6, so that our final resolution includes a clear position against auctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has drawn up not only a very concise but also a very hard-hitting report. It is entirely appropriate as a response to the telecommunications communication from the Commission and exactly what we needed to give us a basis on which to move into our further consideration of the whole electronic communications package, which we shall be debating again in a month's time.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus on some of the key points highlighted in the report. I am going to leave issues on radio spectrum policy to my colleague, Mrs Niebler, who will be responding on behalf of our Group to Mr Alyssandrakis’ report.</p>
<p class="contents">Just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market. The first and most encouraging thing from our point of view is that we now see the wisdom of opening the telecommunications market. To have an open competitive regime has now become the accepted wisdom. It is something that is fully accepted and we now need to translate that and move that forward as quickly as possible, towards further deregulation and even quicker opening of those markets that still work imperfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a tremendous amount of detailed analysis in this report and it clearly shows the consumer benefits in price reductions, choice and increased services that have flowed from deregulation. However, it also clearly shows that there are far too many barriers, and the Commission has our full support in tackling them.</p>
<p class="contents">For consumers to benefit from this choice, they have to be encouraged to shop around, to compare in many cases what can be quite complex offers of prices and contract terms and service packages. We would like to encourage independent regulators to work together to provide simple, impartial price comparisons for consumers and use the sort of new tools they have available, like the Internet, to give consumers the ability to calculate the real cost of their calls. We encourage the regulators to share best practice with each other to provide a unified price and contract comparison system.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not have a developed market unless we have investment. The other issue we have to address is the ability of investors to make satisfactory returns on their investment. Therefore, in looking at the market-opening regulations, we have to look at methods of competition and encourage competition between the different parts and elements of the platforms. That is something we shall address in the next communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome this report, which is really going to encourage market-opening to the benefit of consumers and the European economy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Glante (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Commissioner Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to comment on the Alyssandrakis report on the Commission communication concerning radio spectrum policy. This communication and the report on the communication are amongst Parliament’s reports on the telecommunications sector, and they are all very closely linked. I could mention the report by Mrs Thors, which we are to vote on in the near future, and the reports by Mr van Velzen and Mr Paasilinna, who has just spoken, as well as that of Mr Alyssandrakis.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to again express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and those responsible within the groups, for the inter-group cooperation in this matter. Unlike grid-bound infrastructure, frequencies cannot be multiplied ad infinitum. As such, they should be treated as a special case. Radio spectrum policy is gaining in importance within the European Union, but also worldwide, in connection with new technologies – UMTS has been mentioned – but also in connection with the famous ‘making it through the last mile’, so as to create some movement in charges for local phone calls.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The granting of licences – whether by auction or by ‘beauty contest’ – is regulated, and as previous speakers have mentioned, the United Kingdom has had first experience of this and results are now available. Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis made reference to this. Auctions can lead to high prices. It is also suspected in Germany that high prices are achieved at auction. Several of my colleagues in my Group are concerned because they suspect that the high figures achieved at auctions, plus the investment that has to be made in this sector, will inevitably lead to the overall cost being passed on to consumers. This may well be the case. However, one thing I would point out is that even when the average weighted rate of VAT was introduced, the first mobile phones were expensive, and the charges were very high. However, increasing market penetration brought the prices down.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should appeal to the national governments to use the proceeds from the auctions held in these sectors for the implementation of the information society and for broadening the basis thereof in the Member States. This is a cue for me to mention the ‘Schools on-line’ or ‘Public administration and libraries on-line’ programme that we have called for repeatedly. I feel that the average EU citizen interested in using the Internet is bound to continue using PCs at home, in the library or in the office. I do not think they will be clamouring to be the first to use the UMTS equipment.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proceeds from the auctions will be able to ease the burden on Member States’ budgets, which will – and I am digressing slightly from our specialist technical subject now – give politics renewed power to act. As such, I believe the governments are quite justified in receiving the proceeds. I hope that my fellow delegates will endorse Amendment No 8 tabled by my Group. Unfortunately, we are unable to support any of the others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was no such consensus previously. To my great delight, I note that it is liberals who have been in the vanguard of this change: Commissioner Bangemann, together with Finland’s former Minister for Transport, Mr Norrback, who was among the first ministers to liberalise this sector. </p>
<p class="contents">I would point out, for example, that, last year, we in Finland noted that GSM prices were, on average, seven per cent lower. Even foreign calls were ten per cent lower than previously. We are therefore still making quite large strides in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that, in the future, we shall be able to conduct a similar open dialogue with the Commission regarding development within this sector. The Commission is undertaking many investigations and inquiries. We need impartial information to be able to keep track of developments and, as public decision makers, to be able to take the necessary decisions. </p>
<p class="contents">These two reports deal with issues both large and small. In common with previous speakers, I would express my appreciation of the constructive cooperation that has taken place with the rapporteurs. The major issues are about the ways in which broadband services can be made available to everyone and about the auctions we have touched upon. Clearly, it is up to each Member State to decide upon its strategy for obtaining networks with high transmission speeds for everyone. However, we wish today to offer vigorous support to the Commission’s recommendation that dominant network operators should be responsible for permitting combined services all the way to the subscribers. In certain Member States, that is already the case, for example in my own country, Finland. Even there, consideration might be given to going further by introducing a situation in which dominant operators become responsible for hiring out the telecommunications companies’ premises for the purpose of housing equipment. I think we need to see to it that we utilise existing capacity as far as possible and obtain better service and, in that way, lower prices. </p>
<p class="contents">The auctions issue has provoked discussion and does so every day. One might well wonder if it is a question here of being penny wise and pound foolish. Apart from the risk of the auction prices for third generation mobile telephones putting the brakes on development, there are two other matters I should like to emphasise. There is a risk of roaming for third generation mobile telephony being put in jeopardy. There may also be a risk of barriers arising between the Member States. I would therefore hope that the Commission is alert to this question and that we can engage in a creative discussion on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in Europe, we once again failed to take much notice of our thinkers and, in the meantime, over the last decade, the United States has increased its GDP and income per capita to above European Union levels, where, in the last year, these indicators represented barely 75% of US levels. While half of the world’s internet users are American and 44% of US homes have direct access to the networks, in Europe that proportion is barely 15%.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now rapidly turning to the information society, information technology, the Internet, the Galileo network for monitoring and intercommunication by satellite, the liberalisation and convergence of telecommunications and technological advances in general.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons I would like to call for the prompt transposition in all Member States of all the directives relating to radio-broadcasting and voice telephony, the interconnection and maintenance of digitisation, general authorisations and licences, leased lines, open networks, mobile telephones and data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we should condemn the fact that the national regulatory authorities of certain countries – such as Spain, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom – are not playing their part to the full, which has led to complaints from new companies, who have found that the telecommunications monopolies that already exist are placing obstacles in their way and delaying the consolidation of free competition to the detriment of users.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we ask that, as soon as possible, flat rates be established for access to the Internet, to the network of networks, and we even argue that they should be free, since they should be offered, like health and education, as an essential public service to the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the stock markets, there is a ‘gold rush’ for the shares of IT companies – IT shares are a present-day Klondyke. The reports by Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis emphasise the necessity of rules even for gold prospecting: if the common and public interest is not secured, the richest, largest and fastest players will take all, and they will reap all the fruits of the new technological developments. A rapid concentration of the information industry is in progress – at the consumers’ expense. The battle over market shares for next generation mobile phone frequencies, for example, will raise consumer prices sky high. As we know, the profit from these shares will ultimately always be generated through the prices of telephone calls. We must now ensure that public interest is secured – as proposed by Mr Alyssandrakis – and ensure the availability of sufficient frequency bands for use by public broadcasting. This will not be possible if such a restricted natural resource as the radio spectrum is auctioned off for the monopolised use of the highest bidding major companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The results of the auctions in third generation mobile phone frequencies, the ‘UMTS’ frequencies, that are currently taking place in several Member States, demonstrate just how important frequencies are, particularly as far as the economy is concerned. Mr Paasilinna and other speakers have already touched on this matter. In Great Britain, mobile phone operators were forced to pay a total of EUR 38.5 billion for frequencies. In Germany, proceeds from auctions are expected to total EUR 50 to 60 billion. This development has come as a complete surprise to everyone. The auctions were supposed to yield a tenth of the aforementioned figure. The market could have borne this quite satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Current developments on the auction front give cause for serious concern to my mind. The companies are being deprived of the financial basis they need to make investments in infrastructure and new innovations. In addition, the operators are unable to offer their customers inexpensive mobile access to the Internet. Yet it is precisely this that was recently thought could offer us the possibility to make up ground in the competition with the USA. What is more, some practices in the Member States – either auctions or ‘beauty contests’ that is – in respect of these billions, lead to distortion of competition in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Certain governments are evidently prepared to jeopardise the development of the mobile phone sector, which is one of Europe’s industries of the future, for the sake of overhauling national budgets. Commissioner Liikanen, may I ask you quite openly, how the European Commission views this development? Do you think there is a need for action at European level? In principle, I believe auctions for commercial purposes to be an excellent alternative, let there be no mistake about that. But I sill feel that the way auctions for UMTS licences are shaping up gives us good cause to rethink the ‘pure doctrine’.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I have the following brief comments to make on the report itself: in my view, three priorities for revising radio spectrum policy have crystallised from the debate, which we also had in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Mr Alyssandrakis also highlights them in the report. Firstly, the European institutions must be better represented at world radio conferences. Secondly, the Community must be allowed to express itself during negotiations within the CEPT, the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations that is, in such a way that better account is taken of Community interests where radio spectrum policy is concerned. Thirdly, the Commission must be able to demand that the Member States release the frequencies needed for the pan-European services and applications decided by the Council and Parliament, at an early stage and without hitches. Appropriate instructions should be drafted to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since then, this decision has led to the adoption of a series of directives, and we have constantly been reminded that there is a political objective underlying these regulations, namely growth, employment, competitiveness and the provision of access to the information society for all citizens, with the necessary legal protection. </p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission has performed its monitoring role and produced a raft of reports, and the communication we are discussing today is part of this undertaking. I must say that the assessment presented to us is, at least, detailed. Although, during the two years since the market was completely opened up, the telecommunications market has been characterised by growth, newcomers to the market and some price reductions, nonetheless, gaps have also appeared which are serious to say the very least, including what is known as the digital divide between regions and between citizens caused by the cost of accessing these new services and, along with this divide, the exclusion of some citizens or regions from the new technology society. It is therefore imperative that we do not lose sight of the objective of providing a high-quality service for all citizens if we want to avoid creating a fresh division within our society. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, today we are debating reducing the cost of Internet access within the framework of local loop competition. The objective is admirable, but we must avoid certain errors and must, therefore, discuss the matter very thoroughly with the national authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would stress the need to simplify the rules, as well as consumer protection, the role of the national regulatory authorities and the licensing system which has been discussed at great length. Finally, opening up the market is not an end in itself: it is a means of ensuring that the transition to an information society is made by and for all citizens through the creation of permanent jobs, and this is certainly not always the case in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commission has stated, there has been a lot of progress in the past few years in the EU telecommunications sector, but there is still a lot to be learnt where the mobile phone market is concerned. For instance, the availability of carrier pre-selection should be considered, and this facility made available to consumers, if studies confirm that they are going to benefit from this pre-selection. In future, it is incumbent on the Commission to ensure more vigorously than ever that the ‘roaming’ fees charged to users by operators are brought down in all EU countries to a sensible level based on actual costs. At the same time, the Commission must ensure that the fees collected from the operators remain under control. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s operating logic thus falls into two stages. The operators are not allowed to collect fees from the users, but neither must the public authority collect from the operators. The costs to the operator might become unreasonably high, should the new generation mobile spectrum be auctioned. Auctioning may also distort competition, if operators start making ‘tactical’ bids for the spectrum in order to harm the position of their competitors at auction. Therefore ‘beauty contests’ between the various operators are clearly more consumer-friendly alternatives. The latest UMTS auction in Great Britain, where prices soared sky high, will, in any case, set the alarm bells ringing. After the hammer has gone down, it is always the consumer who foots the bill – and that is exactly what we do not want, all of us being consumers ourselves. If we also want to introduce the Internet into schools and libraries and make it available for everybody on a very large scale in future, and if we also want to utilise its future potential in competition with the USA, the Internet will have to be affordable to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to comment on both reports in a very few, but I hope, significant respects.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Paasilinna’s report, I want to comment, and perhaps ask the Commission to comment on the whole question of the balance between regulation and liberalisation. Mr Caudron touched on this in his remarks to the effect that the benefits of liberalisation have been felt disproportionately in the business community and those who make long distance and national calls while domestic consumers have benefited much less, particularly those who make very few calls, or people who live on their own. I want to ask the Commissioner about the speed of regulation and the purpose of regulation. It was good to see the Commission taking very urgent action, for example, in respect of leased line and the charges for leased lines where the existing legislation had not been properly implemented. The differences in attitude, ethos, resources and the degree of independence among the national regulators are still a cause for concern.</p>

It is a pleasure to achieve high returns but frustrating when one knows that the sale proceeds in fact represent a voluntary form of early taxation. I believe we should learn from the auctions in Great Britain in this respect. The people who applied for these licences actually missed a nought off in their calculations. They had to pay over ten times the anticipated amount for the licences. I believe that will have a distorting effect on competition in the long run, because other companies that only have to face a ‘beauty contest’ can now pursue a considerably more aggressive price policy of course, and will ultimately be able to take over illiquid telecommunications firms. We therefore need to examine the opportunities and risks associated with the various forms of allocation without delay.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is for the Commission to perform the important task of analysing the auction results and the effects thereof, and make a real point of asking those who buy licences at auction whether they are aware of the risks that the legislature still has on the table. It is not known how the legislature will support the universal service in the future. Our Group is in fact against this for the mobile phone sector. All the same, it is not known what is in the pipeline, for example, in connection with number portability or data protection. I could list a whole host of things that the legislature could still come up with and that would present a considerable risk to auctions. I feel that one should, of course, consider stock market prices as well. If a company in Spain takes part in a ‘beauty contest’ without serious intent, and pays very little for a licence, then of course this company’s shares will rise accordingly on the stock exchange. This means increased liquidity and market imbalances. Companies that pay dearly for licences, on the other hand, and do not have this opportunity, may very quickly go into a tailspin on the stock exchange. Therefore, if auctions are here to stay, we must call for a regulatory framework to be put in place. One idea would be to earmark the revenue from these auctions for boosting investment in education and training. One could promote research and development investment, concentrating on start-up companies, or small and family businesses, particularly those involved in the development of telecommunications, Internet and multimedia programmes. Finally, we could, of course, promote the infrastructure needed to bring on competitive cabling, networks and hardware development too. Just transferring the proceeds to the national budgets, however, does not seem to me to be enough! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis on their very timely and invaluable work. As part of an on-going exercise of monitoring by the Commission, the Fifth Report sets the scene for many of the conclusions and recommendations made in the communication’s review, which was issued at the same time, and on which we, and the European Parliament, are working right now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paasilinna’s report inevitably touches on some of the issues to be addressed by the final proposals, which we will discuss here again next month.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares many of the concerns expressed in Mr Paasilinna’s report on the current regulatory situation. They are vitally important for the uptake of the information society, for the development of the Internet, e-commerce and m-commerce – mobile commerce. They offer unbundled access to the local loop, facilitating developments in licensing, co-location, carrier pre-selection and the independence and the powers of national regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is addressing many of these problems which you identify at the moment. It has the very recent recommendation on the local loop and on bundling. The Commission will also use its powers in regard to competition to monitor carefully dominant positions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made a revised recommendation on interconnection pricing and now we have on-going enforcement measures and infringement proceedings, for example, against a number of Member States on carrier pre-selection and local tariff structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Pending the adoption of the new framework, which will be presented in June, the Commission will continue to press for effective implementation of the current rules. This is called for by market players, national regulators and national administrations and has now also been unanimously mandated by the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Commission is preparing the sixth framework report to be adopted during 2000. Parliament’s report will provide important input. I am sure that the report will be an important benchmark as we follow the development of the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Cable systems will be examined more closely by the Commission. We already have a policy of pushing for divestment of cable TV networks to ensure greater local competition and to stimulate investments and services, as Parliament is calling for in these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the radio spectrum issue and the report of Mr Alyssandrakis, I agree that radio spectrum is an increasingly scarce and valuable resource. It is used in many policy areas of concern for the EU, such as telecoms, broadcasting, transport, research and development, which are all very important for the European economy. For that reason, the Commission proposes a harmonised approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobile and wireless communications develop at a rapid pace and the unexpectedly high results of spectrum licence auctioning in the UK show the growing importance of the sector. Furthermore, the messages of the spectrum Green Paper demonstrate the need to address certain radio spectrum issues at Community level and to reach a balance between various user sectors. Second, Community action on the radio spectrum is beneficial if taken within a clear regulatory framework. In addition, political support is required to facilitate the achievement of Community objectives at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the on-going radio conference in Istanbul where issues like Galileo or third generation spectrum will be discussed. The Commission therefore welcomes the report from Mr Alyssandrakis. As this report calls for a radio spectrum policy, which fulfils Community policies, further harmonisation of radio spectrum is necessary. We have to see development of information and communications technologies and a balance between all spectrum needs including private and public interest. The competitiveness of European industry at global level must be developed in the interest of the European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission would like to stress that it is urgent and not premature to have an appropriate framework at the Community level to implement the spectrum policy options agreed in the Spectrum policy group and to ensure that results of harmonisation mandates are implemented in the Union. We should be able to promote without delay harmonisation measures which respond to technological and market developments. The Commission will report annually to the Council and the European Parliament on the measures adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as further actions are concerned, the Commission will present by the end of June – after Parliament’s discussions and the votes on the radio reports – the appropriate framework for radio spectrum policy in the EC. This will also take into account the results of the overall discussion which is now taking place in the 1999 review.</p>
<p class="contents">We well understand the debate on auction prices which have received a lot of attention here. According to the present new rules, the Commission must recognise the authority of Member States to choose their preferred spectrum licensing method, whether it is the administrative or auction method, but the Commission will closely monitor developments to avoid distortion of competition and ensure the implementation of the licensing directive and also technological and service developments in the interest of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Read put a question about the balance between competition and regulation. I would say that we need regulation to push for competition because otherwise bottlenecks can actually prevent competition which can help citizens because it will be the incentive for lower prices and higher quality services. But there are areas where we also have a major public policy interest, especially in regard to universal service and data privacy. In those areas the Commission will make proposals in the context of the new legislation on electronic communications which will be presented at the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission also intends defining this balance between the markets and public policy in the context of the Europe Action Plan, which should be presented next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the coherence of the licensing arrangements is concerned, we must ensure there will be no distortion of competition and guarantee the implementation of the licensing directive. This whole discussion is very important for defining the content of the new electronic communications legislation, and I am sure these issues will not be the concern of only a few passionate expert parliamentarians as is the case today – electronic communications will be a major political issue in the years to come.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
