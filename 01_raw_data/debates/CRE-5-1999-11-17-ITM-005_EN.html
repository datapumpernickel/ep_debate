<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I was just reflecting for a moment on those points of order. I am sure that Members of Parliament can imagine my own feelings about events in the last forty-eight hours in Northern Ireland. I think we have a better chance for peace than has existed for some time and I for one would salute the courage of those parties and party leaders who have made these encouraging developments possible. We must all keep our fingers crossed and, where appropriate, perhaps pray.</p>
<p class="contents">To move to the debate: I am extremely pleased to be able to participate in this important debate and I must say that I am very grateful to the business managers for arranging the timing before my departure to the OSCE Summit. I hope the House will not regard it as a discourtesy if I am obliged to leave just before the end of the debate but I have to get to Istanbul, not least for a meeting on the Stability Pact. The debate provides a useful opportunity for me to inform the House of our most recent contacts with the Russian authorities over events in Chechnya. At the same time, I shall be able to participate in the discussions in Istanbul on these issues with a much clearer understanding of the views of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that there is general consensus in the European Union – the Council, the Parliament and the Commission – on the following two propositions: firstly, whatever the understandable outrage about the appalling acts of terrorism in Moscow, in the northern Caucasus and elsewhere – which, as someone whose country has had all too much experience of terrorism, I totally condemn – Russian action over recent weeks has involved repeated disproportionate military force, repeated disregard for the need to seek a political solution and repeated disregard for the tragic human consequences. Secondly, most people (I think this is also true across the European Union) agree that it would be a historic error to begin the next century by locking Russia out of European affairs as we did at the beginning of this century. Because we want to avoid repeating the mistakes made after 1917, the European Union has been genuinely seeking a strategic partnership with Russia. The concrete proof is the dialogue that we have built up under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the common strategy adopted at the Cologne European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally obvious that the unfolding situation in Chechnya puts our relations with Russia under considerable strain. The Russian authorities must understand that their present action has an impact on their acceptance by the international community and on Russia’s credibility as a political and economic partner. They seek to justify their action in terms of domestic public opinion. It is the same story when they refuse to give ground on the European Union’s legitimate trade concerns despite the EUR 10 billion trade surplus they now enjoy with us.</p>
<p class="contents">But we live in democratic countries with democratic institutions like this Parliament. We too are affected by the strength of public opinion which is understandably horrified by what is happening in Chechnya and worried about simply standing on the sidelines. So far, our response has been to try to exert growing diplomatic and political pressure on the Russians. We have taken every opportunity to get the message across at all levels. I participated in the ministerial troika led by Foreign Minister Halonen in early October. The subject dominated the European Union-Russia Summit on 22 October and it dominated our discussion at the General Affairs Council on Monday. At each stage the language has been hardened and the operational proposals reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The message from the Council this week could not be more clear. The European Union has condemned outright all disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya and urged the Russian government to observe its commitments under humanitarian law. There is no alternative to seeking a negotiated settlement based on a dialogue with the elected leaders of the northern Caucasus, including Chechnya. The Council stressed that imposing a military solution in Chechnya would be a major political mistake. What will be the situation in one month, two months, a year or two years from now? There is apparently no long-term Russian strategy to ensure lasting peace. More specifically, the Council urged a role for the OSCE and asked that a branch office of the OSCE assistance group to Chechnya should be immediately opened in Nazran and Ingushetia. The Council concluded that the Istanbul Summit this Thursday and Friday could be used, inter alia, to drive home these messages to the Russian authorities. I am obviously willing to return to Parliament after Istanbul to report on the message we delivered and the reaction we received.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasingly I am being asked whether the European Union should step up the pressure by moving beyond strong words to more direct action. What might this involve? Some suggest cutting off financial assistance under the TACIS programme. Would this, I ask, put a stop to military action? There would be no direct impact on Russia’s public finances because the money is all channelled through contractors mainly in the European Union. But it would undermine the process of economic and social modernisation that we have been pressing for so hard.</p>
<p class="contents">What about suspending food aid? The existing scheme is nearing an end. By September over 90% of supplies had already been delivered to Russia. It is now for the Russian authorities to ensure distribution. The priority for us is to check that the proceeds of the scheme are properly used to repay pension arrears and for other social projects. As for the future, we have anyway very grave doubts about the need and the economic rationale for any new food aid schemes. Recent events in Chechnya add a strong political argument against meeting any new Russian request for food aid. I told Madeline Albright last week that I did not believe that this Parliament would countenance any further delivery of new food aid this winter to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">There have also been suggestions of withholding IMF assistance and EBRD lending. These are obviously issues beyond the direct competence of the European Union, but would it be in our interests to provoke a political backlash against the international community in the run-up to the Duma elections in December?</p>
<p class="contents">The OSCE meeting in Istanbul provides an opportunity for progress, although I cannot claim to be very optimistic. The Russians have made it plain that domestic public opinion is dominating other considerations in their handling of the crisis. Our job must be to persuade them their present short-sighted approach will never deliver lasting peace in the Caucasus, and we need to be swift and generous in providing the humanitarian assistance that is so badly needed as winter sets in. We will be more effective on both these fronts while channels of communication remain open. I am therefore, like the Presidency and the High Representative, in close contact with Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister. We met in Helsinki last week in the margins of the Northern Dimension Conference and we have since spoken on the telephone.</p>
<p class="contents">On the urgent humanitarian situation, I have repeatedly stressed the need to ensure adequate access and security for international aid agencies. Some progress has been possible through recent assessment missions by outside experts and donors. This has allowed a better estimate of the extent of humanitarian aid needs. There appear to be up to 200,000 Chechen refugees now in Ingushetia, most of them staying with families there, the remainder living in tents. Meanwhile a large number of people are waiting to cross the border and many have returned to Chechnya, either to the area occupied by the Russian military or to that still under control of the Chechen fighters. In total, we are talking about up to half a million people to a greater or lesser extent in need of humanitarian assistance. The needs of the local population in Ingushetia who have been hosting the refugees must also be taken into account. Identifying needs is only one part of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The physical delivery of assistance is another. Continuing security worries have limited assistance efforts so far. From the Commission ECHO has committed close to one million euros to the work of the UNHCR. The large-scale assistance urgently required in this region cannot be delivered through remote control with donors excessively dependent on the Russian Ministry for Emergencies. We must therefore maintain pressure on the Russian authorities to do much more to facilitate access for international donors and to look after their safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should say that Mr Ivanov has suggested in his conversations with me that an intensification of the contacts between the European Parliament and the Duma might be helpful, including perhaps a visit to Moscow by a representative group of your Members. Obviously you would want to see for yourselves what was going on and make your own judgements. I know that under the admirable leadership of Mrs Krehl, your Delegation for relations with Russia is among the most active in the Parliament, but I would urge you to consider Mr Ivanov’s suggestion seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is keen to see a constructive relationship between the Russian Federation and the European Union. We have a shared interest in the future security and prosperity of our continent. But I have to say that the present crisis in Chechnya is putting a severe strain on the partnership we have been trying to build. On the other hand, we all know that it is only by trying to maintain that partnership that we have any chance of getting the Russians to heed our message, that is the awful dilemma that we face. The Russians must recognise that they cannot dismiss our concerns out of hand. We want closer friendship and understanding but they must recognise that those things are a two-way street. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can fully agree with the points he raised. This autumn we have followed daily, with growing concern, the continued military action in Chechnya. Of particular worry is the fact that the Russian government has still not – despite its promises – begun to look for a political solution to the crisis but, instead, relies solely on military action. Moscow’s political goals regarding Chechnya in the longer term are still obscure.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the European Parliament’s interest in the situation in Chechnya. I would now briefly like to tell you of our assessment, firstly of the military crisis in Chechnya and, secondly of the humanitarian crisis there. Thirdly, I will speak about the action taken thus far by the European Union and the international community, and the aims we have for Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Militarily, Russia controls just under half the Chechen territory, and is advancing systematically. On Friday last week, Russia took the city of Gudermes and may also in time take Grozny. Russia’s apparent aim is to bring the whole of Chechnya back under Russian control. For Prime Minister Putin, the war has also so far been an internal political success.</p>
<p class="contents">During the autumn the European Union has repeated its concern regarding the disproportionate use of force in Chechnya. This has caused a number of civilian victims and an ever-continuing increase in the number of internal refugees. The use of force against civilians is prohibited under international humanitarian law. Through its action, Russia is in violation of the Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol. Indiscriminate bombing has been responsible for many civilian victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has underlined the need for rapid de-escalation of the conflict and urged Russia to commence negotiations for a lasting solution to the problem. It is clear that a basically political conflict cannot be solved militarily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The images of refugee encampments covered in snow are a grim reminder of the plight of those who have had to flee their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">Under humanitarian law, the victims of internal conflicts have a right to humanitarian aid. Russia has an obligation to guarantee that the aid reaches its destination unhindered. The EU has called on Russia to ensure that aid gets through quickly and unhindered, so that a humanitarian catastrophe may be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council this week adopted a resolution, which once again focused on the disproportionate and arbitrary use of military action, the suffering of the civilian population and the need to start talks to achieve a political solution. In the resolution the Union urges Russia to acknowledge its commitments to international humanitarian law, to make use of the excellent services of the OSCE and to guarantee that international humanitarian aid arrives at its destination. The EU also repeated its position on Russia’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this autumn, the Russian leadership, at its meeting with the EU and representatives of EU countries, assured us that Russia would seek a political solution. Prime Minister Putin did just that at the EU/Russia summit meeting in Helsinki on 22 October. We have to stress to Russia that we expect it to keep its word and look for a political, not a military, solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has said its actions are to do with the combating of terrorism. In its opinions, the EU has always condemned terrorism in all its forms. At the same time, however, the EU has emphasised that anti-terrorist action must always be in compliance with the dictates of human rights. It considers that violence towards civilians carried out in the name of the fight against terrorism is never acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the administrative border between Ingushetia and Chechnya remains open so that the civilian population fleeing Chechnya can safely reach the Ingushetian side. Civilians must be guaranteed unhindered, cross-border access to refuge from the bombing and the violence. To deny these civilians their basic rights in a conflict situation would be a breach of international humanitarian law. The EU has tried to see to it that the border remains open and that everyone in need of assistance and protection can cross it.</p>
<p class="contents">Visits to the area by various delegations – Foreign Minister Halonen (30 October), UN organisations (3 – 7 November) and the OSCE (9 – 10 November) – can be regarded as positive steps. The visits to the area have been a means not only to acquire more information but also to make the concerns of the international community more visible. </p>
<p class="contents">For the international community to be able to have an impact on the situation we should endeavour to have an international presence in the northern Caucasus. The most natural context for this would be the OSCE. We must aim to establish in Nazran, Ingushetia, the OSCE’s Grozny mission, which has now been evacuated to Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">With winter approaching, we must do our utmost to make arrangements to see that international humanitarian aid reaches its destination. The humanitarian situation in the region looks very worrisome. The UN report reinforces the picture we have of a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must point out that it is in the interests of both the EU and Russia that military action be ceased as quickly as possible, because prolonging it would harm the relations that are only just developing between the EU and Russia. We will follow the situation closely and continue to put pressure on Russia, so that a lasting and peaceful solution can be found to the situation in Chechnya. The next opportunity for this – as Commissioner Patten mentioned – is the OSCE Summit starting tomorrow in Istanbul. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is with relief that we heard this morning the very firm position adopted on the matter by Mr Solana and his undertaking to bring his weight to bear, as of this afternoon in Istanbul, in order to ensure that international law and human dignity is respected in this part of the world, and it is with relief that we have just heard you tell us, Mr Patten, that you are shortly to add your contribution to that of Mr Solana in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We were, in fact, in the majority in this House in condemning the methods adopted by the Russian army to quash under fire any sort of potential resistance to its advance without taking into consideration the losses thereby caused among the civilian population. We were also in the majority in deploring, together with the majority of public opinion in Europe, the striking contrast between the din of the bombing and the sustained silence of the governments of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can bear witness to this because yesterday, I chaired a meeting of all the groups of this Parliament where a draft joint resolution was finalised which, unlike others, will not be a compromise text and will in no way be a compromise between divergent positions, but will indeed be a synthesis enriched by the proposals of each of the political families united in a common desire to offer Parliament’s contribution to a political solution of the tragic situation currently causing bloodshed in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">In this resolution, which I have no doubt will be massively supported by my fellow Members, we are adding our voices to those of the Council in condemning the action currently being taken and in requesting that negotiations are initiated directly with the elected representatives of the population of Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with you, we are requesting that the necessary humanitarian aid be deployed immediately, in order to provide assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people displaced due to this conflict, but we are requesting, Mr Patten, that provision is made for the suspension of economic aid to Russia, initially, if Russia continues with its indiscriminate attacks upon the civilian population and does not seek a negotiated settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand, and we hope with all our hearts that the task of negotiation which you are going to enter into, together with Mr Solana, will be successful. We also propose, and we are agreed upon this, I am sure, that a conference should be held, and that Parliament should participate in this conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important to underline what we say in the motion for a resolution, namely that we are committed to strengthening the partnership with Russia because we realise that there will be no stable, peaceful Europe without a stable and democratic Russia. We also underline the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. But it is the strategic partnership agreement that also gives us formal grounds, apart from our reactions as human beings, to question what is going on. The Tacis agreement states specifically that Tacis assistance is provided on the basis of certain shared economic and political values and practices. This is why we have also raised the issue of Tacis here. We do it against the background that some weeks ago the Russian Duma gave Mr Putin an increase of USD 1 billion for the war effort in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we also demand the highest degree of transparency on the part of any financial institutions or donors of funds to Russia. We also urge the Council and the Commission to consider freezing all new contracts under the Tacis programme, except the democracy line. This is a warning. We are not only concerned about the question of Chechnya; we are outraged, horrified. We want to add our voice and express our strong concern about what is going on and use the weight we have in Parliament, which we can do, among other things, through the Tacis programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The clear basis of the resolution is the support for Russian territorial integrity. The Russian government is also supported to the extent that we condemn terrorism in all its forms. On the other hand, we also condemn the excessive use of force and we are calling for a political solution to be sought for the Chechen question. In addition, we wish to emphasise that the civilian population must be protected and the refugees taken good care of.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position complies with the resolutions we adopted earlier and it is also in harmony with the policy pursued by Western countries. On the other hand, the line adopted by Parliament apparently contradicts public opinion among the citizens of the Member States. The European Parliament’s policy on Chechnya is encumbered by the fact that Western countries have themselves acted in such a way that they have lost the moral authority to clearly condemn the blunders Russia is presently accused of. This is shown, for example, in the article by Prime Minister Putin, recently published in the Herald Tribune, in which he defends his government’s action with reference to examples offered by Western countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The particular burden that the West bears now is the war against Yugoslavia. The bombing began without sufficient consideration being given to the objectives and consequences. In Kosovo a war of independence was going on, associated with violence against the civilian population. The West interposed in this war with a bombing campaign against one side, and on behalf of the other, although they had not approved the objectives of the side on behalf of which they had started the war. As no one wanted or was able to use ground troops in the war, the bombing meant that a humanitarian and political crisis became a humanitarian and political catastrophe. If Western policy were consistent, these countries would now be considering the defence of Chechnya, even through military means, but nobody even thinks about it. Now it is considered that Russia has the right to defend its own country’s unity, even through the use of very harsh measures. On the other hand, Russia is now appealing to the notion that it has the right to use military force to achieve its own important political aims in the same way as Western countries did in Yugoslavia. Despite our own moral burden, the European Union must use all its authority to solve the Chechen crisis according to the guidelines the representatives of the Council and the Commission have laid down here.</p>
<p class="contents">As we develop a common foreign, security and defence policy for the Union, we must see to it that it has a sound moral basis. Only in that way will we have the authority to insist that others should act in accordance with these principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us forget the hypocrisy and the double talk. The Russian policy being carried out in Chechnya is an old tactic. It is founded upon the Stalinist policy which shoved whole populations behind the Urals, without the right to return home, twenty or thirty years ago. And if we say that we do not wish to exclude Russia from Europe, that is true. But when the Russians say that this is an internal problem, we must tell them that today we all live in the same world, with shared values. And it is in the name of such values that we declare that we have an entitlement to political intervention, humanitarian intervention, in the face of this Russian barbarism.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, there has been terrorism. But who committed these acts of terrorism in Moscow? Do we know? Russian history claimed that Katyn was an atrocity committed by the Germans, until it was discovered that it was in fact committed by the Russians. I do not know who committed the terrible criminal acts in Russia, but I do know that the women and children of Chechnya who are being massacred today surely did not commit acts of terrorism. This is why, when we Europeans say that we are freezing aid to Russia, it is not with the intention of excluding Russia, but of integrating it into a shared system of values. Let us not give in to the blackmail which says "if we do not help Yeltsin or Putin, then we will have worse", for what could be worse than the annihilation of Grozny and the annihilation of Chechnya? Do you think that Mr Lebed or any other crazy man would do something other than this?</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am asking the Council and the Commission to be honest in saying to the Russians that if they do not change their policy, then we shall change our aid policy. Obviously, we shall provide the Russians with food aid, but we shall not assist a government which looks just like the old Russian Government. The fact is, Mr Putin looks just like all the members and chairmen of the KGB.</p>
<p class="contents">I wished to say this in the presence of Mr Armatov, the Chechen Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will have, as he listens to us, an idea of what democracy in Europe is.</p>

Russia is no exception in this, which is particularly painful for the European Left; it is acting as it sees fit and no differently from NATO in Yugoslavia. I consider the applause which you gave Mr Solana this morning and now the applause for the speech made by Mr Cohn-Bendit to be opportunism of the worst kind. I simply must say this!</p>
<p class="contents">To reverse the trend, that is away from the military and towards conflict prevention and peaceful conflict settlement, is the crucial challenge facing this European Parliament. We have logically assessed the war in Chechnya and we have also deferred our decision on further expansion of cooperation with Russia. We expect the same of the Council. Yesterday’s declaration by the Council is a positive sign but it is too late. It is to be hoped that the Council does not need as long to follow up our proposal to freeze the expansion of relations and the TACIS programmes for Russia until such time as the weapons finally fall silent.</p>
<p class="contents">The attacks on refugees and residential areas, the closing of the borders and the hindrance of international aid organisations providing humanitarian aid not only contravene the Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in war zones and other international obligations but are quite simply inhuman and totally unacceptable. I consider it self-evident and indispensable that the European Union increase its humanitarian aid for the people of this region. However, we must not release Russia from its responsibility to protect and provide for refugees and itself to care for the people in the war zone. The same also applies for the reconstruction of the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is used with excessive discretionary power, often owing to specific political or economic interests. The principle of humanitarian intervention has, until now, failed miserably because Milosevic’s regime is still firmly in power in a country that has gone backwards in time and economics by at least thirty years, while the majority of the Albanian people have returned to their land and 10% of Kosovar Serbs and all the gypsy peoples have been forced into exile. In Chechnya, the situation is even worse. Two months ago, the Russian army entered Chechnya, a land which had already been destroyed in human and economic terms and drained three years ago with more than 100,000 dead. Today, we hear of the civilian population being shelled, which has caused over 3,000 deaths and turned 200,000 people into refugees. And all of this while the so-called “virtuous” international community justifies the Russian intervention on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and the International Monetary Fund bankrolls unsecured funds to Yeltsin, despite the billions of dollars misappropriated by the Russian authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation, but the Russian troops do not have the authority to legally massacre men, women and children. The international community, our Union, is duty-bound, if it is truly committed to safeguarding human rights, not to remain passive. The region has been ravaged by war and, in the meantime, the European Union is increasing its commitment to humanitarian aid and funding for the TRASECA project to link the Black Sea and Central Asia. And the fuel factor – gas and oil – has played an important part in the Chechen crisis. American companies are interested in Caspian Sea oil as an alternative to Persian Gulf oil. They asked the Department of State to draw up a strategic map of possible routes: the most important would be the section between the Caspian Sea and the Turkish port of Ceyhan, which affects the route between Baku and the Russian port of Novorossisk. Thus, in 1994, the Russian army intervened to show that Russia controlled the operational oil pipelines allowing the Caspian Sea production to be exported so it would not risk being excluded from the power play dominated by America. </p>
<p class="contents">The Union must have one single objective: to contribute to re-establishing peace, to find a new status for Chechnya, as laid down in the agreement signed between Russia and Chechnya on 31 August 1996, and it must also remember that if Europe wants to defend human rights, it cannot continue to endorse the fact that Russia believes force and the army to be the only political tools.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And why does the Russian military apparatus provoke the Trans-Caucasian republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan by making wild accusations regarding cooperation with Chechen “separatists and terrorists”? </p>
<p class="contents">Both operations are pretty disastrous anyway, both for the Russian Federation and the Caucasus. Under the quasi-legitimate banner of “fighting terrorism and violent separatism”, the Kremlin is itself terrorising the Chechen people and is stimulating the very terrorist, fundamentalist elements amongst them. </p>
<p class="contents">It is likely that the Russian punitive expedition in Chechnya is largely founded on internal political and military motives other than the purging of “Chechen Wahabi headhunters”. To the fraudulent “family” of President Yeltsin, this is a true gift by way of a diversionary tactic. At the same time, the deeply aggrieved Russian army leadership can undertake bloody revenge for the humiliating defeat against the Chechen freedom fighters of only a few years ago. Moreover, the horrifying war scene in the Caucasus offers the average Russian politician the chance par excellence to beat the popular national drum, especially in the run-up to the Duma elections. </p>
<p class="contents">The trouble-stirring from Moscow in the Caucasus is undoubtedly the result of the competitive rivalry with the West regarding the energy treasures of the Caspian Basin and is indicative of a revival of the imperial idea. In this light, the Chechen tragedy is merely the overture for a larger, regional crisis. </p>

So long as greed for these possessions and for the resources in this area remains unconquered – and this applies equally to Europe and many other states – the conflicts in this region will not be resolved and, long term, we also have to consider finding a major, comprehensive solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two months ago we took up a clear position as a single international institution, albeit not every individual in the House. I am pleased that everyone has now come on board and that the Council and Commission also now support what we in this House clearly declared on this matter with a small majority two months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have now moved on considerably, having come to realise that it is not enough to direct threatening words at the Russians. Rather, we must reach conclusions. We must stop financing this war, which is a bloody, colonial war for oil and an especially bloody form of electoral campaigning. This means, Commissioner, that we must stop financial payments, including TACIS funds. On the other hand, we must clearly say to our partner that, as far as we are concerned, a partner is no longer a partner when he becomes a murderer. This should also be obvious between states.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to clear up a few myths. No mention is ever made of the democratically elected government of Chechnya. This is not another internal affair for Russia. This government was elected under the supervision of the OSCE on the basis of a cease-fire agreement which the OSCE brokered. We must resolutely support this government against the breach of this agreement by Moscow, which is a contravention of international law and which has come about as a result of the fact that Moscow has restored a KGB puppet parliament, which was in place in Moscow before the agreement, in order to have a comfortable negotiating partner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also clear up the myth that this is a response to terrorism. Mr Cohn-Bendit is right: we do not know who carried out the bomb attacks in Moscow, which we condemn. Much points to bogus machinations. We must state quite clearly that anyone dropping bombs on civilians is not fighting terrorists; rather he is inciting terrorists by traumatising whole generations which will suffer the consequences of this particularly brutal form of colonialism.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need a wholly clear and energetic policy and not the assertions of alibis which we have had in recent months, including from our governments. I would like to urge the Council and the Commission to use the same clear language at tomorrow’s OSCE Summit as the European Parliament has used in its resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overall picture which emerges is incredibly complicated. The Russians want to successfully conclude this military intervention using full force, whatever it costs. They deny that there are civilian fatalities. They say that the Chechen refugees, more than 300,000, are not facing a difficult situation. More and more, Russian politicians are using the Chechen conflict as an instrument of electoral campaign; and with some success. 95% of the Russian population support the war in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also true that Russia is claiming in principle that the entire Chechen population are terrorists and as a European Parliament we cannot and must not accept this. We therefore demand political dialogue and a political solution and commit ourselves to the means of pressure we have at our disposal, even the blocking of new TACIS projects or the refusal to provide food aid to Russia. Humanitarian aid yes, democratic projects yes, but nothing more! Even though we acknowledge that the debate and negotiations on Russian non-compliance with trade agreements and the steel agreement will then become extremely difficult for the European Union, terrorism cannot, and must not, be waged against an entire population using military might.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, an entirely different discussion, indeed an entirely different issue comes to the fore: The European Parliament has always made it clear in all its resolutions that Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation. I cannot quite understand therefore how an appointed Chechen Foreign Minister who, under international law, should not even exist, can hold an official discussion with the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I consider this to be an extremely difficult decision. I agree that the groups should have access to information, and I was very grateful that I was able to speak on this matter with Mr Achmadov, but in the past there have not been official appointments of this type in this House. This is a very unusual occurrence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that the Soviet Union of the time stirred up the processes of decolonisation, even when it was not always clear that the populations concerned actually wanted decolonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, then, we are facing an empire, the only one, which has saved on the expense of decolonisation. Historically, there is no doubt that the Russian Empire in fact colonised a large part of the Caucasus, i.e. non- Russian peoples. This is the first thing. I say this as a Federalist, and as somewhat not in favour of the multiplication of states.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second place, and I am addressing Mr Patten and the Council in particular, the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, have a policy in the Caucasus, the region which Chechnya is part of. It must, as a matter of urgency, have a policy which guarantees stability, not only for Chechnya, but also for Chechnya in relation to Georgia, in relation to Azerbaijan, in relation to Armenia. We know the problems there are particularly in this last country. It follows that a real European policy is urgently needed in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is strangely voiced at the extreme left of this Parliament. I personally think that this comparison is rather far-fetched, but it is useful to remind ourselves of the discrepancies. Our action and that of NATO in Kosovo and Serbia was undertaken with an extremely selective application of the least possible violence, sparing the civilian population as much as possible. Therein lies the huge difference between our action and the action Russia is taking in Chechnya at the moment. </p>
<p class="contents">It is useful that the extreme left should remind us of this difference, although quite unintended. Also, human life appears to be of no consequence and refugees are of no concern. Long lines of refugees are kept waiting at the border and international aid organisations fail to offer real help due to a lack of cooperation. This is another clear difference and it is really good that the extreme left have underscored these huge differences between Russia’s action in Chechnya and that of NATO in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is essential that clear-cut measures be taken and that we give the Russian population some sort of message. Indeed, we received the delegation from the Russian Parliament here and we noticed that there is, in fact, a common opinion amongst the Russian representatives there and they were not all from the same party. This stood out to us. </p>
<p class="contents">We will have therefore have to give the Russian population a message which is loud and clear so that they might start to question the events in Chechnya and their government’s action. I am sure we will need to bring some pressure to bear in Russia if we are to put an end to these Russian crimes once again. This is why I think, following on from what Mr Patten said during his hearing, that it is bad doing business with states which violate human rights on a massive scale – he was talking about China in response to a question raised by us – and that it is in fact beneficial to consider financial-economic measures when it comes to giving a clear message. We may be able to call on our friends from the Council of Europe too to consider a suspension. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think we as a Parliament should take a clear stance and express our support for the Chechen population and, for this reason, it is important to my mind that the President of the European Parliament meet the Chechen Foreign Minister in order to explain our stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to emphasise one area which can serve as a justification for our joint resolution on Chechnya: the suffering of the civilian population; the hundreds of fatalities; the 200,000 refugees and their plight given the onset of winter; the overreaction of the Russian government and the indiscriminate bombing of the civilian population. I have the impression that this is not a legitimate war against terrorist activity, but a political power struggle at the cost of the population.</p>

<p class="contents">For this reason our Parliament must clearly say what it wants and what it doesn’t want.

Secondly, we in no way wish to jeopardise the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, however, we cannot condone aeroplanes bombing the civilian population! I condemn these bombings, just as months ago I condemned the bombings of Novi Sad, Belgrade and Nis, which were described as “collateral damage”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are witnessing a destabilisation of the region which will have long-term consequences. Today, so I have heard, a Georgian village is reported to have been bombed by Russian planes. This means that there is a danger that this conflict will not remain a purely Russian conflict, but will perhaps extend beyond the Russian borders. This would then undoubtedly be a problem and a further matter for the world community and, of course, the European Union to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in recent plenary part-sessions since the summer, this Parliament has tackled the problem of the second Chechen war in great detail, as indeed it has had to. We have taken up a very clear position. We will also, by the mutual consent of all groups, take up a position in the resolution before us today. This is necessary and right!</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also share the view of Commissioner Patten that we must not in any way end communication with the Russians. If we want to persuade, if we want to exert influence, then this can only be done by intensifying discussions with our Russian partners. We were visited last week, as Mr Oostlander previously stated, by a Russian parliamentary delegation. I can only say, and this is the major problem with this second Chechen war, that contrary to the first Chechen war the Russian parties in the Duma are nearly all united and, unfortunately, support the policy of the Putin government. This makes it perfectly clear how important dialogue is and what we need to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the idea which was put forward here of possibly improving contact with the Russian Parliament through an ad-hoc delegation is an important one. And I also think that, since the Russians have asked us to act as electoral supervisors in the elections to the Duma, we must seriously consider whether to satisfy this request from the Parliament because this might be a further contribution to dialogue and to the development of more democracy and perhaps also better politics in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a much larger issue, and one we have to bear in mind.

The documents on the Caucasus and Chechnya contain the same elements found in the Council of Europe’s document that was dismissed two weeks ago. It therefore appears to be a mandatory exercise in rhetoric, with the usual array of fine principles and high hopes. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union expresses its concerns, stresses this and admonishes that, requests a dialogue that it knows is impossible and limits itself to condemning – and this is the first point I would like to talk about – just one thing: the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya. So you could say then, that a little bit of war is alright, as long as it is not disproportionate. But tell me, what is a disproportionate war? </p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the following: the bombing strategy following NATO’s example is supposedly a response to the terrorist bombs in various Russian cities. Is there any evidence, are there any suspicions that these bombs were planted by Chechens? What investigation confirms this? Is it reasonable to kill thousands of people and turn 200,000 people into refugees based on a mere suspicion of guilt?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is asking for a negotiated solution – and if anyone really believes in the possibility of negotiations they are living in cloud cuckoo land – while the Russians in the Caucasus are making a distinction between the bad guys – those who are asking for independence – perhaps making them out to be Muslims, and the good guys, or rather only those people who are collaborating with them.
