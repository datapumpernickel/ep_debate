Although the WTO accession process of Russia was long, the results are impressive. Our exporters will now find it easier to access Russian markets. Reductions in customs duties will mean savings of EUR 2.5 billion a year. Our services industries will also have easier access – particularly in finance, telecommunications and retail. Moving goods across the border will be eased with the new rules on customs valuation, fees and transit procedures. Russian export duties on many raw materials have been capped and will be reduced for key inputs like wood, and we will have a more predictable regulatory environment for our investment in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Russia has taken a number of protectionist measures that cause great concern – both in terms of Russia’s willingness to play by the rules of the WTO and of their significant negative impact on the EU economy. For example, Russia’s decision on levying so-called ‘recycling fees’ on imported vehicles is problematic, because it discriminates against European producers and infringes the most basic WTO rules, and duties on cars are now higher than before Russia’s WTO accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s ban on live pig imports is a clear case of a regulatory measure acting as a tool of trade protection, lacking any valid scientific basis, and is disproportionate to the issues it seeks to address.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified a list of more than 300 products with discrepancies between the applied import duties and the agreed tariffs in the WTO, and in most cases giving least-favourable treatment to EU exporters in sectors like paper, agriculture, automotive products and textiles. Lastly, the preferential export duties for our wood imports from Russia agreed upon prior to WTO accession are still not in place. We will start by trying to find agreed solutions, failing which we will not hesitate to enforce our WTO rights if they are violated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes note of the European Parliament’s Policy Study on Russia’s WTO accession, which correctly concludes that membership of the WTO is only a starting point for the sustained and diversified growth of the Russian economy. What is needed is a thorough reform of the domestic economy and business environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Only Russia can choose to pursue such a reform, but the EU is willing to help through a new framework agreement. In this context, the European Commission is not asking for new market access commitments. However, there is scope to break new ground on a range of regulatory issues, and Europe has one of the world’s most advanced regulatory regimes and useful experience to share.</p>
<p class="contents">This agenda is complicated by the creation of a customs union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The European Commission’s priority remains to develop our bilateral trade relations with Russia first, as it is the only WTO member among these three countries, and the political situation in Belarus remains a serious matter of concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However – as the Commissioner has just said – the trading relations are certainly not the best. The reason for this is that up to now Russia has only operated in accordance with its own rules and that is often a source of very great frustration for the European business community. I have today seen in the business ranking published by the World Bank that Russia is only in 112th place. That is because it is very difficult to do business with Russia. That is the very reason that the accession of Russia to the WTO is a very good development that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) also welcome and set down in a resolution accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Madam President, we must check whether all the agreements made are observed. Allow me to make a couple of comments in that regard. If we wish to use the potential of economic relations with Russia to the full then we must also ensure that Russia complies with all its obligations in the framework of the WTO. In the run-up to the accession there are still very many things that give me cause for concern, such as protectionist measures, unilateral, temporary tariff increases, and the production and sale of counterfeit goods. These aspects have now been named and we must keep an eye on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Accession to the WTO is an unbelievably important step but there are other specific issues that the EU and Russia must settle at bilateral level. These matters will soon be dealt with in the Swoboda report in which, as today, we must ask for attention to be paid by the departments concerned to ensuring that the negotiations, also regarding a partnership agreement, will again run smoothly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia has undertaken to align its trade rules and practices with WTO standards, in particular with regard to non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies and improving intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Russia’s efforts in this direction are substantial, and that the implementation of these commitments as swiftly as possible will facilitate trade with WTO member states, encourage the creation of new jobs and contribute to an increase in Russia’s GDP. At the same time, the decision to join an international trade organisation means not only benefits, but also compliance with rules established by mutual agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, arbitrary measures such as banning imports of animals originating from the European Union must be avoided in future. It must also be borne in mind that the negotiations on a new agreement between the European Union and Russia will gravitate towards the WTO obligations assumed by both parties, and are a good opportunity to lay down common principles and objectives in the area of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I support the inclusion in the new agreement of a substantial and legally binding chapter on energy in order to create a transparent and non-discriminatory energy market, and a chapter on sustainable development through which we encourage Russia to respect both human and workers’ rights and also international environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Not least, the Member States should draw up a list of common interests so that they will be approached in a concerted manner during future negotiations with the Russian Federation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was high time indeed. I think it is good news for Russia but also for the European Union. Why? Because we can hope for a relationship based on clear rules and clear applicability. If we look at what happened to China after it joined the WTO, we can see that the growth and the success story of China really began with that date a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope this will happen for Russia as well and that Russia can also envisage an extreme success story after the significant date in August this year. But I would also like to raise two concerns, two challenges. One has already been mentioned by Mr Sefčovič and other colleagues, and that is that Russia does not seem to be willing to live up 100 % to its obligations which come with the accession to the WTO but is instead undertaking some extensive and potentially restrictive trade measures like the examples which have already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make is that we have to look at the business environment in Russia. Russia has always been a very proud nation with a rich culture, with inventions and <span class="italic">esprit</span>; Nobel Prize winners and astronauts have come from Russia. We all know about these important landmarks in Russian history. But why is it that today – apart from maybe vodka, caviar and Gazprom – we do not really know of any Russian brands? Why is it that they do not really thrive? Why are there not Russian success stories? I think this has to do with the applicability of the rule of law and human rights, and I think it is good that it has been raised in our resolution. It comes in a timely manner, because next week we go to Moscow and can discuss it there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we believe that proper time must be given to Russia to implement the WTO requirements before we start talking about further bilateral negotiations on a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that there is reason to remain vigilant on the Eurasian Customs Union, but we cannot automatically assume it is incompatible with Russia’s WTO obligations. Our group filed a number of amendments for which I would like to ask your support. In particular we would like to rethink the wisdom of paragraph 11, last indent, regarding pre-establishment investment protection and to request support for our Amendment 8. Russia has for a long time been the only country with a reasonably well-developed information and communications infrastructure that has not been subject to the TRIPS agreement requirements. This has led to interesting developments in the field of content distribution in Russia, not only in illegal downloading – a topic which we discuss with far too much aggression too frequently in our House – but also in distribution schemes that are, or were at the time of their emergence, legal under the Russian system.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time the Russian authorities appeared to have no regard for freedom of communication or freedom of information flows. At least once during my time of political involvement, Russian authorities have casually shut down legal online distribution services at the request of foreign entities to accommodate the advancement of World Trade Organisation discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a shame if the TRIPS implementation chosen by Russia turned out to hinder rather than foster the previously-mentioned spirit of solutions for online distribution for the future. And there is good reason for the European Union to keep a close watch on the implementation of the TRIPS obligations in Russia. They establish a basis for economic interaction which depends completely on an administrative right, a monopoly granted by the government and its legal institutions to private parties. Are we confident that the Russian administration is consistent enough to provide such a basis?</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of copyright in particular, the TRIPS agreement and the present interpretation adopted by the disputes settlement body of the Berne three-step test should cause us to feel concern for how future implementation of Russian copyright will relate to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Already at European level we are suffering from inconsistencies with the application of notice and take-down orders.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President requested the speaker to speak more slowly)</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the concerns raised in the European Union by many stakeholders is that notice and take-down requests risk imposing arbitrary restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of expression in the Member States. Similar objections have been raised in Spain and France in the implementation of laws that grant rightholders the power to request the take-down of a web page through administrative requests rather than judicial process.</p>
<p class="contents">The TRIPS agreement does not establish any boundaries for enforcement. In theory it can be extended as far and as arbitrarily as a signatory party wants it to be extended. Therefore we have to ask ourselves whether or not the situation in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of expression will be affected by the implementation of TRIPS in Russia. Given our experiences in Europe, we need to keep a close eye on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have the opportunity to revisit the question of the monitoring of communications. The situation in many European jurisdictions with the Data Retention Directive and in terms of intermediary liability for intellectual property rights infringements is uncertain. Also in Russia there are extensive obligations on telecommunications providers and service providers to monitor the communications of their users. We have every reason to be vigilant so that the situation in Russia does not deteriorate with respect to the monitoring of communications.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of access control and allegedly illegal content on line, the issue of blocking access to specific content has already been debated many times and by many people in the Member States and here in Parliament, but these proposals also exist in Russia, again with the higher risk of arbitrary application and again with a broader scope than we would normally find in Europe. If the European Union wishes to see the implementation of human rights, freedom of speech, free journalism and a free press in Russia, it will be important for us to establish – firstly for ourselves – open norms for free communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that Russia’s entry into the World Trade Organisation will put this situation right and make the country more business-friendly because, to put it simply, Russians deserve this. Commissioner Šefčovič spoke of this protectionalism, or protectionism, which we fear.

<p class="contents">I would like to respond to the report by Mr Sturdy, since he examines the status of the relationship with the Russian Federation from economic perspectives, taking Russia’s accession to the WTO, after years of negotiation, as the reference point. I am grateful to the permanent rapporteur for trade negotiations with the Russian Federation for not allowing himself to ignore troubling news about social conflicts, increasingly arbitrary behaviour by the authorities and new, ambivalent legal situation in Russia, but for sticking soberly to the facts. </p>
<p class="contents">There are policy areas that cannot just be subsumed under the logic and dynamism of foreign policy. We have talked about this here several times before. Parliament should also form policy with a view to economic cooperation and create trade relations independently of political trends. I welcome the fact that the Commission representatives here in Parliament recently made a commitment to guarantee the stability of this relationship and, as a consequence, to take the Russian leadership at its word regarding the modernisation of the country and its interest in having the EU at its side as a partner.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major lessons of the earlier conflicts in Europe is that rapprochement brings change. Mutual rapprochement works in the 21st century but only on an equal footing and through joint efforts. Trade is not an instrument for this rapprochement but does have exactly this effect. This change, which, along with further economic cooperation, we feel is justified, should have as its aim a movement towards greater social justice, less poverty, greater democracy, obviously greater rule of law and thus respect for human rights. We know that the rule of law without democracy – or vice versa – does not work. However, greater democracy without greater social justice, greater application of trade union rights, international labour norms, environmental standards, etc. is even worse. This also applies to the serious consideration of the impacts of the Russian Federation’s accession to the WTO, which in the medium term are not easy to predict, on jobs in industry, the service sector and elsewhere. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should also take a fresh look at trade barriers. What is really preventing trade with Russia at present is not only trade barriers as we define them but also the continued existence of the visa requirement. The statements at the EU-Russia summit in this regard read well but have not added anything of substance yet. We ought to change this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we should perceive this change as a good momentum to intensify dialogue on several issues that we have so far failed to resolve satisfactorily in bilateral negotiations. For example, we may expect that, when complying with WTO trade rules, Russia may proceed to restrict export duties and reduce import duties, and will also provide better access to service providers from abroad to the Russian market and simplify procedures in bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The greater openness of Russia’s vast market space for our producers in the engineering, automotive, consumer, textile, pharmaceutical and food industries can only help to reinvigorate our still sluggish economy. Therefore, we should not hesitate too long with our initiatives because the Americans, the Chinese and the Japanese are certainly interested in using the new more favourable conditions for mutually beneficial business cooperation with Russia and they will seek to find more stable moorings for their companies in the large Russian market. There is an opportunity here to improve business collaboration and it is up to us how effectively we are able to make use of this today for the development of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia is continuing to implement measures that are restrictive of trade. Here we should mention, for example, the ban on importing animals from the European Union, a legislative measure that discriminates against foreign nationals in the sphere of public procurement, a seasonal import duty on sugar, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia must take urgent measures in the sphere of intellectual property protection. It is still continuing to both produce and sell counterfeit products. Not enough work is being done to combat corruption. Significant reforms are still needed. It is very important to stress that Russia has practically suspended work on the new partnership and cooperation agreement. This agreement is extremely important: it must be detailed and legally binding, and must include European requirements on standards; it must establish a legally binding energy section, consolidating a non-discriminatory and transparent energy market. In view of the fact that approximately 75 % of investment in Russia comes directly from the European Union, it is important to ensure that our investors are protected, by holding talks on a bilateral investment agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nine years have now passed since Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest and the start of the Yukos trial. The fact that this case is ongoing shows that in Russia the rule of law can for the moment only be seen as a goal, but we must do everything possible to achieve this goal. Finally, I would like to stress that treaties and agreements must be adhered to. Our task is to ensure that our partner, Russia, does so. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is just two years since Russia agreed on a partnership for modernisation with the EU for the same reasons; the declared aims of this partnership include the alignment of technical standards, the extension of investment opportunities in key sectors for innovation and growth and the general strengthening of trade relations – all these are improved by WTO accession.</p>
<p class="contents">However, successful accession to the WTO may perhaps merely give Russia more of a voice in other international bodies. Russia will only benefit from membership of it actually implements the joint agreement on trade facilitation. A partnership with the EU for modernisation only makes sense if Russia complies with its WTO obligations. Cherry picking, WTO à la carte – there are so many pleasing expressions for what we can to some extent still see Russia doing, what Russia is doing with its membership at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU advocated for a long time that Russia should at last be a member of the World Trade Organisation and we will prove a reliable partner to our Russian friends in the future, but this relationship cannot function in one direction only. Even the joint project, which has already taken so long, i.e. the joint partnership agreement, can now be facilitated through the WTO accession on either side, since the rules no longer have to be negotiated – they are established. However – there are two conditions: the Russians must really comply, and the EU cannot pile on more conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a member of the delegation to the EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, I would like to add something else that has not yet been mentioned in this debate, namely that Russia has made an effort to redraft its position both with respect to the WTO, and therefore the international community and particularly the Western nations and, through the Customs Union, with respect to the Eurasian countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need to think carefully about the compatibility of the WTO and Russia’s accession to it, the new bilateral agreement being negotiated with Russia by the EU, and the Customs Union. I think this is one of the most complicated aspects. We do not yet know how the Customs Union will evolve, or whether as expected it will lead to a common economic area based on the four freedoms of movement that exist in the EU, but I believe that we should be taking an integrated approach to Russia on the one hand and Central Asia on the other. There is no point in creating antagonism between these two areas, bearing in mind the umbilical cord that links Russia with Central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we need to try to ensure that the Customs Union’s standards as regards safety and anti-trust rules are still in line with European standards, and I am also wondering what good the abolition of the visa system will do in these negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the issue, though, is about whether Russia successfully adopts WTO procedures. What does joining the WTO actually mean in practice? The official commitments include non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, reducing tariffs and binding tariff levels, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights and foregoing the use of local content requirements and other investment measures which limit imports. It also requires them to open government procurement contract opportunities to foreign firms and to accept that the WTO will settle trade dispute procedures. That is quite a long list for Russia to sign up to.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite a challenge for Russia. For example, Russia has export duties on no less than 450 types of products at the moment, and duties will be reduced from 19 % to an average of 8 %. Russia is still a tough place to do business. It is ranked 120 in the world ‘ease of doing business’ rankings, and Putin called the accession process to the WTO an ambush of Russian economic interests. So I very much welcome the move towards the WTO, but there are some tough challenges ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This approach is in many ways forthcoming, and in this case welcomes Russia’s accession to the WTO. As usual, however, the suggested resolution lists the homework for others, i.e. for Russia, and says very little of what we are going to do to improve relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the resolution in its current form means that once again we will miss the opportunity to state that we consider the earliest possible lifting of visa requirements between Russia and the European Union to be important for an improvement in trade and political relations. Abstract references to ongoing negotiations are insufficient. For me, the European Parliament’s own initiative is missing, and I fear that there is also a lack of understanding of the significance of this intention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it is unclear to me why it states in paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution that the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus Customs Union should impose additional barriers to trade with Russia. It is obvious that such a barrier would be inconsistent with WTO rules and Russia’s newly adopted commitments. However, we can also say that the said Customs Union will remove barriers and will extend the WTO rules to other areas. I cannot help but feel that the aforementioned expression of concern is an expression of political resistance to the ongoing integration process in the post-Soviet space, rather than an expression of interest in the implementation of the WTO objectives.</p>

The EU has consistently supported Russia’s membership of the WTO and its explanations that it would commit its authorities to obey the rules of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the past ten months have not been particularly encouraging. Therefore I think it is important to formulate a clear and comprehensive EU position to indicate that this time we expect Moscow to live up to its commitments. We should not waste any time in doing this. Let us be under no illusions. The pattern in Russia has thus far been a selective one, mostly insisting on exceptions when it is in Russia’s particular interests. The Energy Charter Treaty has been a notorious example.</p>

<p class="contents">I have two suggestions for the Commission. The EU clearly has to indicate that full compliance with the WTO rules will be a precondition for continuing negotiations for a new EU-Russia trade treaty. Secondly, the Commission should use EU technologies, standards and conformity assessment procedures in forthcoming negotiations, insisting that our counterparts accommodate themselves to EU rules, which are anyway in harmony with the WTO rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should increase Russian GDP growth, accelerate the joint EU-Russia modernisation programme, assist the creation and retention of jobs both in Russia and in the EU Member States, and allow implementation of higher environmental protection standards. The accession has removed an important barrier in negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia. However, Russia must coherently implement its assumed obligations, further liberalise its trade regime and create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and foreign investment. WTO membership prohibits the worsening of trade conditions based on political motives or the interests of lobby groups. It is important that when the Russian Government reduces import tariffs, it does not artificially raise other taxes or introduce new ones. EU-Russia cooperation following Russia’s accession to the WTO must also encourage neighbouring Belarus to integrate further with world trade.

We hoped that having the same rules would help boost economic relations with Russia and automatically resolve the issue of the current trade barriers. It seemed to be a step forward in our relationship, the economic significance of which cannot be underestimated. The EU continues to be Russia’s main trading partner and also the biggest foreign investor in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">However, looked at today, Russian accession has sadly not lived up to our expectations. Moreover, it seems that Russia has been increasing the number of protectionist measures and ignoring WTO rules and regulations. On 20 March this year, Russia decided to ban all imports of live animals from the EU, saying that the spread of the Schmallenberg virus made these imports too risky. This reason was immediately declared to be ‘disproportionate and not based on scientific evidence’. What is more, many live animals such as pigs are not affected by the virus at all. The real reason for such behaviour from the Russian side is the wish to implement protectionist measures because, starting from Russia’s accession to the WTO, the import duties for live pigs had to decrease from 40 % to 5 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite letters and consultations at the highest level, Russia has not agreed to lift the ban. This is an extremely important issue for Estonia, from where nearly 60 % of live pigs used to be exported to Russia. Therefore, before moving ahead with trade relations, the current restrictions and clear violations of WTO rules need to be solved as fast as possible. There is also a need to come up with measures to influence the Russian side to implement and respect the common WTO rules and not to take WTO as being <span class="italic">à la carte</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU is the largest foreign investor in Russia, so the creation of effective mechanisms of mutual trade policy is essential to protect the interests of European business people.

What they say – and they have begun using this argument – is that the Energy Package is in breach of World Trade Organisation principles, and that it inhibits free trade. This is nonsense, as many expert appraisals have asserted – the third energy package is compliant with international law. It assigns the same rights and duties to European companies and to Russian companies. Gazprom benefits from the provisions of this third energy package, even though it is criticising it. The monopolist has increased its commercial activities in the EU and has purchased a number of European energy companies. It also derives benefits from WTO rules. Meanwhile, European businesses cannot count on equal treatment in Russia, a point that has been raised in our discussions. Because of corruption and a lack of rule-of-law governments in Russia, some of these businesses have been thrown out of Russia. BP is an example. Russia also frequently fails to observe WTO rules relating to equal treatment of operators.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that at this time when we are negotiating a new understanding on partnership and cooperation we must attribute a great deal of weight to this and treat the fulfilment of Article 102, which Russia is accused of breaching, as an essential condition for the signing of a new partnership agreement. The EU must deploy all of its potential, along with the potential it has through the WTO, to oblige Moscow to act in accordance with the law. The same is also true of the antimonopoly accusation and the investigation which the European Union is conducting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Šefčovič that we have shown pragmatism with regard to trade, but there are further problems. One should take into account that in Latvia there are two border control points – Grebneva and Terehova – where the problem of crossing the EU border has not yet been solved and thousands of EU cars are stuck waiting day and night for the possibility to cross the border.</p>
<p class="contents">The Latvian Government cannot solve this problem without the help of the European Commission, meaning that representatives of all European countries are involved. It is necessary to quickly conduct negotiations with the representatives of Russia and to swiftly find a solution to this problem. I am prepared to visit, together with the representatives of the European Commission, the border control points at Terehova and Grebneva to study the situation on the spot.

It is good news for Russia and it is good news for the European Union, and I believe it is good news for Russia’s neighbours, for countries that are not in the European Union but are in the Eastern Partnership, for those countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union and now just want to enjoy normal relations with the Russian Federation, both political and commercial.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth devoting some attention to at least some of those countries. The first question that arises is that of Georgia. After the 2008 conflict, Georgia, following very strained relations, voiced many expressions of good will. The Georgian President abolished visas for Russian citizens and opened up the Georgian market to goods from Russia. I think it is high time for us to say that we – we, that is, meaning international society, we, the European Union, we, the European Parliament – expect Russia to take a similar stance where Russo-Georgian trade relations are concerned. Now, and particularly with Russia being a WTO member, there is no further justification for a ban on the importation of food products from Georgia into the Russian market. We must make it clear to our partners in Russia that this is what we expect. My expectation of the European Commission representatives is that they will strongly emphasise in talks with Russia that these WTO rules apply to all parties, and they also apply to Russia in its relations with its neighbours such as Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova. I hope that these relations will be built on the foundation of WTO principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a symbol of the efficacy of our policy where Russia is concerned. Let us recall that it was predicated on the concept of an economic opening-up of the European Union to Russia, closer relations and allowing Russian investment in the European Union, especially where the energy sector that is so very important to the Russian budget is concerned. In exchange, we were supposed to bring about the modernisation of Russia and its democratisation. Let us draw up a balance sheet for this period. Russia today is a more authoritarian country than it was when it began negotiating with the WTO over membership. Russia today is a country that is far more dependent on raw materials exports, chiefly energy-related, than it was 10 to 15 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy brought about a fiasco and ended in failure. This is the time when we should be telling ourselves this clearly. It is good that Russia has entered the WTO, but now Russia is looking to a new agreement on cooperation and partnership with the European Union for further concessions from the EU which would cover the costs of accession to the World Trade Organisation. This demonstrates the attitude of the Russian authorities, who are genuinely expecting all the rest to adapt themselves to the drastic standards by which the Russian Federation is governed, rather than see Russia adapt to the standards of relations with the European Union or WTO membership. We must not forget this. We have many common interests, in the pursuit of which we need to cooperate, but where our interests clash, we must draw conclusions from this and be more assertive where the Russians are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Yukos case, in which Khodorkovsky’s oil company was essentially confiscated by the Russian Government, continues to cast a shadow over Russia’s efforts to reassure its new partners in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Yukos case is one of many examples of Russia’s political use of justice, and that is why Russia still needs to show that it can be trusted as a commercial partner. Since Khodorkovsky’s arrest in 2003, there have been many other signs of Russia’s selective approach to the rule of law, especially in the commercial field. Russia is also prone to using its gas resources as a diplomatic weapon, and a current EU price-fixing inquiry aimed at Gazprom suggests that the Kremlin will continue to put its own interests above its international obligations. So, Russia is an important commercial partner for the EU, but it remains potentially unreliable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that progress may be slow and that we may have to settle for the Macmillan maxim of two steps forward, one step backward.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, having the international standards of the WTO to deal with any disputes, etc. can only lead to progress.

We had – and we still have – positive expectations as to how this membership will be beneficial to our mutual relationship. But we also have to record a certain disappointment with the application of WTO rules in Russia. I also noted a very clear call from the honourable Members of this Parliament to the Commission to look for constructive solutions and to make sure that Russia respects WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important in the negotiations with our Russian partners to highlight the positive benefits that the WTO agreement brings to both sides. In my introductory remarks I referred to the expected EUR 2.5 billion in savings for European exporters to Russia thanks to the decrease of import duties. I can also say that EUR 3.9 billion of additional EU exports is expected per year. In terms of the benefits this will bring to the Russian side, I would claim that they will be of a similar order.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly a win-win solution, and it could be a real success story for both Russia and the European Union if the rules are respected and correctly applied. This was mentioned by several speakers, including Mrs Koch-Mehrin, Mr Scholz and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Andersdotter, I would like to underline the fact that Russia needs to apply the WTO rules regarding TRIPS - intellectual property rights - from the date of accession. The Commission is, of course, obliged to monitor how compliance with these rules is ensured by the Russian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a discussion, and several comments, concerning the new agreement. It is supposed to be a wide agreement covering all areas of the very far-ranging relationship between the European Union and Russia. I believe that if we succeed in negotiating and agreeing the new agreement, it will help us tackle the problems which were raised by Mrs Vaidere, especially veterinary restrictions, procurement and breach of intellectual property rights. So we think that it is very important to negotiate and to work on this new agreement. What would be the most useful in this respect would be to pursue our bilateral path.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that a positive outcome of the negotiations on the new agreement would be helpful – and indeed crucial – for Russia, because respect for WTO rules, a good agreement, and compliance with this agreement on both the Russian and European sides are key to the integration of Russia into the global rules-based system, which I believe would benefit both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Several questions were raised about what we would like to see in the new agreement. It is quite clear that we regard it as important, in addition to the usual traditional components of such an agreement, to have very clear and solid articles on trade, investment and energy provisions, because without those key components we would not be able to conclude the agreement. We want to have an all-encompassing document which will provide a real framework for our bilateral relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In all the remarks, it was quite clear that honourable Members feel a certain disappointment about the way in which the WTO rules are respected by Russia. There have been clear calls for the Commission to act and look for ways to remedy the current problems and the current situation. I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: we will start by trying to find agreed solutions to this problem, but, failing that, we will not hesitate to enforce our rights under the WTO when they are violated. These are our rights. We have a system whereby the WTO sets the rules for all the Members and, if the rules are breached, the remedy should be sought and applied. It is quite clear that this is something that the European Union will have to do if these infringements of the rules persist.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Mirsky, who commented on the situation and the restrictions on border crossing, I would just like to assure him that the Commission is aware of the situation and that this problem will be raised in discussions with our Russian partners. Regarding the last comment, on the situation in Georgia, which was raised by Mr Lisek, I would just like to underline that Georgia is also a member of the WTO and can use the WTO system to raise this issue and to address the ban with the World Trade Organisation, but, as far as we know, so far it has chosen not to.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to thank honourable Members for a very good debate. I appreciate the support for the overall thrust of the Commission’s policy towards Russia. Together with many honourable Members, I would like to express the hope that, through constructive dialogue with our Russian partners, we will be able to achieve greater compliance with WTO rules. This would clearly be to the benefit of trade and the overall relationship between the European Union and Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The winner in this trade is not state protectionism, but competitiveness, as the motor for the global progress of civilisation. It does, however, throw up global challenges: delocalisation of capital, local structural unemployment, and even crises, like the one we are currently experiencing in Europe. Russia is a big economic player on a global scale, which, like China, may exert an influence on the European debt crisis, which is a consequence of free, but unbalanced, trade. This means there is an urgent need for global mechanisms to bring equilibrium to the trade balance. As a WTO member, Russia will become a more predictable partner for the EU, which will reduce the risk of trading with that country and enable the trade deficit of some EU countries to be limited. Russia is a large supplier of mineral raw materials, including gas and oil, and of natural raw materials – cereals and timber. At the same time it is a vast sales market for investment and consumer goods. The accession of Russia to the WTO will without doubt benefit both parties: the EU and Russia. As is usual in such instances, during the transition period this may be accompanied by phenomena such as a rise in unemployment in this country and migration flows, and even by dumping practices. We must also bear in mind that Russia also forms part of an independent customs union with three states that are not WTO members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be a mistake to simplify the relationship between these two powers to an exchange ‘of energy for manufactured goods’. The EU and Russia have many other mutual interests rooted in their common history and cultures. After all, we share the same land and are neighbours. I would like to believe that Russia’s accession to WTO proved that Russia had abandoned the former ‘block thinking’ and is making significant steps towards being part of a multipolar modern world. How unfortunate that Russophobic sentiments mean that many Western countries are still stuck in the days of October 1962. The EU tends to lecture Russia on human rights, often linking the issues to the former Soviet communist era. One has to wonder with a smile why the still-communist-China is a much larger trading partner of the EU than Russia. Many economists, who have been so wrong so many times before, believe that the EU’s economic gains from Russia’s accession to the WTO will be modest. Perhaps, but we should let the future show. Meanwhile, let us, the European Union, welcome Russia into the WTO family and understand this step as Russia’s political demonstration of the will to be our partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we note that in the run-up to the completion of its WTO accession Russia has not been fully living up to its future WTO obligations, and call on Russia to remove barriers to open and fair trade, which do damage to EU exporters. The opening of Russia’s economy to more international trade and investment should serve as an incentive for the Russian Government to pursue reforms fighting corruption, implementing the rule of law and enhancing the business climate. In this context, remembering that today is the ninth anniversary of the arrest of former head of Yukos Mikhail Hodorkovsky – a clear example of the business climate remaining unfavourable in Russia – I join my colleagues in demanding an independent and impartial investigation into the Yukos case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
