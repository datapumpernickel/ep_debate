<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gemelli (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Chairman of the Committee on Petitions.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentleman, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for all her input in the Committee on Petitions and the great understanding that she showed in dealing with all the Members and with me personally, in her work in the Committee on Petitions. She has now chosen to take the office of minister in the Asturias regional government, and we congratulate her on this appointment and wish her every success in the work that I am sure she will carry out with her usual sensitivity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio, and to the Commission as a whole, for relations between European Commission officials and the Committee on Petitions have gradually been normalised and regularised, with the members of the Committee on Petitions becoming increasingly involved in Commission issues and with the officials working on the issues raised by the public ceasing to use bureaucratic language.</p>
<p class="contents">This is testimony to the growth of the institution of petitions, the increase in citizens’ awareness in approaching this body to make their problems known, in other words in the increase in awareness of European citizenship and of the European dimension that is gradually filtering through to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics and data provided by Mrs González Álvarez show that the number of petitions, and the number of people signing them, has increased dramatically. This growth in the number of petitions and in the number of signatories shows the extent to which this House and the European Institutions are providing increasing guarantees where citizens’ problems are concerned. The citizen is dwarfed by the gargantuan nature of the institutions and of globalisation. I believe that we certainly need to make the right to petition a reality and to make proper use of the institution of the Ombudsman and anything else that can help to increase the stature of the citizens in the face of the huge undertakings of the present and the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also carried out a mission in Italy – the country currently holding the Council Presidency – calling for strengthening of this body, not least as part of the overall programme of the European Presidency. We met the minister, Mr Buttiglione, the deputy-ministers, Mr Caldoro and Mr Nucara, and the vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies,<span class="bold"> </span>Mr Fiori, but, most importantly, we met with the four presidents of the bodies which, to some extent, take the place of a national ombudsman, that is Professor Rasi for privacy, Professor Ranci for energy, Professor Tesauro for competition and Professor Cheli for communications. We asked them to focus on the fate of the citizens in their areas of competence rather than resolving conflicts between companies and between institutions. Indeed, very often, these institutions are distracted by the need to resolve conflicts between powers. We, on the other hand, have an issue to resolve that is greater than conflict between powers: ensuring that these institutions are genuinely representative of the citizens. There must, therefore, be continual checks to monitor the adherence of the institutions to the mandate conferred on them by the citizens, and this will only be possible if we succeed in strengthening the role of these bodies designed to protect the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add very briefly that, as the Committee on Petitions, we need to create an organic system within Parliament for consultation with other Committees, and this will probably be achieved by means of an internal parliamentary regulation. Furthermore, there should never be any conflicts of competences; rather, we must work together and cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards own-initiative reports, I would like to say briefly that perhaps we should amend the Rules of Procedure in this regard too, for the own-initiative reports decided by the Conference of Presidents should certainly reach plenary, having already been processed at Committee level with the appointment of rapporteurs, the drafting of the report, and so forth, and they must not be blocked by any organ. If there has to be a filter, I believe that this should be applied as early as when the proposal to draft such a report is being considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point relates to the restructuring of the Committee on Petitions. I am not in favour of nominalism. If the Committee on Petitions is not to remain as it is but is to perform other tasks, then it is absolutely necessary to provide for a restructuring of its secretariat; otherwise, this will not be possible. If the secretariat is to remain, with the same structure, then the Committee on Petitions cannot deal with anything else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from examining the many petitions it received, your committee had to deal with the election of the new Community Ombudsman. It successfully performed its duties in that regard, organising hearings of the candidates with meticulous efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a series of own-initiative reports were produced on points of principle, such as the Perry-Kessler report on the right of petition at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Mr Gemelli’s report on strengthening the right of petition with a view to a revision of the EC Treaty, and Mr de Rossa’s report, which contained your committee’s contribution to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I want to repeat once again that the Commission is particularly aware of the importance of petitions as a yardstick for the day-to-day concerns of the citizens of Europe. From this point of view, the Committee on Petitions is irreplaceable, being the ideal forum for establishing direct relationships between citizens and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement, moreover, will lead to the committee becoming a privileged yardstick for the progress of European integration. What I am talking about is the committee’s desire to enhance its own administrative capacity, in order to process the expected influx of a large number of new petitions from citizens of the Member States as effectively as possible. In this connection, I can only acknowledge and express my support for what Mr Gemelli has just said.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission is prepared to improve its own procedures. As it has stated on various occasions, moreover, it is prepared to discuss with Parliament and the Council the possibility of reviewing the 1989 exchange of letters procedure, on processing petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs González Álvarez, who will not be taking part in today’s debate, for her work. I wish her luck and every possible success in her new duties. I want to recognise the role played by the new petitions in providing information on services linked to the implementation of Community law. Furthermore, we will do everything we can to coordinate the actions of the Commission’s services with the Committee on Petitions in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Gemelli for his acknowledgement that the responses of the Commission as a whole, and of its staff in particular, have improved noticeably in recent years. I thank him on behalf of all the staff of the Commission, who do a wonderful job. I believe it is only right to pass Mr Gemelli’s message on to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel I should mention the web of strong working relationships we have built up between the Commission, the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the role played by the Committee on Petitions must become more widely known amongst the citizens. We in the Commission, therefore, will continue to support the committee’s efforts, and I hope that we will feel as happy with the progress made in future as with the progress we are making now. We are making progress, and we are moving towards the scenario Mr Gemelli described: an increasingly complex, globalised world, in which the citizen does not diminish in stature, but rather grows in self-respect, in accomplishments and as a human being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not really present any new difficulties. This is because essentially what it does is to provide an overview of the activity of this committee and confirm its role. Nonetheless, I did table amendments on behalf of the PPE Group. These amendments were adopted, thus introducing a number of improvements. The latter related to improvement of working methods and focused in particular on raising awareness of the work of the committee. A greater effort to provide a swifter response to petitions received is also called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs González Álvarez’s report emphasises that by its very nature, the Committee on Petitions acts as a link between Parliament and the citizens of Europe. This committee is becoming increasingly important due to its close ties with the citizens. As enlargement approaches, the committee’s work should continue. It must be intensified and strengthened. In addition, the committee’s efficiency needs to be above reproach.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it is essential to ensure that the Committee on Petitions becomes more widely known. paragraph 23 does in fact state that with a view to the accession of new Member States to the EU, Parliament calls for firmer measures to ensure that the new European citizens are aware of their right to petition Parliament, the Commission and the Ombudsman under Articles 21 and 194 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, our committee should improve its brand image with the citizens as the Union faces up to significant challenges. Over and above presenting the current state of affairs, the main aim of this report is to assist the Committee on Petitions to develop as appropriate and meet its objective to be the practical tool enabling citizenship of an enlarged Europe to be exercised and actually bring Europe closer to the citizens, in a practical way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We already miss her here in Parliament. I also wish to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Petitions for its hard and successful work. With few increased resources, much more work has been done, and we have had quite a high profile.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it has been a successful year. Since our last debate, Mr Perry’s report has become topical. We have the Earl of Stockton’s report on the Reverend Owen and Mrs Fourtou’s report, which has produced results concerning silicone breast implants. We shall also debate bush meat and multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, we are getting no further when it comes to the Spanish water plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We are nonetheless all agreed that, before enlargement, we must make progress in dealing with petitions, especially at the beginning of the work, and grasp the hand of cooperation extended by the Ombudsman about a year ago. I believe this to be important, especially before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that worries me are the cases when complaints to the Commission, on the basis of Article 226, and petitions to the Committee concern the same sets of circumstances. There should be a code of honour so that the Commission publishes its answers to the questions specifically for the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that our petitions operate as a kind of citizens’ initiative that will form part of the new Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish all the best to those continuing this work.</p>
<p class="contents">As a fairly new member of the Committee on Petitions, it has been especially interesting for me to become acquainted with its work, which includes familiarising myself with its annual report. Particularly now, when we are having a debate on the future of the Committee on Petitions, it is excellent that we should have a report which, once you read it, makes you realise that the special position the Committee on Petitions has among the committees as a whole really cannot be emphasised enough.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that good legislation should be enacted at European level, particularly in such areas as environmental protection, where problems do not recognise international borders. How, though, will it benefit us or the environment if Member States apply European legislation only when it does not clash with other interests? Although the national authorities, and ultimately the courts, have the principal obligation to monitor compliance with Community legislation, there is also a need for European legal redress when citizens do not fulfil their obligations. As an ordinary citizen is not generally in a position to submit a matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to decide on, the options he or she is mainly left with are either to make a complaint to the Commission or to petition the European Parliament. It is, of course, primarily the task of the Commission to monitor compliance with EU legislation on behalf of the EU, but then again it does not always seem over-anxious to interfere in the affairs of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Petitions do not come from us in Finland or the other Nordic countries in any large numbers. One isolated case, which threatens the diversity of nature in Finland, is the Vuosaari Harbour Project in Helsinki, and that came under Community scrutiny having gone through this very petition process, an exercise the Finnish authorities have regarded as futile. Vuosaari is an example of a case in which the Commission has been unable, for one reason or another, to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">When you read Laura González Álvarez’s report, you can, however, say that the Committee on Petitions has proved to be an excellent route to open democracy and real concrete results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, true that many phrases were directed at Commissioner Monti that are normally not even used in Parliament debates. I am saying this to show that, in some cases, national issues do, where necessary, receive a lot of attention from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That I readily do in this case, but, like Mr Gemelli, the chairman of the committee, I want to go beyond what is conventional and especially place on record my appreciation of the work carried out over many years by Mrs González in the Committee on Petitions. She and I come from quite different points on the political spectrum but, in the Committee on Petitions, we all find that we share a common interest, regardless of nationality or politics, in protecting the rights of the individual citizen. Mrs González has undoubtedly been a doughty fighter for the citizens of Spain and particularly for the environment of her beloved country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is often accused of having a democratic deficit. Sometimes that is a fair criticism, sometimes perhaps it is over-stated, but the Committee on Petitions is a very real route by which citizens can bring their complaints to this Parliament and have them fully and properly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I sometimes say that, in the Committee on Petitions, 'all human life is there'. I shall take some examples from my own country, the United Kingdom. We have British pensioners who retired to Spain – who is to blame them! – but the British Government did not want to give them the winter fuel allowance that they had paid for all their lives. It was only after petitioning this Parliament that they got that allowance. There is a German citizen currently living in my constituency who thought that he was entitled to a pension from the German Government. It refused to pay. He petitioned Parliament and the German Government consequently agreed to pay. Furthermore, the pension was back-paid to 1995, so that was a very welcome addition to his income.</p>
<p class="contents">British customs services tried to stop British citizens using their rights to go to France to buy the fine wines for which that country is rightly renowned. As a result of petitions, that has been stopped and British Customs and Excise has been told that it must stop confiscating not just the wine, but also the cars of British citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Petitioning is a way of getting issues onto the floor of this House. Later on this morning, there will be a debate on the Lloyd's of London petitions. I too congratulate the Commission staff and officials. They respond very well to our requests.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Council is not quite so agreeable. I look at the empty seats over there and see that the Council appears not to be interested either in the work of the Ombudsman or in the work of the Committee on Petitions. That is a shame. It is not the Italian presidency's fault; it is a long-standing problem involving all Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we are too congratulatory I would, however, draw attention to the problem of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. I heard what Commissioner de Palacio said. I am sure her heart is in the right place, but it is high time that we had a code of administrative behaviour that was binding on the institutions, not voluntary, and a code that was uniform across each of the institutions. I do not consider that 2005 is remotely good enough. We have waited far too long to get this code and if the Commission would only adopt it, I am sure many of the problems the institutions currently face could be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs González for her work. This committee may not rank as the greatest committee in Parliament but, in terms of protecting the citizens, it is the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mathieu (EDD).</span></span>   <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Petitions certainly deserves our full attention. It often takes centre stage in the House, although it has actually been threatened with extinction at times.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to take the opportunity provided by this latest overview to stress that this committee is the best indicator of a number of the difficulties experienced by citizens. It serves as a channel through which citizens can make us aware of their concerns and expectations. Unfortunately they sometimes also need to use it to express their disappointment with the European Union. The vast majority of petitions come from citizens who believe in European integration and in the hopes it awakens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not presume to lecture the House on the many objectives contained in existing and draft treaties. The report before us is excellent in that it endeavours to provide practical and sensible ways of achieving these objectives. In the report, the Committee on Petitions and its members state their clear commitment to direct democracy and demonstrate the strength of this commitment by assuming the role of citizens’ representative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions, its members and its secretariat are an example to us all. They are constantly striving to improve their internal organisation so as to respond to the needs of the petitioners. I am sure all those present in the House today will be aware that my group and I are not inclined to mince our words when it comes to the European Commission. We never turn a blind eye towards it. I must, however, emphasise in this connection that the Commission’s staff have provided a consistently high quality of service in relation to the Committee on Petitions. They produce concise and straightforward responses in plain language. It would be wonderful if these same qualities of humility and responsibility informed all of the work undertaken by the College of Commissioners and its services.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, differences and divisions do exist. However, rather than ignoring them, the Committee on Petitions has shown itself capable of overcoming them to find practical ways forward. For instance I could mention consideration of the report on the monitoring of the implementation of Community law. On that occasion, the Committee on Petitions twice requested the European Commission to seek political solutions acceptable to all and in particular, to seriously consider the need to draw up proposals for the review of those Community rules that are most often incorrectly implemented or appealed against.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to commend the proposal I just paraphrased to you. It is far more relevant to ensuring implementation of the law than engaging in an increasing number of legal proceedings. The latter only result in an unhelpful exaggeration of difficulties. Misunderstandings must be resolved first. The citizens want to be heard in a Europe that respects the democracy and diversity flourishing within it. They do not want to fall prey to a Europe in thrall to judges and procedures. The Committee on Petitions is all too often undervalued, as are the Ombudsmen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would insist, however, that it is best for us to wait until we know what is decided at the Intergovernmental Conference. That will make discussions a great deal simpler. It will also make it much simpler for the three institutions to adopt such a code and, above all, to do so with Parliament’s full participation. At the moment, according to Article 308 of the Treaty, Parliament only has the right to give opinions and produce reports. It has no right of codecision, however. As I said a little while ago, I would insist on the need to postpone discussion of this issue for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the next question, I would say to Mrs Thors – I think it was her that asked me – that we in the Commission are prepared to review the current Interinstitutional Agreement. It is more accurate to call it an exchange of letters than an Interinstitutional Agreement, since that is what has governed the petitions procedure since 1989. I would remind the honourable Member, however, that it is actually Parliament’s services which should take the initiative in revising this agreement. We are, therefore, waiting for them to come to us with a proposal, which we will then examine with the utmost interest, in the constructive spirit which I believe we have shown in recent times and which has been acknowledged by various honourable Members, such as Mrs Mathieu and Mr Gemelli, Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, in their speeches. I agree entirely with what both of you said, because I believe that tools such as this are key to safeguarding active and effective democracy in Europe. The democratic system relies on these tools to enable its citizens to enjoy their rights fully, to complain, in some cases, when they are wronged, and to do so not necessarily by following every twist and turn of the legal route, but by using simpler systems, which may sometimes be more effective.</p>
