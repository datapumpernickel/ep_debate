<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tamino </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, no one can have missed all the press coverage of electromagnetic pollution over the past few years; public opinion is very alive to this issue. The reason why electromagnetic pollution is currently attracting public attention is that, unlike other forms of pollution, it cannot be seen and does not smell. People are not aware of it; they can just see appliances which could be the cause of such pollution. It was established 20 years ago, thanks to the work of Nancy Wertheimer in Colorado, that electromagnetic fields could have not only direct effects, causing damage due to heating – acute thermal effects, as they are called – but also long‐term effects, leading to leukaemia and cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">It was partly because of these concerns that, during the last parliamentary term, Messrs Vernier, Santos and Pimenta tabled a resolution which then became the report by Mr Lannoye, adopted on 5 May 1994. Parliament established certain facts in that report, including the need to apply the precautionary principle to EMF effects on the population. In response to Parliament's report, the Commission saw fit to present a recommendation – now under discussion – concerning the entire radiation spectrum from 0 Hz to 300 Ghz. As was pointed out in our Environment Committee, this recommendation lays down limits for acute thermal effects only. With regard to long‐term non‐thermal effects, however, it is considered on the basis of opinions from certain international bodies that there is insufficient evidence to lay down limits for such exposure.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, in a formal sense, most of the evidence could be said to prove incontrovertibly that electromagnetic fields cause thermal effects; after all, everyone knows that microwave ovens are used for heating food. But as regards long‐term effects, the current wide‐ranging debate has brought to light many scientific investigations, some epidemiological and others related specifically to cells and tissue, <span class="italic">in vitro </span> as well as <span class="italic">in vivo</span> , which indicate a probable EMF effect on cellular connections. This could cause the epidemiological effects which have resulted in leukaemia and cancer, as well as several other forms of long‐term damage, such as nervous disorders, amnesia and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The public is concerned not only about fixed installations such as electricity transmission lines, television transmitters and mobile phone antennas, but also about the fact that we are continually in contact with domestic appliances and other devices which emit electromagnetic fields; the best‐known one at present is perhaps the mobile phone, currently the subject of much debate.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, Parliament's Environment Committee decided to table various amendments to the Commission recommendation, so as to take long‐term effects into account. First of all, the committee proposes taking into account the health of workers and consumer protection, by introducing the precautionary principle and the principle that the best available technology should be used so as to keep radiation as low as possible. Next, the committee draws attention to the large existing body of scientific documentation on the application of the precautionary principle and, hence, the need to review the data and to keep it under regular review, as well as the need for reporting to the European Parliament. It also calls for higher levels of protection in areas where the public spend significant time, and for minimum distances from fixed installations and appliances to be laid down. It is however also true to say that the Environment Committee did not come up with any clear or precise data on ways of protecting the public from long‐term exposure.</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes my presentation – which is also on behalf of my group – of certain amendments which take account of long‐term effects and others, on the basis of the precautionary principle and of safety levels adopted in some countries, such as Italy and Sweden. This is the thrust of Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 19, 21 and 22.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, this is a recommendation and not a directive. As such it may not be transformed into a more serious piece of legislation for some years. The main emphasis that Mr Tamino has quite properly laid in his report, which is entirely endorsed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, is that the precautionary principle must apply. And here this principle inevitably means scrutiny, scrutiny and scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a powerful infant industry we are dealing with, in particular when we consider many of the reservations about mobile telephones. We appreciate its economic importance. Speaking not only for my group but for the majority of the Committee on the Environment, I can say that we did not think that the levels set by Mr Tamino were practical at this stage. They would, in effect, have meant the elimination of many electronic devices which are used in the home, as well as taking a major stand against electricity pylons and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we believe that it is absolutely necessary to monitor these devices and the Committee on the Environment's amendments have attempted to set out precisely why and how. I will read Amendment No 9 to the House. If anything carries the spirit of what Mr Tamino is attempting to do and what we endorse it would be Amendment No 9 as adopted by the Committee on the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It says that Member States should ‘lay down minimum safety distances from electrical equipment and minimum distances from public buildings, housing and workplaces for the siting of high‐voltage transmission lines, radar equipment and broadcasting and rebroadcasting transmitters, including cellular phone base stations and shall set down the recommended safety distances for use". Such recommendations should be ‘displayed on the product concerned, paying particular attention – because of the proximity and length of exposure involved – to mobile telephones".</p>
<p class="contents">These measures have to be taken immediately and the process of monitoring should thereafter be continuous. All of us would wish to see by 2001 – not in four or five years' time or ten years' time but within the space of 18 months – a further review of the safety measures used and of these instruments themselves. There are widespread public misgivings. There are a number of studies now which begin to suggest further cause for concern. When we referred this matter to Dr Michael Repacholi who carried out one of the original studies in Australia on the possible inducing of cancer in rats, he said that he believed that the standards now set down on the WHO guidelines were sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe we should further monitor this situation in the interests of the public, consumers and public safety generally.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Trakatellis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, the Commission"s proposal for a recommendation on limiting exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields concerns all European Union citizens, as this form of radiation has entered all of our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern stems from the significant increase in the environment of non‐ionising electromagnetic radiation. This increase varies from region to region depending on the proliferation of sources such as railways, tram lines, electricity lines, electrical appliances, broadcasting transmitters, mobile telephones, radar and so on. We must find an answer to the question of the extent to which public health is safeguarded from the effects of increased exposure to electromagnetic fields, because we do not have conclusive scientific evidence to establish the existence of any long‐term harmful effects of these fields on our health. Consequently, the international scientific community is quite rightly investigating and studying these effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, adhering to the precautionary principle, was the first body to request the Commission, in 1994, to put in place legislation and standards to limit exposure to non‐ionising radiation and to undertake actions, studies and research into the impact of electromagnetic fields on living organisms and especially on human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal attempts to fill the legislative gap that exists in the European Union on this issue. In addition, because some Member States have already introduced the appropriate legislation, the Commission proposal aims to define common principles at a Community level so as to avoid the introduction of non‐homogeneous legal frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">Further improvements were made to the proposal in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. Amendment No 2 calls for compliance with the precautionary principle and the principle of preventive action as well as the principle of keeping exposure to radiation as low as reasonably achievable, as defined by the World Health Organisation. The Community framework must be uniform and binding in order to protect the general public. It would have been preferable if a different form of legal instrument had been chosen which would be more binding than a recommendation, that is, a regulation, directive or decision, as Parliament had requested.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the recommendation we are debating must be reviewed at fixed intervals in the light of experience that is gained and that it must be readjusted on the basis of the results of scientific studies. A system to monitor appliances which create electromagnetic fields must also be put in place, at the latest by 1 January 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is necessary to disseminate information and to inform the general public, as well as to promote research to examine in depth the long‐term effects of electromagnetic fields on health.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation we are examining is a positive first step towards protecting the people of Europe and we believe that its implementation will give rise to substantive observations which may lead to further improvements being made to the legislation aimed at protecting the general public from exposure to electromagnetic fields.</p>
