<p class="contents">The issue concerns important environmental legislation which applies to access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making. Together with the Conciliation Committee we achieved a result in which we endorsed both of these, at Union level too.</p>
<p class="contents">The end result itself is, I believe, a balanced one. I am particularly satisfied that our Conciliation Committee adopted it unanimously. At the same time I want to thank my fellow Members. After some initial problems of interpretation, we found a common policy, which we successfully upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention throughout the entire process, ever stressing the importance of citizens’ rights in environmental matters. Openness and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy and a fundamental element in our own safety. That is why I am especially happy that we were able to improve the transparency of the institutions while retaining the powers, but also the accountability, of the institutions to which they are relevant. This concerns democratically elected institutions, such as the European Parliament, not forgetting the Council of course. In a democracy, the people are the highest authority and the decision-makers that they elect implement their will. That is why I did not consider it right to go down a path where politicians would be delegating power away from themselves to less open and less transparent agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Aarhus Convention, ratified by the EU and the Member States in the European Community, will be implemented by means of three directives, the two first so-called pillars of which have already passed through the codecision procedure, with conciliation. These pillars concerned the transparency of environmental information and the public’s right to participate. The fate of the third pillar, the directive on access to justice, is, unfortunately, still unknown. As these three Aarhus pillars were now being extended to the EU’s own institutions, that brought with it some legal challenges which set this regulation apart from earlier ones, those which were targeted at Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One area which became problematic during conciliation was the proposals regarding access to environmental information. Parliament’s amendments contained technical and legal errors, which was one factor in the reason why our Conciliation Committee was closer to the view of the Commission and the Council than was still evident after the second reading. The exceptions to releasing environmental information were one example of this. Parliament, after the second reading, would have liked to rely on Directive 2003/4/EC, intended for the Member States, as far as exceptions to access to EC environmental information were concerned. Legally, however, it would have been impossible, as the directive is only intended for the Member States. The final solution was to apply Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001/EC, which deals with the public scrutiny of documents held by the EC institutions and which is tailor-made for this very purpose. This way the approach is consistent for all types of information.</p>
<p class="contents">The other difficult area where we abandoned the view reached during the second reading was the right for the public to participate in the drafting of action plans and programmes funded by the EU institutions. Right at the start there had been some confusion over concepts relating to this amendment. Some understood that the amendments related to access to information, although the question was about the right to participate. We nevertheless negotiated a good compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">With these few compromises we succeeded in preserving the spirit of the changes during Parliament’s second reading, although we did also abandon some of them in the end. Other important achievements in line with Parliament’s policy were lengthening the period of time citizens have to make their voice heard, and broadening the scope of the obligation which the EC institutions are under to open their archives. Furthermore, with regard to access to justice, Parliament succeeded in extending from four weeks to six the period during which NGOs may avail themselves of access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In the regulation itself, NGOs have been given a special role: that of requesting an internal review with regard to decisions by the institutions. This role, now created for them by the regulation, is important for the Union. I wish to thank the environmental organisations for their involvement and their input during the Aarhus legislation process. Although perhaps we did not always agree, for example, on the scope of the rights accorded them, I appreciate and respect their desire to genuinely be involved in drafting better environmental legislation in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The future will show how well we have succeeded in our task. If the regulation is to work in practice as well as the two earlier directives, it will raise transparency in the EU to a level which will serve both our common inclinations and the public in the best way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say a special thank you to Austria for the excellent work it did as the country holding the presidency of the Council. This was the third form of conciliation which I led in my capacity as rapporteur. My experience of the Austrian representatives’ expertise, familiarity with the subject and negotiating skills was incredible, and I therefore have every reason to give Austria top marks for its presidency. Similarly, I would like to thank the Commission’s representatives for their excellent levels of cooperation, which I have enjoyed throughout the entire Aarhus process since it began in 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Korhola’s report makes it very clear that there had been a wide variety of developments in the legislative procedure and also some documents that certainly would not have met with our approval. Seen from this point of view, the compromise reached is undoubtedly acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Evaluating this text on the basis of the objectives given is another matter, however. These state quite clearly that, through public participation, every citizen should be able to live in the environment he or she finds pleasant, yet this objective cannot actually be achieved, as everyone has a different way of looking at his or her environment. The fact is that this is a noble objective and, if I take it as a basis, our achievements do not live up to it. I should also like to make the basic comment that this compromise, in particular, fails to meet the general demand for less bureaucracy, more transparency and more democracy; on the contrary, it is completely wide of the mark. The additional bureaucracy that this proposal entails is hardly acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, from my perspective, it is unacceptable to grant special rights to non-governmental organisations in the environmental field. After all, many proposals and amendments would make it possible for NGOs to block or amend legislative texts from this House and Council just like that. I value the work done by NGOs in the environmental field, in particular, but I also see them as just lobbyists and representatives of a certain movement, like representatives of enterprises or associations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we must follow closely what progress is being made with the legislative text, what the impact is on legislation in general, and also which objectives are being achieved – quite apart from the fact that I can also see this leading to harmful competition between enterprises and, potentially, to distortions of competition. We must monitor this situation.</p>

The most important thing at the moment is for this legislation to be applied as soon as possible. In that way we will increase our objective of transparency in the environmental measures adopted at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight certain positive aspects, such as the work carried out by the trialogue, with the participation of the Commission, the Austrian Presidency and the group of MEPs who took part in it. I believe that through all of this work we are improving access to information relating to issues affecting the environment, making the exceptions, and their interpretation, more restrictive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress, in relation to public participation in the adoption of decisions, that it is very important that that participation has been increased in the preparation, modification and revision of the environmental plans and programmes funded by the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an achievement for the citizens that, when adopting decisions on environmental plans or programmes, the relevant Community institution or body must inform, and not just make reasonable efforts – as the text previously said – to inform, the public in relation to all decisions, since in that way we will increase the transparency of this kind of process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to access to information, perhaps the most important thing is the agreement reached on the basis of Regulation 1049. Since this Regulation is in force and relates to public access to documents held by the institutions of the European Community, there will be a system for access to all kinds of information held by the institutions and bodies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as well as repeating that I hope this agreement will be approved tomorrow and be implemented as soon as possible, I hope that the Community institutions and bodies will recognise that its effective application will benefit everybody and that they will act on that basis. This is a legal tool that will in many cases help us to preserve the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Parliament and elsewhere we often speak about bringing Europe closer to its citizens. Well, Aarhus translates our words into action. I believe this regulation certainly helps to put flesh on the bones of Aarhus. Too often governments and other public bodies pay lip-service to public consultation and participation. It is seen as a necessary evil to be dispensed with as soon as possible; an inconvenience that the real decision makers have to endure. Too often public participation is filed away in some deep, dark drawer and very conveniently ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">That was and, in many cases still is, the system. That system has decided in its wisdom that the public – the ordinary citizens – whose lives will be immediately and permanently affected by certain environmental decisions cannot be trusted to participate in and influence such important decisions. The system is due for a shake-up and this regulation will significantly help that process.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström speaks of Plan D – for dialogue, debate and democracy. Well, Plan A, which is Aarhus, is surely a framework for ensuring that we can have dialogue, debate and democracy in environmental matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately we have not yet ratified the Aarhus Convention in my own country, the Republic of Ireland, unlike most of our neighbours in the EU. That continues to place Irish citizens at a disadvantage, as Aarhus is the world’s most far-reaching treaty on environmental rights and guarantees public rights to access to information and public participation in environmental decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation, I am sure, will be welcomed by those who have an interest in the proposed incinerator in Ringsend in Dublin and will have certainly greatly facilitated those with concerns about Corrib Gas in the west of Ireland. However, I am pleased that, in this House at least, we are going in the right direction even if some countries, like my own, are dragging their heels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is all too little transparency, and it is too hard for committed citizens to participate in the decision-making process, as the previous speaker so eloquently described. The Aarhus Convention, governing the conditions for participation by NGOs in the environmental legislation process, has addressed this issue. This splendid Convention has been ratified by all the Member States, but clearly has not been implemented as it properly should have been. Now it is the EU that is to ensure that this legislation is implemented. There have been many problems achieving this state of affairs on a basis that is merely more or less consistent, but so numerous have been the improvements introduced as a result of the second reading that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support the proposal, even though it is far indeed from being as good as it could have been if the EU had lived up to its own fine words about being there for the people. It is, however, a pity that the Commission’s clear text on access for NGOs to the European Court of Justice has been watered down by the Council and by Parliament. It is now not at all clear whether this access actually exists. We hope, however, that future cases will work out in favour of the NGOs, and thus of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Men, women and children are standing guard everyday in Pallaskenry, County Limerick, blocking their county council from cutting off the pipes which supply them with the clean, spring-fed lake water that they and their ancestors have been using for thousands of years and from forcing them instead to take a supply of water from the River Deal, one of Ireland’s most polluted rivers.</p>
<p class="contents">In another stand-off in Bantry, County Cork, people are camping out at strategic positions, blocking workers sent to run unnecessary over-the-ground high-voltage power lines across their farms. These groups are not only in the blockades but they are in the High Court, at great personal expense, and are being threatened by our justice system with prison.</p>
<p class="contents">With Aarhus these situations should not be happening in Ireland. Is there anything you can do to help us? Our government has signed the Aarhus Convention, which makes our government look good among its nation peers, but our government is one of the few signatories that refuse to ratify it and to give it effect. The Aarhus Convention demands that we the people contribute information and have access to it, that the people are part of every decision taken about the environment and that we have affordable and ready access to justice when it is necessary to protect the environment and the families in it.</p>
<p class="contents">By not ratifying Aarhus, the Irish Government thinks it can continue its practice of riding roughshod over its people, whilst kowtowing to any and every wealthy investor, regardless of the damage it will do to people’s lives, health and environment. This report seeks to urge a better application of Aarhus, but we in Ireland have no application. Please put pressure on the Irish Government to finally ratify Aarhus, even at this late date, and see the people as an ally rather than an enemy in the effort to protect the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The adoption of the Aarhus Convention by the European Union is a significant step in this direction. Environmental protection is the area in which the general public probably shows the highest level of interest in the performance of our institutions, and apart from having access to information, it also wants to participate in decision-making. Finding the balance between the ever-increasing publicity and maintaining the institutions' ability to operate is not an easy task. It would not be right to create a situation that would lead to the proliferation of court cases. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can expect civil organisations wishing to exercise their rights to operate in a law-abiding manner themselves, and in exchange, we should not infringe their rights with unjustified exceptions. This is why I am disappointed that the final version of the proposal does not include access rights to projects financed by European institutions. We can hardly expect citizens to identify with a Europe that accepts certain fundamental principles, but at the same time is ready to provide financial assistance to objectives that they oppose. Moreover, Europe should also provide an example to Member States in this respect, as we have heard earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I am convinced of the advantages of social control. I am aware that the affected bodies may often view social control as an inconvenience, and it may seem unnecessarily complicated to them. Still, at an overall social level, it does lead to decisions that are better than those made without the participation of citizens and their organisations. After all, this is the basis of democracy, is it not? Thank you very much, and congratulations to my colleague Mrs Korhola for her excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
