The project has been long and problematic. In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects. One example is the use of peat. Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned. It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union’s dependence on imported energy. Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU’s next round of enlargement. Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate. We are all concerned about the environment and our children’s future. The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner. We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come. For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mrs Matikainen-Kallström for standing in. She has already said something about the Altener and Save programmes. We now find ourselves in the final stages of a conciliation process on measures in the energy sector for the period 1998-2002, with Altener relating to the important sector of renewable energies. This is intended to create the necessary preconditions for implementing an action plan in this sector and, in particular, for offering additional incentives to invest private or public money in the production and usage of renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the current programme finished at the end of last year and the Council did not accept the amendments adopted by Parliament, the conciliation procedure had to come into play.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite amazing as to how doggedly the Member States in the Council tried to fight this programme for alternative energies and an appropriate level of funding. However I have to say the Finnish President-in-Office of the Council had relatively little power to act as long as the Member States blocked the necessary increase in this funding. The original financial package of EUR 81.1 million, as proposed by the Commission, was reduced by the Council to EUR 74 million, unilaterally and without explanation. It was therefore only logical that Parliament should demand the reinstatement of the original financial package.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the funding for the programme, there were a few other points that the Council and Parliament were in dispute over. It was possible, in the course of the conciliation procedure, to reach agreement with the Council on those of our essential demands, one being to examine the possibility of opening the Altener programme to the associated Mediterranean countries when this programme next undergoes revision. We were assured that the Council will publish a statement on this in the Official Journal. As far as the financial framework is concerned, had the Council significantly reduced its original package it would have come close to jeopardising the continued existence of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary delegation in the Conciliation Committee was concerned to secure the continued existence of the contents of a worthwhile programme. Hence we agreed to the compromise in the end, even though we were not completely satisfied with it. We accepted that the funding should be raised to EUR 77 million. That is an acceptable, albeit not entirely satisfactory outcome. We opted for this compromise so as not to jeopardise the continued existence of this programme. However it would appear that unless there are increased efforts on the part of the Member States, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of producing 15% of the overall primary energy demand from renewable energy sources by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we have secured the continuation of an EU programme that is important in terms of environmental and economic policy and that is instrumental in limiting CO2 emissions, increasing the proportion of renewable energies in the overall energy balance, reducing dependence on energy imports, providing security of supply and ensuring cohesion of local and regional development. Of course, the programme alone is not enough; it must be complemented by strenuous efforts on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On 9 December last year, the Conciliation Committee adopted the definitive text for the programme, thereby paving the way for the future promotion of studies and projects within the alternative energies sector aimed at tapping into the potential of renewable energies. In addition, the continued existence of the ALTENER programme will guarantee the promotion and implementation of pilot projects for creating and extending infrastructure, for transfer of expertise and for targeted activities intended to relieve market penetration of renewable energies. This will be of particular relevance to the wind energy and geothermal sectors, to smaller-scale hydroelectric powerstations, to the passive and active use of solar energy in buildings and to the use of biomass. These sectors show us how necessary and important it is to continue to provide a rational support framework at European level in the alternative energy sources sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would especially like to thank the Commission and the competent Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, for supporting Parliament’s position. The European Parliament has succeeded in reaching a reasonable compromise and amending the Council’s common position. I would be grateful if my fellow MEPs would endorse the Conciliation Committee’s end result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout. Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament’s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and – as has already been mentioned – we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community. This is not satisfactory – I would like to make that quite clear. However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed. For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption. This is the European Union’s declared aim. That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples. To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission’s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy. It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors. It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it. The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion. 75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions. In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory. Most of Parliament’s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive. The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy. There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however. The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States. This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy. However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market. Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment. The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up. Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness. Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy. We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also venture to raise the matter of peat? Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources. However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source. I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation. This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale. </p>
<p class="contents">In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion. Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there. In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone. In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit. It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables. I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector. I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities. I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland’s only Objective I region. I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies. ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported. An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million. We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million. In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to. In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme’s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision. It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available. This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.</p>
<p class="contents">And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives. And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary. Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive. However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result. I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
