<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, we are moving on from culture to education, professional training, competences and qualifications, and in my mind the two are linked.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 December 2003, the Commission adopted a proposal aimed at rationalising the European situation in terms of transparency of qualifications and competences. I am sure you are aware that this was a step forwards in the construction of the Europe of education and training. It is also a major tool to benefit citizens and enable free movement. Through this initiative we wished to provide real assistance to all those who want to have their qualifications recognised in another Member State, to give them more opportunities to find a job.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative was explicitly requested by the Council in its resolution of 19 December 2002, and was well received by the Council and Parliament. Several improvements have been made to the Commission proposal without any substantial objections, and I welcome this consensus on both the objective and the content of our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the proposal? It incorporates five existing documents into a coordinated portfolio called Europass, covering qualifications and competences from a perspective of lifelong learning: the European CV, which concerns personal competences; the language portfolio, multilingualism, which we had advocated so strongly over the last five years, the MobiliPass, which replaces and extends the current Europass-Training; the Diploma Supplement, which concerns higher education qualifications, and its equivalent for professional training, the Certificate Supplement.</p>
<p class="contents">By mentioning these various documents, I do not want you to think that is the end. Europass is supposed to be an open framework, and other documents may be added in the future. I am thinking, for example, going back to our youth policy, of voluntary activities that citizens do during their youth or adult lives, and social and civic action, which should be taken into consideration, because they are part of the personality of a human being</p>
<p class="contents">Although we agree on our approach to this matter, a number of amendments have been adopted. The Commission accepts them, with some exceptions. Amendment No 7 is not acceptable in its current format. It gives the national Europass agencies the additional task of making a guide to mobility available to every citizen. This task is not part of their primary responsibilities. Following the modifications proposed by the Council, a modification to this amendment was suggested, stating that Europass national agencies fulfil this task 'where necessary'. With this addition, the Amendment would be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 is also not acceptable in its current form. Firstly, the MobiliPass must be completed by the sending and host organisation and not by one or the other. Secondly, the third language into which the MobiliPass can be translated must be a widely spoken language. If it established joint responsibility between the sending and host organisations and did not confine itself to a third language or only widely spoken languages, the amendment would be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5, which highlights the role of social partners in the development of future sectoral initiatives, is in principle acceptable to the Commission. Following the changes proposed by the Council, a modification was proposed, removing the specification 'sectoral'. This modification is also acceptable. The same applies to Amendment No 8, which can be modified in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, Mr President, there is nothing insurmountable. The important thing is that this proposal aims to implement a service for citizens to help them to have their competences better valued, and we agree on this point. I therefore welcome the efforts made by Parliament and the Council to ensure that it is swiftly adopted so that citizens can use the tool from the beginning of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europass is the realisation of the type of policy that citizens expect from us. I think that it is a good project and I thank you for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unfortunate reality is, however, that we have found, and are still finding, that Europe’s citizens are not yet as mobile as we would like them to be. One of the main reasons for the fact that mobility has not yet been completely achieved is a lack of transparency of qualifications and competences. The lack of transparency, as we all know, is the most important obstacle to mobility in terms of training and professional activity and a significant block to making the labour market in Europe more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now submitted the proposal for a uniform framework concept for the promotion of transparency of qualifications and competences – in brief, the Europass – which has been long awaited and ardently desired. This Commission proposal is an exceptionally good one, in that it makes it easier for citizens to gain access to opportunities for mobility. The Commission has already said that in the new Europass portfolio five existing opportunities for mobility will be combined, namely the European career structure, the addition to the diploma, the existing Europass for professional training and references and, also extremely important, the European language portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">As already mentioned, these instruments already exist. However, they were not yet appropriately visible to the public. That makes it extremely important that not only the existing instruments, but also the networks, be coordinated and rationalised. An agreed portfolio of documents has a greater communication impact than a loose collection of separate documents. The important thing, however, is that it is an open portfolio, and I believe there are two reasons for this. In the first place, citizens can search for documents that are relevant to them. Nobody has to wade through all five documents. Secondly, this open system enables further documents to be included in the portfolio. I have proposed here in my report that the next document to be included in this portfolio should be a certificate of computer competence.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I would like to thank everyone, the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation, which has indeed ensured that this proposal can rapidly proceed through all the bureaucratic hurdles. I believe that we all have an interest in ensuring that this proposal is implemented as rapidly as possible and that the Europass is made available to the public as early as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This confidence must now be moderated somewhat, since I have heard, Madam Commissioner, that you do not agree with several of the amendments, including those proposed by me. Perhaps the administration could once again go through various points with me this evening, so that tomorrow we will in fact be able to adopt something going further than what we had initially had submitted to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for whom I have produced this opinion, has not only taken the project seriously and welcomed it, but we have also integrated it in our work. We know that mobility and lifelong learning are today important components for professional success and that often up to now neither the economy nor policies have put in place the conditions for it. This is now going to change.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we have made various proposals and additions, which we regard as important, for example the inclusion of third-state nationals – we regard this as a symbol of fairness – the inclusion of the social partners in order to make use of their know-how, the consideration to be given to social integration and, last but not least, more and better information for the public, providers of education and training and social partners, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. This is because the entire project will only be any use, will only be successful, if it is known about, if it is accepted by young people, by workers and also by industry and society. So it will be necessary also to conduct a campaign of explanation and information. Then, I think, we will be able to get this child onto the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because the Europass is something that really affects young people, even those who are entering their studies. I think we have spent a long time looking for this, and I am glad that the Commissioner can get it moving at the end of her current period in office. It would, of course, have been nice to pass this in the present legislative period, but we have to accept what cannot be done, and, if we manage to do this in September or October, that will not be too bad.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we should not overload the Europass with expectations of absolutely everything, we should at least expect it to make realities of those constant pious truisms, transparency and mobility opportunities. These are the stuff of daily life for young people and workers; they are often affected by European laws and still cannot evolve as we would wish. This means that there is a need for clear decisions on the European career structure. We must say very clearly what is meant by the specialist competences of the individual. It must be possible to include the language competence of individuals in a tested form. We should also, as you have suggested, take into account young people’s voluntary service, for that is a competence acquired by a young person in the course of his or her life, and it should be more recognised than it has been so far, including by employers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that there are very many opportunities to help young people to find their way in this huge labour market and in turn to be found on the basis of their qualifications. It is often, today, impossible to assess exactly what a person can do, simply because what his references say is not translated and basically cannot be compared. So I believe that in this Europass we have achieved clarity about training periods, the content of training and professional competence, and I believe that that is what we need, what young people need, in order to really experience Europe for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me say once again that my group is grateful that Mrs Zissener has taken on this report and we are delighted that in the autumn we will be able to get this matter going together – unfortunately with a new Presidency of the Council – in the interests of our young people and therefore in the interests of our children and grandchildren. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it will be extremely important that what we will be adopting tomorrow we should also be able to actually provide, and it is absolutely essential that this should go hand in hand with an advertising campaign. Its use, significance and added value must be made clearly intelligible to every user and person filling in the forms. As it is the purpose of the new generation of programmes, including the Leonardo programme, to achieve 150 000 trainees a year, it is absolutely vital that training providers should know about the Europass. Since this document is a formal recognition of professional qualifications, I ask right now for the administrative costs to be kept as low as possible, as these are among the major obstacles for all young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the Europass as vital, provided that it is not only an opportunity for formal qualification but also for informal competence. The really crucial factor – and let me stress this – is intercultural competence, because in future, with increasing globalisation, integration and interaction between different civilisations and cultures it will be necessary to have intercultural capacities and build on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobility pass, which comprises all learning-related and transnational knowledge from abroad, should also certify this experience. Both in the learning process and in professional life, mobility is required. For young people to be able to achieve an overview of this jungle of support and exchange programmes, the competent agencies, working with the Commission, should produce guidelines for mobility, making available exchange and support programmes, the names and addresses of people to contact, as well as links, so that the added value of Europe is evident to everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One slight note of caution: I was hoping that everything could be sorted out in the first reading on this report. I am not certain whether that has finally been agreed. I know that the Council presidency has been in contact with the rapporteur and others to try and achieve this result. As the Commissioner, the rapporteur, the draftsperson and other speakers rightly said, this is one of the key elements with regard to which we in the European Union institutions can point to how we improve people's lives on the ground; how we make their lives easier, both at work and in education. By putting together a single portfolio of all the qualifications and experience that citizens have, and allowing them to transfer that across different countries and different working sectors has to be an improvement compared with today's situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the late 1980s we have had this idea of a single market with free movement of people, goods and services, but the bureaucracy and the lack of recognition of qualifications and services was so great that there was no true free movement of people. This single framework aspect as proposed by the rapporteur is a positive move towards that.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of lifelong learning is one that continues to be of the utmost importance, not just because of people returning to education or to the workforce, but simply because of the technological changes which are taking place in the workplace and now in our everyday lives: whether it is about online banking, email or being involved in a technical process in the area in which you are working.</p>
<p class="contents">The one aspect of this proposal that will be of the greatest benefit of all is that employers, educational institutions and others will have a single document to look at, and this document will finally provide some idea of the equivalence of qualifications and experience across Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
