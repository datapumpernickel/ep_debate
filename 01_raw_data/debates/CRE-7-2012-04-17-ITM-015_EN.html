<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, junior army officers overthrew President Traoré in a coup on 21 March 2012. The takeover grew from a mutiny calling for better weapons and better leadership in order to fight the Tuareg rebellion advancing across the North. Following strong leadership by the West African regional organisation, ECOWAS, as well as continuous pressure from the international community – including the European Union and the United Nations – an agreement was reached on 6 April 2012 providing for a return to civilian rule with the appointment of the Speaker of the National Assembly as interim Head of State. He will then appoint a new prime minister and a government representing all parties. New elections need to take place as soon as the voters’ list can be updated.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Northern Mali deteriorated very quickly following the <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. The Tuareg rebel MNLA captured the three strategic towns of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu in quick succession after government troops withdrew. On 5 April 2012, the MNLA declared the independence of the Tuareg’s northern homeland, Azawad, a declaration which was immediately rejected by the African Union. We have also heard that the former Prime Minister of Mali was arrested for the third time yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The Honourable Members know that the European Union has been concerned by the fragility of the Sahel for some time. It has been increasingly clear that development and security have to go hand in hand. With this in mind, we proposed the comprehensive approach of the Sahel strategy, which the Council adopted a year ago, and appointed a Senior Sahel Coordinator in this service. The strategy includes a financial top-up allocation of EUR 50 million to contribute to supporting Malian security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Libya and its fallout exacerbated an already existing problem, causing well-armed fighters to spill out into a region where terrorism, hostage taking, drug trafficking and criminality were already serious problems. Coming on top of the recurrent food insecurity, a major food crisis has greatly worsened conditions for a large part of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout, our aim has been to work with the governments of the region. Where the government is strong, that works well. But the military coup in Mali undermined both the legitimacy and the effectiveness of the government as well as threatening the sovereignty of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I condemned the seizure of power by the military in Mali on 22 March 2012 and called for the re-establishment of legitimate government and the holding of elections as soon as possible. The Foreign Affairs Council of 23 March 2012 strongly supported the efforts of ECOWAS to restore constitutional and democratic government in Mali. Our development cooperation with Mali was immediately put on hold. This did not affect humanitarian aid, nor did it affect any projects working directly with and helping the people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have welcomed the agreement reached thanks to the mediation of Burkina Faso, acting on behalf of ECOWAS, and signed on 6 April 2012 by the military. I have also urged all parties – including the military – to respect its terms and to allow the swift restoration of full power to a legitimate government.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken with President Ouattara, who is acting as Chairman of ECOWAS, to reinforce this message. I also discussed the evolving situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon yesterday in Brussels. The inauguration of Dioncounda Traoré as interim President and the release of the detained ministers come as good news. However – as I have already indicated – the reports of the arrest of the former Prime Minister and of another senior politician are of deep concern. It will be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday next week.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the interim government is up and running, we shall discuss how best the EU can support the transition, including the holding of elections. The Commission is now preparing to resume the suspended projects as soon as the political and administrative conditions are met, particularly as regards fulfilment of the agreement with ECOWAS to restore a legitimate government.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be for the interim government to decide what support – including military – they may want from external partners, and from whom. We are already in close touch with ECOWAS concerning their proposals to provide support for the security sector, notably for the North, but we also need to work closely with all neighbouring countries – Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire – all of which have a clear interest in the events taking place in Mali. Such an option requires careful reflection on what the nature of such a mission should be and how to coordinate it with the necessary reinforcement of Mali’s national army and gendarmerie.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 March 2012, the Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly expressed grave concern at the deterioration of the situation in the North. It is not in the interests of the people of Mali, the region or the European Union for this to become effectively a lawless zone. The Council has made clear its commitment to the territorial integrity of Mali. A way must therefore be found to restore governance and democracy to the North.</p>
<p class="contents">This is made all the more urgent by the increasingly serious humanitarian situation. Overall, there are now over 200 000 internally displaced persons within Mali, and more than 140 000 are estimated to have fled to neighbouring countries. For 2012, we have increased our humanitarian aid budget for the Sahel from EUR 45 million to EUR 105 million. Across Mauritania, Niger, Chad, Mali and Burkina Faso, the Commission is implementing over EUR 250 million in humanitarian aid and food security actions for an estimated population of 50 million people. An additional EUR 9 million was added earlier this month for food, shelter and water for Malian refugees and internally displaced persons. For now, our primary aim is to deliver quick relief to the most affected and vulnerable populations. The EU remains committed to the preservation of the unity and sovereignty of Mali. It will remain in close contact with the new interim authorities in Bamako to define the concrete assistance in all the different fields – food, electoral process security and so on – that it can provide.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability in the region is essential for all Europe’s African partners. That is why we intend to mobilise all our efforts to find solutions, not only for the urgency of the next weeks, but also for the medium and long term, with the clear intention of assisting Mali in regaining its sovereignty in the northern part of its territory and being again a true united nation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A similar role was played by ECOWAS in the case of Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p class="contents">Of more concern though – for Africa but also for the security and stability of Europe itself – are the developments in Northern Mali. Heavily-armed and battle-hardened Tuareg militias – which served as mercenaries in support of Gaddafi and constitute an Islamist fundamentalist movement supported by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb – have managed to take advantage of the situation and take over the towns of Timbuktu, Kidal and Gao, unilaterally seceding and declaring the independent state of Azawad.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a development is against international law. Such non-recognised territories become safe havens for international criminals, terrorists and al-Qaeda followers, and would certainly be a destabilising factor for the whole of Western Africa from the Maghreb to Mauritania, Niger and the whole Sahel – an area known for kidnappings and lawlessness in the past.</p>

<p class="contents">We see before us a country in crisis, which, until recently, was held up as a model pupil, in particular, because of its capacity for democratic changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">Mali must now face up to three challenges: re-establishing democracy, re-establishing territorial unity and improving the living conditions of Malians, who are still dependent on external aid. How should these challenges be met? Of course, Mali bears the foremost responsibility. However, as the same threats affect neighbouring countries, the response must also be a regional one. This is the role of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), an organisation which works in close partnership with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As Europeans, we have a clear interest in supporting the Economic Community of West African States to reflect on a post-Gaddafi strategy, given that the upheavals in Libya are at least partially to blame for the events that have taken place in the Sahel region.</p>
<p class="contents">Our experience and our expertise in terms of cooperation in the most diverse areas puts us in a position to share information with countries experiencing difficulties. Europe’s strategy for the Sahel, formulated one year ago, integrates all these dimensions.</p>

All his children, of both sexes, had studied there. However, none of his children were still living or working in Mali because the situation was too dangerous, it was too uncertain, and the Tuareg felt too heavily discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">The man said ‘Those rebels, the Tuareg rebels, are villains, it is all very well for them to talk about Islam, but they have never seen the inside of a mosque!’ He is a reasonable man, but even he said: ‘I understand them and I support them, the rebels’. And I think that sends out a dangerous signal. When I left him, I had still not entirely understood what he was talking about. However, it is very clear to me that in Mali, we are not talking about a conflict that has just started. We are talking about a lack of cooperation that has lasted for generations and a lack of respect for minorities on the part of those who are in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">However, here too – and the same thing happens all the time – we again have a case of unfair distribution of wealth. There is money in the Malian soil, raw materials which could enable the country to become rich.

The MNLA (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad) separatist rebels must now hand over control of the northern areas which they currently control to the central political authorities in Mali, as demanded by the international community. Anything else will destabilise the strategically vital Sahel region.</p>
<p class="contents">The MNLA leaders should also now be subject to EU asset freezing and travel bans until compliance is forthcoming. Particularly worrying is the advantage gained from Mali’s internal strife by extremist Islamist factions. The al-Qaeda and the Islamist Maghreb, for instance, are almost certainly responsible for a series of barbaric kidnappings and murders aimed at westerners in this fragile region. I therefore now call upon the Vice-President/High Representative to mobilise EU resources to aid the constructive efforts of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) in restoring Mali’s territorial integrity and to engage fully alongside the UN with the newly installed interim President Traoré to help build a democratic Mali based on the rule of law and with the aid of new, free and fair elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the fact that the situation is moving in the right direction, at least as far as the capital is concerned. However, the capital and the surrounding area are only a small part of Mali. This does not resolve the problem of the occupation and the unilateral declaration of independence. I very much welcome the fact that the EU has agreed to do what it is good at, which is providing humanitarian aid. The aid will definitely be arriving on the ground very soon. I think we should also make use of the time we have to ensure that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) can play its role. Of course, we must also agree this with the African Union. We have already provided aid in other cases where the African Union has taken action as an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem in this context is the breakdown of the rule of law in the Western Sahara and across Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan and also southern Algeria and southern Libya. State institutions have a limited presence in these areas, with the result that a vacuum has developed which has allowed terrorist organisations to gain a hold. We must ensure that we put a stop to exports of small arms that promote instability in Africa.

I would just like to remind you of a feeling of unease in relation to this problem because, as we said before, we saw it coming. It really is the chronicle of a catastrophe foretold. We – I am referring to Mr Gahler, myself and Mr Goerens – who have seats in the ACP, have been listening for months now, since the Libyan intervention, to the panic-stricken cries of our Malian colleagues who said to us: ‘Something is going to happen in Mali’. We heard them at the ACP meeting in Togo, and the day prior to the coup, and in Brussels, whereby our colleague, Mr Assari, showed genuine anger and desperation when he said, ‘But you must help us!’ and the coup took place the very next day ...</p>
<p class="contents">So, we want to say, ‘How was it that we were not able to do anything?’ We had a strategy for the Sahel, we knew the facts, we knew that something was going to happen, and today we have heard people say, ‘We will support the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), we will try and foster regional cooperation, we will try, once there is a transitional government in place, to undertake development actions for some of these regions which are very poor’. However, might we not have been able to limit the damage as regards what is now happening, knowing full well that today, it is a real powder keg?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in looking towards the past and we must look forwards, but I believe that we must take into account all of these problems, as Ms Vergiat explained very well: it was a foreseeable problem and so we must therefore seize it with both hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Azawad, a Tuareg region of Mali, none of the commitments made to them over the past 30 years have ever been honoured. The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) is therefore fighting for recognition of the Tuareg people’s historical and cultural rights. In my view, this is entirely legitimate. However, it is a question of helping the Malian military to suppress the Tuareg movement, particularly due to the threat of Islamist terrorism in the region. That seemed to be what you were saying in your speech, in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to this option as the MNLA has no connection to, or affinity with, the radical Islamist movement. On the contrary, the Amazigh traditions followed by the Tuareg people oppose Sharia law. They propose instead a customary law system that is much more tolerant, particularly with regard to women’s rights. The Tuareg people and the MNLA will do much more to protect against fundamentalism than any military regime propped up by Western powers.

<p class="contents">Only twenty years ago, Mali was finally established as a democratic multi-party state with a new constitution. Since last month, the constitution has been suspended, and only eleven days ago there followed the self-proclaimed secession of the northern part of Mali, which has very worrisome links with terrorists and what we might call the aftermath of Gaddafi.</p>
<p class="contents">We first need to address the humanitarian situation there, because it is currently estimated that one tenth of the fifteen million strong Mali population is in need of emergency food assistance. Secondly, we need to support this transitional agreement, which fortunately has been achieved thanks to the efforts of West African states. That is progress, because if the position is established that no military coups will be accepted, there is still hope that democracy can be re-established. However, the main thing is to get direct humanitarian aid to these areas to prevent this situation developing into a humanitarian disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resignation of the President who was removed may end the political crisis in this country which had managed, following the fall of the military dictatorship in 1991, to remain fairly loyal to democratic principles. However, the encouraging changes are, unfortunately, overshadowed by the danger from separatists in the north.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that once a firm call has been made to the interim authorities to return to democracy and organise the elections that have been called for, we must condemn outright the aggression of the Tuaregs and extremist factions who have unilaterally declared independence for a region on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. We can no longer stand idly by in the face of the increasingly destructive onslaught being waged in Africa by factions under al-Qaeda’s control, because we do not want a Maghreb region controlled by extremists on our doorstep. This is not the reason why the European Union supported the Arab Spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One year ago, I had the honour of being the chief observer of an EU election observation mission in Niger; the Nigerien authorities – who knew exactly what they were talking about – and the few ambassadors posted there warned the European governments that there would be terrible consequences for all the Sahel countries if the Tuaregs, who formed part of Gaddafi’s army of mercenaries, returned. They said that those armed Tuaregs would unite, in particular, with their supporters in those countries and also with forces of the al-Qaeda organisation in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); they also warned that AQIM had infiltrated the Libyan rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased about the measures you announced for all the Sahel countries, but I would just say that those measures need to be taken urgently and quickly because otherwise, we are going to be facing a truly pressing problem. Most of those countries could soon come under the control of the fundamentalist AQIM forces, all of which will be happening on Europe’s doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">I should not like to finish without mentioning all those people who have been abducted by AQIM, and I urge you to take all possible measures to bring about their swift liberation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are already almost 100 000 internally displaced persons and 200 000 refugees in neighbouring countries, and the situation at the Niger and Mauritania borders is critical.

<p class="contents">In the current context, it is important to support the efforts of the African Union and the Community of West African States in seeking a peaceful, negotiated political solution to the conflict, without outside interference, that protects the people and respects the sovereignty and integrity of Mali.</p>

As they have said, it is absolutely right that the European Union should engage. We have a vital interest in the security, stability and development of the whole Sahel region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are firmly supportive of ECOWAS’ efforts and those of the neighbouring countries, and we are remaining in close contact with them regarding how we can help the political transition. I pay tribute to President Ouattara who himself, not that long ago, experienced enormous difficulties in Côte d’Ivoire and who is now very much putting his chairmanship on the line in terms of support for the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain very preoccupied with the situation in the North, and we reiterate our support for the territorial integrity of Mali. We are in contact with ECOWAS on a number of issues, including how to work with its ideas to establish a collective force to help the new, legitimate government to restore order throughout the national territory. We have most recently decided upon a civilian CSDP mission in the region and are considering what other support might be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am especially concerned that large numbers of people are being forced to flee the North in the middle of what is already a major food crisis. We are determined to offer our support to provide humanitarian aid everywhere we can, subject only to the physical safety of humanitarian workers.</p>

It is important for the democratic transition to be managed politically by civilians. A free and fair vote with international monitoring needs to be organised quickly in order to restore the authority of the elected representatives.
