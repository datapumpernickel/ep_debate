<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On the basis of the progress report drawn up by the Commission, in December 2007 the Council noted the progress Montenegro has made during last year, including adopting a constitution and establishing the necessary legal framework and institutions following the declaration of independence. The Council stressed the need for Montenegro to implement the new constitution in line with European standards and to continue efforts in broadening consensus on basic features of state building. It encouraged Montenegro to continue enhancing its administrative capacity and striving to achieve significant reform results, notably in strengthening the rule of law and fighting corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, administrative capacity is a weak point for a newly established country. The authorities in Montenegro are trying to address the shortcomings. The government is continuing to make efforts to increase administrative capacity and complete the reform of public administration. Although the legal framework has been completed, a great deal of work remains to be done. Appropriate funds will be necessary in order to achieve the government’s objectives. Overall progress in this area has been slow and consequently public administration is still weak and ineffective.</p>
<p>The new constitution has introduced changes to the judiciary, which has become less dependent on parliament as a result. Nonetheless, the provisions of the constitution must be implemented. Despite some progress, judicial reform in Montenegro is only just beginning.</p>
<p>Education policy too is slowly being brought up to European standards. Access to basic schooling is almost optimal in Montenegro.</p>
<p>The necessary framework has been established for the protection of minorities. Following the declaration of independence, Montenegro signed the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The constitution provides a firm basis for the protection of minorities but implementation is faltering in certain areas. The position of refugees and displaced persons, including a considerable number of Roma from Kosovo, is causing serious concern.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0288"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will certainly be aware that in December 2006 the Commission published a green paper and launched broad public discussions with interested groups (industry, traders, consumer organisations, etc.) on the functioning of trade defence instruments (TDIs).</p>
<p>One of the conclusions of these discussions is that a properly functioning TDI system is urgently necessary to defend industries in the Community from unfair trade or subsidisation of imports and to ensure public confidence in fair trade. At the same time it was established that it would be necessary to remodel certain elements of that system.</p>
<p>The initial discussions, which took place in the Council’s preparatory bodies in 2007, demonstrated that consensus could be reached on certain elements of the green paper, for example on the need for greater legal certainty, predictability, and transparency and independent decision-making. However, these discussions also revealed diverging views on certain points.</p>
<p>In mid-January 2008 Commissioner Mandelson stated that more time is required to continue consultations with interest groups on how to proceed with the TDI review process, and he gave an assurance that any proposal would reflect the legitimate interests of all the parties concerned. The Council has not yet received a proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p>The Presidency is continuing to make informal efforts to reach consensus on this matter between the Member States, and the next presidency will certainly continue these efforts. We support the EP’s efforts in this regard and we welcome any recommendations on reform of the Community’s trade defence instruments from the Committee on International Trade as a significant contribution to the internal discussions.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, as part of the world trade negotiations in Geneva in connection with the WTO Doha Development Agenda, discussions are taking place on amending the existing wording of the agreements on anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures. These discussions are taking place in a ‘Group on Rules’ and any results from the discussions in Geneva will also have an effect on basic European legislation on trade protection measures. One of the EU’s objectives is to strengthen the rule-based international trading system and to ensure that all rules adopted by trading partners are applied more consistently.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As was stated, on 3 April 2008 the Court of First Instance annulled Council Decision 2002/460/EC of 17 June 2002, in so far as it concerns the PKK, and Council Decision 2004/306/EC of 2 April 2004, in so far as it concerns KONGRA-GEL, on grounds of absence of justification.</p>
<p>The decisions which the Court annulled are no longer in force and were replaced by another decision. The Council decision currently in force was adopted in December 2007 (2007/868/EC) and amended on 29 April 2008 (2008/342/EC and 2008/343/EC). The PKK (and KONGRA-GEL, which is another name for the PKK) was listed in the annex to that decision. The Court’s recent judgments do not affect the validity of that decision, and it should be noted that the applicants did not want to challenge it in those proceedings, even though the Court invited them to do so.</p>
<p>As regards the procedure which it employed in adopting Decision 2007/868/EC, during the first half of 2007 the Council conducted a thorough review and consolidation of its procedures for the listing and de-listing of persons, groups and entities pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001. It now employs a clearer and more transparent procedure. This means that it now provides justification in respect of any person or organisation subject to an asset-freezing measure.</p>
<p>The new procedures were first employed in 2007 as part of a regular review which ended in June 2007 with the publication of an updated list.</p>
<p>The new procedures were also taken into account in the adoption of the decision currently in force and consequently PKK/KONGRA-GEL was officially informed of the reasons for its inclusion in the above list. In addition, the Council recently studied additional information on PKK/KONGRA-GEL and on 29 April 2008 accordingly amended the justification and then communicated the amended justification to PKK/KONGRA-GEL and invited it to submit its observations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it should be mentioned that persons, groups and entities included in the list can:</p>
<p>request the Council to reconsider their case, on the basis of supporting documentation;</p>
<p>challenge the decision of the national competent authority according to national procedures;</p>
<p>if subject to restrictive measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, challenge the Council’s decision before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 230(4) and (5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community;</p>
<p>if subject to restrictive measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, request humanitarian exemptions to cover basic needs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In connection with the separation of network operators from suppliers of electricity and gas (EU Directives 2003/54/EC<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 2003/55/EC<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), the question arises how Member States levy value added tax (VAT) on the operations of the separated network operators and suppliers. Some use the 'agent' model, which means that the supplier (the undertaking which transmits the energy) is required to collect VAT for the whole chain and pass it on to the tax authorities. Where this customary model is applied, the VAT payable by the supplier and his 'supplier' (the network operator) can be processed independently. However, if this model is not (or is no longer) permitted, the amounts of VAT which the supplier quotes on invoices to customers for the transmission service must correspond precisely to the amounts of VAT which the transmitting undertaking invoices for the particular customer. The supplier must explicitly quote on the invoice VAT on transmission as a separate item from the VAT on its own service. This mutual dependence of the supplier and transmitter is particularly troublesome to the businesses concerned in the event of a default on payment, change of address by the customer or switch to a new supplier.</p>
<p>Can the Council confirm that, following the separation of network operation and supply, the above 'agent' model is permitted on the basis of the EU law in force?

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Since the accession of Romania and Bulgaria the EU has had two Member States which border directly on the Black Sea region. Consequently, the EU is no longer an external player in the region. The establishment of closer links between the EU and the countries of the Black Sea region is in the interests of the EU and the Black Sea countries. This region has increasing strategic importance to the European Union since it has great economic potential, as a market of 190 million people, and is also an important transit route.</p>
<p>The European Union has already established bilateral relations with all the countries of the Black Sea region, that is to say in connection with:</p>
<p>– the pre-accession process with Turkey;</p>
<p>– the European Neighbourhood Policy (five European Neighbourhood Policy action plans – Moldova, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia);</p>
<p>– the strategic partnership with Russia;</p>
<p>– the appointment of two EU special representatives in the region, for the Southern Caucasus in 2003, and for Moldova in 2005;</p>
<p>– the EU Border Assistance Mission to Ukraine and Moldova (EUBAM); and</p>
<p>– the EUSR Border Support Team in Georgia.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to develop bilateral relations with various countries. However, at present it is the countries facing particular challenges which require coordinated action at regional level.</p>
<p>The ‘Black Sea Synergy’ initiative, which the Commission launched in April 2007, is designed to promote cooperation in the region and between the EU and the region as a whole.</p>
<p>‘Black Sea Synergy’ will be aided by the European Neighbourhood Policy and the other EU policies applied in relations with countries in the region.</p>
<p>Further key points to note are as follows:</p>
<p>First, stability in the European neighbourhood is a key strategic objective of European security strategy. The EU associates with this the embedding of democracy and the rule of law, the promotion of human rights, good governance, socio-economic development and the reduction of poverty, in other words the ‘europeanisation’ of the transition and reform processes in the region.</p>
<p>Second, on account of the need for diverse energy sources and energy supply routes the advantages which a greater presence in the region brings to the EU have increased in recent times. The Black Sea region is a production and transit region of strategic importance to the security of EU energy supplies. It has considerable potential in terms of diversity of energy supply and is therefore an important element of the EU’s external energy policy. Diversity of secure energy supply is in the interests of the partners in the region and the EU. Consequently, stability and security are all the more important to the EU and it would therefore like to see a resolution of the disputes in the region, which perhaps still pose the greatest obstacle to lasting peace and sustainable development.</p>
<p>In addition, good neighbourly relations and close cooperation between the countries of the region remain very important to the EU. Improvement in relations within the region will build mutual trust and open up the way to lasting progress.</p>
<p>The EU is not proposing the formation of new institutions or administrative structures. The Black Sea countries will continue to be the EU’s main contacts both at bilateral level and in discussions at regional level. However, the EU is of course willing to strengthen contacts with regional organisations.</p>
<p>‘Black Sea Synergy’ is not limited to economic cooperation. Its objective is also to establish a region characterised by sustainable democracy, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>The EU is making particular efforts to ensure that the opportunities for resolving existing disputes in the region are exploited. Too many lives have already been destroyed by the hatred, poverty and hopelessness which these disputes are causing. It is unacceptable for the European Union to close its eyes to such suffering on its doorstep in the twenty-first century. The EU can and must play a part in finding a way out of these black holes of despair.</p>
<p>The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States met their colleagues from the wider Black Sea area for the first time in Kiev on 14 February 2008. The meeting was co-chaired by Ukraine, which at that time held the presidency of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation (BSEC) (Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ohryzko), and the European Union (Slovenian State Secretary Andrej Šter and Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy Benita Ferrero-Waldner). The joint statement adopted at the end of the meeting is an important political document which provides guidance for future work.</p>
<p>On account of the Black Sea region’s strategic importance to the EU, in May 2007 the Council invited the Commission to review development of the ‘Black Sea Synergy’ initiative, on the basis of which the Council will be able to continue to examine its activities with regard to the region as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0302"></a>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) draws up key scientific material which is of decisive importance in shaping policy. The panel was established in 1988 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly to provide decision-makers with an impartial source of information on climate change. Its role is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the latest scientific, technical and socio-economic information published throughout the world, which helps provide an understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change, its actual and potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>The assessment reports which the IPCC has been publishing since 1990 show progress in the scientific understanding of climate change and its impact. The Fourth IPCC Assessment Report (AR4, 2007) presents the most comprehensive and reliable assessment of climate change to date. According to the report, ‘warming of the climate system is unequivocal’ and ‘most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases’.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly referred to the IPCC’s findings, for example in its conclusions of 30 October 2007 (14178/07, p. 10).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0307"></a>

<p>The Council is aware that food prices are rising across the world, thereby threatening recent achievements in reducing poverty and malnutrition and jeopardising implementation of the millennium development goals. This can also cause instability, as demonstrated by the food price riots in countries across the world.</p>
<p>The Council considers that it is necessary to take steps to provide short-term aid for the poorest countries and the most vulnerable groups in society and at the same time to curb food prices through medium-term measures, in particular an increase in agricultural production.</p>
<p>The problem of the sharp rise in food prices also poses an additional challenge to development policy. The May Development GAERC will also discuss the issue and adopt conclusions on short, medium and long-term measures to resolve the problem of the rise in food prices. The EU has already stepped up its provision of food aid and humanitarian assistance in the worst affected countries and released additional funds to help the most vulnerable groups in society. In 2008 the Commission has provided EUR 223 million for humanitarian assistance and food aid. As a result of the increase in the costs of existing humanitarian assistance programmes and of financing new ones, the EU will have to increase the funds available. Additional funds will also be provided by many Member States. In the medium term other development cooperation instruments and other appropriate Commission instruments could be used to tackle the negative effects of the crisis caused by the increase in food prices. In its dialogue with third countries the EU will try to dissuade countries from introducing bans on food exports and instead promote development-friendly use of the funds obtained as a result of high food prices. In the long term the EU will encourage developing countries, especially the less developed ones, to implement an appropriate agricultural policy, in particular as regards increasing food security. The Council is convinced that the key to increasing food production and global food supplies is to increase the aid given to developing countries to develop their own agriculture to bring about positive long-term effects, since that will enable those countries to exploit their potential for agricultural production more effectively. In that connection the EU will take account of the conclusions of the FAO High-Level Conference held at the beginning of June.</p>
<p>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council discussed the rising prices of food and agricultural produce at its April meeting and considered the matter again at its May meeting. The European Council will assess the situation at its June meeting and lay down further operational guidelines on this matter, in particular in the broader framework of the millennium development goals. The Council is also discussing this problem with its partners within the competent international fora.</p>
<p>In practice the EU has already taken measures to increase production and curb price rises as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. The temporary elimination of the set-aside requirement has allowed farmers in the EU to assign up to 10% extra land for production (in particular for the production of cereals). Increasing the milk quota by 2% from April 2008 is also allowing milk producers in the EU to produce more milk. In addition, the EU has lifted import duties on cereals and intends to extend this arrangement to the following marketing year.</p>
<p>The ‘health check’ of CAP reform currently under way will provide the next opportunity to adopt specific short-term solutions such as, for example, the final abolition of set-aside, a further increase in milk quotas, a further detachment of aid from production in other sectors with tied aid, and the abolition of the energy crop premium.</p>
<p>As regards the medium term, it should be noted that the accession of the new Member States increased the agricultural area of the EU by around 40%. The production capacity of the new Member States is increasing year by year. This promise, and the constant renewal and rationalisation of agricultural production in all the Member States, will enable the EU to make an ever greater contribution to world food production and thus to greater food security in the world.</p>
<p>In the long term, the EU should better coordinate the agricultural research and development projects throughout its territory in order to develop new technologies which will increase agricultural productivity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0311"></a>

<p>The promotion and protection of the rights of the child are an important aspect of internal and external EU policy. In December 2007 the Council adopted EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child in which it reiterated the EU’s unconditional commitment to promote and protect the rights of the child arising from key international and European legal human rights instruments, norms and standards as well as political commitments relevant to the promotion and protection of the rights of the child.</p>
<p>The EU has for many years made, and will continue to make, efforts to support the promotion of the rights of the child arising from multilateral measures, the most important of which are as follows:</p>
<p>implementation of the 2003 EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict;</p>
<p>raising the awareness of third countries, in particular in political dialogue, in relation to the rights of the child;</p>
<p>funding, in particular as part of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), of projects to promote and protect the rights of the child;</p>
<p>monitoring progress on speeding up the promotion of human rights in the enlargement process and support for the reform of child protection in the candidate countries and potential candidate countries;</p>
<p>annual EU sponsorship, together with the countries of Latin America, of a resolution on the rights of the child within the United Nations and regular urging of countries to sign, ratify and implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the optional protocols to that convention;</p>
<p>support for the efforts of the competent international and regional actors relating to the promotion of the rights of the child, in particular the efforts of the UN Secretary General, the UN Security Council, the UN Treaty Bodies, in particular the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Special Procedures mechanisms, the appropriate UN agencies, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and also regional mechanisms, in particular the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children and civil society organisations;</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 17 February 2008 the Kosovo Assembly adopted a resolution which declares Kosovo to be independent. The Council reiterated the European Union’s readiness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region, and recalled the European Union’s commitments contained in the conclusions of the European Council of 14 December 2007, as well as the agreement to Joint Actions establishing an ESDP Police and Rule of Law mission and appointing an EU Special Representative in Kosovo. In its conclusions of 18 February the Council noted that the Member States would decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. The Council reiterated the EU’s adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, inter alia the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and all UN Security Council resolutions. It underlined its conviction that in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under SCR 1244, Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case which does not call into question these principles and resolutions.</p>
<p>As part of its comprehensive approach towards Kosovo the EU decided to launch, on 16 February 2008, a civilian mission, namely EULEX KOSOVO. The objective of the mission is to support the Kosovo authorities by monitoring, mentoring and advising on all areas related to the rule of law, in particular in the police, judiciary, customs and correctional services. This means that the mission will assist the institutions, and judicial authorities in their progress towards accountability and in further developing and strengthening an independent multi-ethnic justice system and multi-ethnic police and customs service. The key priorities of the mission are to address concerns regarding minority communities, corruption and the fight against organised crime.</p>
<p>Following the declaration of independence, buildings on two border crossings between Kosovo and Serbia were attacked. In some places ethnic Serbian members of the Kosovo police force and other bodies resigned in response. On 14 March a large group of protesters in the north of the Kosovo town of Mitrovica unlawfully occupied the UNMIK courthouse. UNMIK made attempts to persuade the protestors to vacate the building peacefully, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, on the authority of UNMIK, police action was initiated to retake the courthouse on 17 March. The operation passed off peacefully but the situation deteriorated when the police tried to take the protestors who had unlawfully occupied the courthouse away for questioning. Members of the UNMIK police force and KFOR were then attacked, including with lethal weapons. A Ukrainian member of the UNMIK police force subsequently succumbed to his injuries and more than ten policemen and KFOR soldiers were injured.</p>
<p>On 9 April 2008, the Kosovo Assembly adopted, in accordance with the declaration of independence, a constitution which had been certified beforehand by the International Civilian Representative. In it Kosovo undertook to comply with the provisions of the Comprehensive Proposal for Kosovo and other forms of international presence headed by the EULEX mission and the International Civilian Office (ICO), which will have a special supervisory role. The constitution will enter into force on 15 June 2008. The adoption of legislation on the protection of minority rights provided for in the Comprehensive Proposal is continuing.</p>
<p>With the exception of the events in Mitrovica in March, the situation in Kosovo is peaceful and devoid of significant ethnically motivated incidents. Even the local (and parliamentary) elections which the Republic of Serbia held, despite UNMIK warnings, in Kosovo on 11 May, in collaboration with certain groups of Kosovo Serbs, passed off peacefully in the main and with no major incidents. UNMIK declared the local elections unlawful and devoid of legal effect since they were held contrary to the exclusive mandate of UNMIK to certify elections under UN SCR 1244. Serbian parliamentary elections were also held in Kosovo.</p>
<p>As the UN Secretary General noted in his report in March, the majority of the Kosovo population showed restraint in the face of the reactions by a section of the Serbian population, and the Kosovo authorities have repeatedly called for calm, patience and trust in the international presence in Kosovo. Prime Minister Thaçi has made many visits to the Kosovo Serbs.</p>
<p>The Kosovo and international public are awaiting the entry into force on 15 June of the new Kosovo constitution, which the Kosovo Assembly adopted on 9 April, and the consequences that this will have for the reconfiguration of the international presence in Kosovo, in particular as regards the future role of the United Nations mission. Intensive talks on this matter are under way between all the interested parties and the international actors in Kosovo with a view to providing a clear plan for organising cooperation between UNMIK and the EULEX mission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0321"></a>

<p>The Council is aware of these articles, but it has not yet initiated the investigations mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>However, attention must be drawn to the fact that the Guardian article concerns an attempted breach of the EU’s control system in the context of exports to Iran. The article describes, in particular, the unsuccessful attempt by a British exporter to circumvent export controls in transporting second-hand goods to Iran via Malta (no permit is required for exporting second-hand goods from the United Kingdom to Malta, since this constitutes an intra-Community transfer). The Maltese authorities, quite rightly and in accordance with EU policy, prevented the attempt to transport the goods on to Iran. The UK successfully brought a case against the exporter, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for the attempted breach of the export control system. This example shows us that although the export control system operated by EU Member States has shortcomings, nevertheless it is robust and effective. In no way does the Guardian article draw attention to a successful attempt to breach the EU’s control system.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, UN, EU and national sanctions are prescribed for the export of arms and other relevant materials to Iran. In accordance with the first criterion of the European Union Code of Conduct on the export or transfer of arms, every state must respect international obligations, which also include the UN sanctions. The EU Member States have exclusive competence, in accordance with their national legal system, in respect of the punishment of legal and natural persons who violate these obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0324"></a>

<p>From the beginning of 2008, dozens of leading trade unionists have been brutally tortured and murdered in Colombia, adding to the ‘record’ death toll of hundreds of trade unionists and journalists upholding human rights, hundreds of others having been savagely tortured. Responsibility for these outrages lies with the Government itself and the armed forces, as well as with paramilitary groups and private militias belonging to large landowners. This amounts to an undisguised offensive on the trade unionist movement as such, heightening the climate of terror in which the Colombian people live, notwithstanding popular opposition, as evidenced in the recent presidential and local elections.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council emphatically condemns the harassment and murder of trade unionists and defenders of human rights, irrespective of where these acts take place and who commits them. The Council has acquainted itself with the additional resources that the Colombian Government has provided for the protection of human rights activists, witnesses, journalists, trade unionists and other persons at risk. Despite this, the attacks on this group of people continue.</p>
<p>In Colombia’s case, the Council has already drawn the attention of the state authorities to these problems a number of times, and discussed the subject with them. The leaders of EU missions discuss this issue regularly. In a collaborative political initiative taken by the leaders of EU Member State missions in Bogotá and their capitals, on 15 April 2008 a comprehensive dossier on the human rights situation in Colombia was handed over to the representative of the Minister of Foreign Affairs responsible for multilateral issues. On the day after submission of the dossier, the leaders of EU missions in Bogotá met representatives of the relevant non-governmental organisations, to discuss the current human rights problems. The EU will continue its activities to protect human rights. In addition, on 19 May a statement was agreed by the Presidency on behalf of the EU, which condemns the murders committed and death threats made against leaders of social organisations and human rights activists in Colombia in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the fact that for more than a year the Colombian Government has been engaging in regular dialogue with trade unionists, and has made additional resources available to protect them and also human rights activists, witnesses and journalists, with a view to regulating this alarming situation. Independent investigators and observers speak of a definite substantial improvement in general security and a marked decrease in all forms of criminality in Colombia. In view of the increase in threats and criminal acts in 2008, the European Council has called on the Colombian Government to do everything in its power to ensure that the Colombian populace and the organisations fighting to improve the human rights situation can represent their interests freely and without fear. Furthermore, the EU is calling on the Colombian Government to ensure that the perpetrators of violence, threats and murder are held to account irrespective of their status.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0330"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In order to obtain more detailed information, it might be better to approach the European Commission. The Council, for its part, wishes to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the many reports, studies and communications recently published by the Commission, which contain statistical and other data on the use and teaching of European languages. A new communication on multilingualism is expected from the Commission in autumn 2008.</p>
<p>We are expecting this report to take account of the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers of Education at this year’s May meeting. The decisions are based on the opinions expressed at the Ministerial Conference on Multilingualism, under the heading ‘Promoting linguistic diversity: our shared responsibility’, which was organised in Brussels on 15 February 2008 by the Ministry of Education and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia and the European Commission.</p>
<p>We are convinced that multilingualism in the EU can develop only on the basis of a balanced and stable position for all the EU’s official languages, irrespective of the number of speakers. The languages with greater numbers of speakers are often at an advantage as a result, because they are more emphatically supported on the wider market of the language industry, so that they are better equipped to meet the challenges of modern specialist language. In our view, the new multilingualism strategy at EU level should also tackle these issues. We are convinced that the joint recommendations to Member States to improve their language policy could also help to improve the situation of every mother tongue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0331"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is completely in agreement with the opinion of Johan Van Hecke MEP, namely that ethically acceptable business activities must be supported, and it is working to combat illegal activities in the EU and in our relations with partner countries. Thus sustainable development is the key element of EU development policy, and the European Consensus on Development, the policy statement signed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 20 December 2005, clearly states that</p>
<p>the EU will help to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation, and in this way to promote employment and decent work for all;</p>
<p>the EU will lead global efforts to renounce consumption and production models that are not sustainable;</p>
<p>we shall help the developing countries to implement multilateral environmental agreements and support environmental initiatives on behalf of the poor;</p>
<p>the EU is wholly committed to action to improve the coherence of policy in the interests of development and of consideration for the goals of development policy in all policy fields that could affect the developing countries, including trade, the environment and the social dimension of globalisation, employment and decent work.</p>
<p>With regard to decent work, the Council Conclusions of 1 December 2006 on Decent Work for All stressed that the social partners, the business world and wider civil society must be included in initiatives supporting decent work, and called on companies and all other relevant players to promote decent work by means of action in the area of corporate social responsibility, i.e. action supplementing the rule of law and collective bargaining and taking account of internationally agreed standards, particularly those from the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention. The Council also supports the ILO’s Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, and the OECD initiatives promoting greater compliance with the OECD guidelines for multinational companies and the recommendations on employment and on relations between the two sides of industry.</p>
<p>The provisions on ethical government are the key element of our partnership agreements with third countries, particularly developing countries.</p>
<p>In the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries, responsible government is defined as transparent and responsible management of human, natural, economic and financial resources for the purposes of fair and sustainable development. The agreement also contains special provisions on tackling serious cases of bribery and corruption, and provisions on cooperation in environmental protection and the sustainable use and management of natural resources.</p>
<p>The aims of the strategic partnership between the EU and Africa agreed at the December 2007 EU-Africa summit include cooperation between Africa and the EU within the framework of international initiatives against illegal trade and the promotion of fair and transparent management of natural resources, confirming the Kimberley process; these include ‘Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade’ (FLEGT) and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Africa and the EU will also jointly address issues associated with combating bribery, corruption, forgery, money laundering and tax evasion, as well as other aspects of economic management. Within this framework, action has been taken to expedite audits and the return of illegally acquired assets and funds to the countries from which they came. The EU-Africa strategic partnership is already in operation, although it is being given shape by the first action plan for 2008-2010, which includes eight selected partnerships and priority measures.</p>
<p>The Cotonou Agreement and the EU-Africa partnership are being implemented in close cooperation with the partner countries, and in full compliance with the principle of autonomy.</p>
<p>To complete the picture, one more important element must be mentioned, namely the recruitment of staff from developing countries in accordance with ethical principles. In May 2007 the Council adopted the European programme for action to tackle the critical shortage of health workers in developing countries (2007-2013). In the context of its implementation, the Commission and Member States are currently examining the possibility of introducing an EU code of conduct on the recruitment of health workers, based on ethical principles and model methods from Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0336"></a>

<p>The Council has been carefully observing the latest social unrest in Mahala and other towns in the Nile delta that you mention.

<p>Communicating with citizens about the Future of Europe in general is a duty of the Member States and the EU institutions. Member States have the main responsibility on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but obviously the Commission must stand ready to provide information and explanations to EU citizens.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty, and in particular its contribution to a more accountable decision-making and the clearer rules on Justice and Home Affairs and the RELEX<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> area, is one of the Commission's communication priorities for 2008. The Commission started to plan its communication efforts on the Lisbon Treaty as early as September 2007 by setting up a project team, which is responsible for the planning and the coordination of the communication. The Commission also launched a website dedicated to the Lisbon Treaty in the 23 official languages. The recent re-launch of the "Debate Europe" online forum<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> should also help citizens can discuss the Treaty and other issues on the Future of Europe.</p>
<p>Most communication activities of the Commission are based on a decentralised approach. The Commission Representations in Member States aim at providing basic and factual information on the Lisbon Treaty. The Representations in close cooperation with the Member States' governments and Parliament Information Offices have drawn up national communication plans in order to answer to the citizens' needs with tailor-made information.</p>
<p>These activities include training for journalists, information relays and multipliers, publication of brochures and leaflets, organisation of discussions with civil society and local authorities as well as actions at schools and universities.</p>
<p>As regards activities organized by the Commission Representation in Greece, the Representation invites all appropriate speakers, to the extent possible, in order to ensure the presence, excellence and in-depth knowledge of all of the groups mentioned in the question equally. The Representation is also actively encouraging the EUROPE DIRECT information relays to invite Honourable Members, to the extent possible, to attend their local events.</p>
<p>Within the global envelope of €11,4 million allocated to the Representations to cover expenditure on decentralised communication in 2008, an estimated budget of €2,7 million should be absorbed by actions that will mainly focus on the Lisbon Treaty. A detailed breakdown for all these activities which are all ongoing – including activities in Greece - will be available at the end of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Communicating with the citizens of the European Union has been named a primary concern for this Commission, and numerous projects have been carried out in recent years, based on the three strategic principles of listening to citizens, communicating how European policies affect citizens´ everyday lives and connecting with citizens by 'going local'.</p>
<p>Can the Commission give a brief overview as to what particular action has been taken in order to communicate positive news of the EU?</p>
<p>Does the Commission have any findings about how its new approach to communication has improved citizens´ knowledge of EU affairs, and about whether it has had an impact on citizens´ attitudes towards the EU?</p>
<p>In light of the previous answers, is the Commission satisfied with results so far, and how is it planning to develop its strategy in the future?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This Commission has adopted a number of communication initiatives. These initiatives set out a long-term plan to reinvigorate communication of the European Union. These instruments also aim at helping the emergence of a European public sphere, where citizens are given the information and the tools to actively participate in the activities of the European Union and gain ownership of the European project. In this context, the Commission is also underlining the importance of a partnership approach between the EU Institutions and key stakeholders, including civil society.</p>
<p>The 2005 Action Plan<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ensures a more effective communication through a modern and more professional approach across all departments, including a more efficient organisation and a better use of both human and financial resources and communication tools and services.</p>
<p>Plan D<a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has stimulated a wider debate between the EU institutions and citizens. The recently adopted Communication on "Debate Europe"<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the follow-up to plan D, focuses on creating a citizens’ ownership of EU policies and on making the EU institutions accountable to them; on stimulating a wide and permanent debate on the future of the European Union between the EU institutions and people, both at national and EU level; on empowering citizens by giving them access to information so that they may be in a position to hold an informed debate on EU affairs.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the Commission's paper on "Communicating Europe in Partnership"<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> is to strengthen coherence and synergies between the activities undertaken by the different EU institutions and Member States, in order to offer citizens better access and a better understanding of the impact of EU policies at European, national and local level.</p>
<p>Answering to the high public interest in new technologies, the Commission adopted the internet strategy<a href="#defann_21_5" name="refann_21_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> in order to overhaul the EUROPA site – one of the biggest in the world, and to encourage interest in EU issues on other websites with a view to broadening the debate on the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission also adopted an Audio-Visual Strategy to facilitate a greater coverage of EU issues on existing and new audiovisual platforms; to encourage audiovisual media professionals to create and take part in European audiovisual networks, while retaining full editorial independence; and to increase the Commission's own production and dissemination of videos and documentaries to illustrate or explain EU policies.</p>
<p>Although these developments also depend on other factors, the standard Eurobarometer surveys carried out in spring and autumn 2007 show an increase in citizens' support for membership of the EU and trust in its institutions, compared to 2006.</p>
<p>Many of the recently adopted initiatives (EU radio network EuRaNet, Internet) are expected to deliver the bulk of their results in the months to come and the Commission’s communication strategy will thus focus on implementation in the near future.</p>
<p>The Commission is also working on new initiatives including setting up a TV network (as from 2009) and launching a call for proposals for Europe Direct information relays. New management partnerships with Member States will be in place as from 2008, and negotiations are underway to further extend the scheme in 2009. The Commission will also explore how best to contribute to the preparation for the European elections in 2009.</p>
<p>In order to assess and improve the effectiveness of its communication policy, the Commission has conducted around 30 evaluation studies since 2002, covering a wide range of activities (websites, information and communication relays, communication campaigns...). In line with standard Commission practice and the Action Plan, these evaluation efforts will continue and be reinforced in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There are numerous indications that the Commission and Council are applying a strategy in their work to avoid anything which might strengthen the Irish people's scepticism towards the EU and thereby increase the likelihood of their voting against the Lisbon Treaty in the Irish referendum. The final date for 'general consultations' on the EU's long-term budget has now been moved from 15 April to 15 June. What is the reason for that? Is it because the EU's budget is a politically sensitive issue and less funding for agriculture might boost the 'no' vote in the Irish referendum?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With its decision to launch a broad consultation on the budget review, the Commission has chosen a completely new and innovative approach to budget reform. Its objective is to stimulate a genuine Europe-wide debate beyond the institutional circles and build a new consensus about the future direction of EU finances.</p>
<p>This invitation for active involvement continues to trigger great interest across Europe. The Commission has received more than 200 replies so far and is receiving further contributions. The Commission has also been advised that some stakeholders are still in the process of formulating their positions.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, and to make sure that everyone wishing to contribute has the possibility to do so, it was decided to extend the consultation deadline by two months. This extension will have no bearing on the timing of the budget review. The invitation given to the Commission through the inter-institutional agreement setting up the financial framework 2007-2013 was to report within a timeframe of "2008-2009", and this timing will be respected.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to reiterate that it comes to the review without preconceptions and with a genuine wish to consult and debate about all arising issues. It would be premature for the Commission to take a position on the substance of the review and the Commission has never intended to do so in the first half of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0319"></a>

Does it consider the protection of free competition and the consumer to be a legal asset of major Community importance which would allow the effective laying down of criminal penalties to punish the offences set out in the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 September 2005 in case C-176/03 (the Commission v the Council)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member refers in his question to the recent Commission White Paper on antitrust damages actions and the possibility of Community legislation to ensure effective redress for victims of competition law infringements. The Commission would like to use this occasion to stress the significance of these effective redress mechanisms that have to ensure that the victims of competition law infringements can be fully compensated for the harm they have suffered. To that end, the White Paper offers concrete suggestions to overcome existing hurdles to effective redress. The Commission hopes the Parliament will continue lending its support to this important initiative for European citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>As to the criminalisation of competition law, the Commission refers the Honourable Member to Articles 23 and 24 of Regulation 1/2003, according to which it can impose fines and periodic penalty payments on undertakings that violate the EC competition rules. Those sanctions are not of a criminal nature (see Article 23(5) of the said Regulation). According to Article 5, last indent, of that same Regulation, national competition authorities can impose "fines, periodic penalty payments or any other penalty provided for in their national law." Some Member States provide for criminal sanctions for breaches of EC competition law. While welcoming this type of sanctions, just as any other type of sanction that contributes to the deterrent effect on competition law infringements, the Commission has no current plans to take a legislative initiative that would aim at criminalising competition law infringements for the whole of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0323"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member refers to the Azores case (C-88/03).</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to stress that with the said judgement, the Court upheld the 2003/442/EC decision by which the Commission had held that a 30% reduction of the company tax rate for companies established in the Azores, as opposed to the national tax rate applicable in Portugal, was a selective state aid. The Commission had concluded that the tax reduction provided an advantage to certain firms situated in a particular region of Portugal. For the Commission, the tax reduction was not justified under the Portuguese tax system because the said tax reduction was not available to other undertakings carrying out comparable investments or operations than the ones carried out by the beneficiaries in other areas of Portugal.</p>
<p>With the above mentioned decision, the Commission had also considered the question of whether the special fiscal status granted to the Azores region could justify the tax reduction in question. The Commission had however concluded that the reduction was not the expression of an effective fiscal autonomy by the Azores but it was rather an incentive by the central Portuguese Government to promote investments in the Azores. This also resulted from the constatation that the Azores tax reduction did not concern a system by which all local authorities in Portugal were allowed to set the rates of local taxes, but was rather an ad-hoc measure by which only the Azores could reduce the company tax rate set by the central Government by 30% so that the actual amount of the tax reduction was not decided by the Azorese but by the central Government.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member further inquires why the Commission does not recognise the fiscal authonomy of sub-national territories such as Scotland or the Basque Country while it regards Member States such as Luxembourg and Malta as independent national territories.</p>
<p>The Commission would first like to underline that Member States, however small they may be, can not be confused with regions, however autonomous these regions may be.</p>
<p>When applying the notion of state-aid to a tax measure, the Commission considers that the main criterion is to ascertain if the measure provides an exception to the application of the tax system in favour of certain undertakings in a Member State. The common system of reference should thus first be determined, whether local or central.</p>
<p>When reviewing local tax measures, the above determination shall be made in the light of the criteria set by the Court in the said judgement relating to the Azores. Most notably the Commission determines whether a measure was adopted by a body in the exercise of its autonomous powers and if the measure in question indeed applies to all the undertakings established in the territory or to all productions of goods on the territory coming within the competence of that body (point 62 of the judgement).</p>
<p>Finally, the notion of regional selectivity in tax measures will further be clarified in cases currently pending before the Court, notably concerning the Basque country (Cases C428/06 to C-434/06) and Gibraltar. The opinion of the Advocate general in the Basque Country case was issued on 8 May 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0320"></a>

<p>The Commission welcomes Parliament' support in the fight against organ trafficking and organ tourism as demonstrated by the "Organ donation and transplantation: policy actions at EU level" report, proposing a range of measures to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>Especially concerning organ trafficking, the Commission will closely monitor any developments both inside the EU and worldwide in collaboration with our international partners – the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation.

<p>It is extremely important that EU citizens should be made aware of the fact that the EU has a clear strategy on future enlargements. Discussion of the EU’s enlargement strategy in the European Parliament does not focus only on the strategy towards countries likely to join the Union, but also on EU policies aimed at countries with no prospect of accession, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Some people are calling for intermediate stages to be introduced between the ENP and the full enlargement process, others for closer cooperation between the Directorates-General Enlargement and External Relations.</p>
<p>Does the Commission take the view that the EU enlargement strategy should be kept strictly separate from policies which have a bearing on EU foreign policy as a whole, such as the ENP or the Barcelona Process: A Union for the Mediterranean? Or does it see a need for countries which are not yet ready for accession to be granted some form of intermediate status in the future?</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that the EU should rethink its enlargement strategy? Does it take the view that the EU enlargement strategy, which is essentially based on a series of stages leading to full membership (stabilisation and association agreement – applicant country status – accession negotiations – accession), is realistic?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU enlargement policy foresees membership as the ultimate goal for the countries concerned, and is therefore distinct from the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and, the Barcelona process: Union for the Mediterranean. Nonetheless, for an European country to participate in ENP or the Barcelona process does not prejudge its possible future accession perspective. Enlargement policy and ENP have a number of important principles in common as they both aim to enhance prosperity, stability and good governance and promote EU values in the countries neighbouring the EU. This is why the Commissioner in charge of Enlargement and his services cooperate closely with Commissioner in charge of External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy and her services in Directorate General Relex<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in developing and implementing these policies.</p>
<p>A further intermediate stage between the status of a potential candidate and accession does not seem opportune or useful. In this crucial year for the Western Balkans and Turkey, the Commission needs to be fair in applying the conditions while at the same time keeping our commitments on the membership perspectives of all countries involved in the process. Negotiations are ongoing with Croatia and Turkey with accession as their ultimate aim. In its 2005 strategy paper, the Commission outlined the consecutive steps for the Western Balkan countries on their way towards the EU.</p>
<p>The enlargement strategy is regularly reviewed in order to better address the challenges faced by the countries concerned and adapt to circumstances. This is done in particular in the annual enlargement strategy papers in which the Commission puts forward recommendations for policy adjustments. The Commission considers that the fundamentals set out in the renewed enlargement consensus agreed by Heads of State and Government in December 2006 remains valid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In eastern Chad, the WFP is now faced with the daunting challenge of pre-positioning six months' worth of food supplies before the rainy season for up to 500 000 refugees and IDPs, as roads are closed once the rains arrive. Donor contributions are urgently required in order to ensure that purchases are completed in the coming months, and that the food reaches Chad on time. Any delay could have a detrimental impact on the lives of so many people who rely entirely on WFP assistance for survival.</p>
<p>What contribution is the European Commission making to this urgent call for supplies? What moves is the Commission currently making to facilitate the agreement (which it brokered) of 13 August 2007? Given that the Commission is not prepared to include the armed political opposition in the reconciliation process unless they agree to a ceasefire, what action is the Commission taking to encourage these groups to lay down arms? How is the Commission ensuring that the National Commission of Inquiry which has been set up to investigate the events following the rebel offensive in early February will proceed with its work in an objective and impartial manner?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The humanitarian aid provided by the Commission to refugees and internally displaced persons in Chad will amount to EUR 30 million in 2008. Through the global plan for Chad, which is worth EUR 17 million, and the decision on food aid, worth EUR 13 million, the Commission is financing activities in the areas of health, water supplies, food aid and food security, protection, emergency shelter and education, which are being implemented by UN agencies, Red Cross organisations and international NGOs. With regard to food-aid operations under the World Food Programme (WFP) in Chad, the Commission contributed EUR 7 million in 2007 and that amount should rise to EUR 8.5 million in 2008.</p>
<p>The problem for the WFP in Chad is not, at this stage, a financial one. According to information supplied by the WFP itself, the emergency operation for eastern Chad currently has 75% of the funding it needs. The Commission has indicated its willingness to contribute a further EUR 7 million in food aid. To date, the WFP has not asked it to do so.</p>
<p>The WFP’s problem would seem to be more of a political and logistical nature, because the Libyan supply line (accounting for 37 000 million tonnes of food out of the 68 400 million tonnes that need to be pre-positioned) has been blocked over oil-tax issues. To speed up the delivery process, the WFP has opened a base at Faya Largeau, and the Commission has indicated its willingness to contribute EUR 1.5 million to the cost of that operation, but the WFP has not requested this funding.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that further delivery problems are likely to occur on the Cameroon supply line, where road transportation is shared by the WFP, EUFOR<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and MINURCAT.<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, it is hard to see the WFP’s problems in Chad in terms of financial constraints. At this stage, it is more a matter of logistical and organisational difficulties.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that it has a humanitarian commitment to tackle this crisis and it is in the process of considering the available options for meeting humanitarian needs not currently covered by the WFP. It also confirms that it is willing to seek out the funding that the WFP requires, once it has been requested to do so.</p>
<p>With a view to strengthening the Commission’s role as an observer and facilitator of the agreement of 13 August 2007, its programme includes provision, under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Instrument for Stability, for financial and logistical support for the electoral process. This assistance is intended to ensure that free and fair parliamentary elections can be held at the end of 2009 – a key objective of the agreement of 13 August 2007.</p>
<p>On the question of the armed political opposition, the Commission is encouraging application of the recent Dakar agreement, which addresses relations between Sudan and Chad. Applying that agreement would help to bring about a ceasefire involving all the rebel forces, thus creating scope for a comprehensive dialogue to achieve reconciliation in Chad.</p>
<p>Like France and the International Organisation for the French-Speaking World, the Commission has observer status on the National Commission of Inquiry set up to examine the events of early February 2008 and the subsequent disappearance of opposition leaders. The Commission has already noted an acceptance by the Chad authorities of its wishes concerning the objectivity and impartiality of that body, and it will do all it can to ensure that these values prevail in the approach taken by the National Commission of Inquiry and in its findings. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Title IX, Part III, of the EC Treaty (Articles 131 to 134) establishes a Common Commercial Policy. Article 133 provides that the Commission submits proposals to the Council for implementing that policy, and conducts negotiations with other States or international organisations in consultation with a special committee appointed by the Council to assist the Commission in this task. This Committee – the "Article 133 Committee" – thus assists the Commission in the conduct of the negotiation of trade agreements and gives advice to the Commission on the Common Commercial Policy. All Member States are participating on a weekly basis to this Committee where they are informed of ongoing issues and can react and voice their support and/or concern. The Committee is chaired by the rotating presidency and meets in the Council building.</p>
<p>The 133 Committee provides an important platform for policy advice and for enabling the Commission to get a good overview of Member States' views. It does not adopt legally binding positions on Commission proposals, or take formal decisions within the meaning of Article 249 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>When a formal act is required (for example, the authorisation to open negotiations), this is proposed by the Commission and then decided upon by the Council of Ministers, customarily in the General Affairs and External Relations Council and in principle by qualified majority. Unanimity is required in the areas of audiovisual services, education, transport, culture and health, services or commercial aspects of intellectual property when the trade agreement includes provisions for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules). However, the Commission works hard to forge a consensus on all important issues. This is necessary in order to ensure smooth handling of the issues at the Council, but also to have a coherent and fully endorsed Community line for trade negotiations being pursued or under preparation: the Community is stronger when united. On all occasions, therefore, the Commission tries hard to take into account the concerns or sensitivities of all Member States, seeking a satisfactory middle way that would reflect the Community interest rather than to isolate individual Member States.</p>
<p>The role of the Parliament remains limited under the current Treaty. However it is an established practice by the Commission to inform the Parliament on an equal footing with the Council, through the INTA committee<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Furthermore, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Lisbon Treaty will increase the powers of the Parliament in trade matters with the extension of the co-decision for legislative acts and the systematic use of consent procedure for international agreements.</p>
<p>The Common Commercial Policy allows the 27 Member States of the EU to speak with one voice on the international stage. This gives the EU, the world's largest trading block, a very strong role in international trade. The international mechanisms of coordination and decision ensure the legitimacy and accountability of the Commission's negotiating positions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In July 2004 the Commission submitted a proposal for a Directive on 'introducing humane trapping standards for certain animal species'<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for the purpose of implementing obligations and commitments arising from an international Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards signed by the EC, Canada and the Russian Federation and an agreed minute on the same subject with the United States of America. These obligations and commitments involve the introduction of harmonised trapping standards for the purpose of improving the welfare of trapped animals. These harmonised trapping standards described in the proposal cover also snares used for the trapping of the 19 animal species listed in the Agreement. The intention with the introduction of the trapping standards applicable also for snares was to ban the use of inadequate and inhumane traps.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a Directive was, however, rejected for a variety of reasons by the Parliament during the first reading. These reasons included lack of most recent scientific results as the basis of the proposal, lack of EC-competence to deal with the welfare of wild animals, calls for the application of the subsidiarity principle with regard to the implementation in the EU of the humane trapping standards, general criticism towards the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards, requests fore more freedom to address national and regional concerns with regard to trapping, requests for more benefits with regard to animal welfare and calls for an impact assessment.</p>
<p>To address concerns of the Parliament such as the scientific basis for the proposed standards and the impact assessment, the Commission launched a study on the description of the state of the art of research, science and application of humane trapping standards referred to in the “Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards” and described in Commission proposal in view of identifying the improved trapping standards which reduce unnecessary pain, distress and suffering of trapped animals as much as technically possible. Accordingly, an important task of the study contract is to identify those traps, including snares, which reduce unnecessary pain, distress and suffering as much as possible and which are selective. In the light of the results of the study which are expected in the first half of 2009, the Commission will decide on possible further measures to address this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission understands corporate social responsibility as signifying the voluntary inclusion by companies of social and environmental concerns in their commercial activities and their relations with their stakeholders. Companies behave in a socially responsible way when they go further in meeting social needs than the minimum legal requirements and the duties imposed by labour agreements. It is not, therefore, Commission policy to have a directive on the subject of corporate social responsibility. Nonetheless, if companies respect the principles of social responsibility, they will treat their employees fairly in the process of coping with industrial change. The same applies in relation to the proper use of aid from public funds.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the negative impact that corporate restructuring can have on the workers affected, on their families and on the regions concerned. However, it is not up to the Commission to express a view in such cases or to interfere in corporate decision-making, unless European law has been broken.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there are various provisions in European law to secure workers’ rights in the event of restructuring.

The Commission would remind the House that it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to apply those directives properly and effectively.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing a number of new initiatives, which are likely to be adopted in the near future, to encourage socially responsible management of change and restructuring – following on from its communication of 2005<a href="#defann_33_4" name="refann_33_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on that subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In connection with the separation of network operators from suppliers of electricity and gas (EU Directives 2003/54/EC<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 2003/55/EC<a href="#defann_34_2" name="refann_34_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), the question arises how Member States levy value added tax (VAT) for the operations of the separated network operators and suppliers. Some use the 'agent' model, which means that the supplier (the undertaking which transmits the energy) is required to collect VAT for the whole chain and pass it on to the tax authorities. Where this customary model is applied, the VAT payable by the supplier and his 'supplier' (the network operator) can be processed independently. However, if this model is not (or is no longer) permitted, the amounts of VAT which the supplier quotes on invoices to customers for the transmission service must correspond precisely to the amounts of VAT which the transmitting undertaking invoices for the particular customer. The supplier must explicitly quote on the invoice VAT on transmission as a separate item from the VAT on its own service. This mutual dependence of the supplier and transmitter is particularly troublesome to the businesses concerned in the event of a default on payment, change of address by the customer or switch to a new supplier.</p>
<p>Can the Commission confirm that, following the separation of network operation and supply, the above 'agent' model is permitted on the basis of the EU law in force?

<p>The VAT<a href="#defann_34_3" name="refann_34_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Directive 2006/112/EC, under Article 28, allows a taxable person involved in the supply of services, acting in his or her name but on behalf of another taxable person, to receive and supply those services.

This means where the energy supplier acts in his or her own name and on behalf of the network company transmitting the energy the customer can receive a single invoice from the energy supply covering both the supplies of the energy supplier and those of the network company.</p>
<p>Neither the electricity Directive 2003/54/EC nor the gas Directive 2003/55/EC currently in force contain any provisions or guidelines on taxation issues, which are out of their scope.

<p>The question raised by the Honourable Member related to a fundamental issue, the enhancement of the security of information and communications networks and systems.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Commission presented its proposals for EPCIP, the European Programme on Critical Infrastructure Protection. The Communication setting out the overall approach was accompanied by a proposal for a Directive on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures. The Directive is currently being discussed in the Council.</p>
<p>EPCIP introduces a sector-specific approach to Critical Infrastructure Protection. What the Commission announced in its Commission Legislative Work programme for 2008, and will present in 2009, will be the ICT sector specific policy to ensure a high level of security and resilience of critical communication networks and information infrastructure - like Internet - and to guarantee continuity of services. The initiative will aim at improving preparedness and response capability at EU level building on National and private sector activities. The objective will be to engage relevant public and private stakeholders so that adequate and consistent levels of preventive, detection, emergency and recovery measures are put in operation.</p>
<p>This initiative follows a number of other important measures related to network security recently proposed by the Commission. Firstly, in the context of the legislative proposals to reform the regulatory framework of eCommunications<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, measures are proposed to enable all stakeholders, including telecom operators and regulators, to respond faster and in a more coordinated way to security breaches and malicious attacks. More precisely, decision-makers would have to be better informed about the actual level of network security in order to be able to make better policy choices. There would have to be greater clarity as to the security measures that telecoms operators take to ensure that the networks and services they provide are secure, reliable and resistant to security breaches. In addition, service providers that suffer security breaches would have to tell their customers when their personal data has been compromised so as to allow them to take the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>Secondly the Commission has proposed an immediate extension of the duration of ENISA's<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> mandate that would give sufficient time for an in-depth debate on the future of network and information security at Community level, the extension being without prejudice to the outcome of this debate.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Commission has just launched a number of research projects in the area of Secure and trustworthy network and service infrastructures under the "Information and Communication Technologies" (ICT) theme of the EU's 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research &amp; Development running from 2007 to 2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Europe needs innovative technologies in order to achieve its objectives of reducing carbon emissions by 2020. These new technologies, which are often developed by SMEs, are subject to European standardisation. It seems that some innovating SMEs which manufacture new energy-saving products have encountered serious problems with the European Standardisation System. Instead of helping with the development of new markets to meet new challenges such as global warming, the System is preventing competitors from entering existing markets.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the revision of Council Directive 89/106/EEC<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 21 December 1988, could the Commission look at the transparency, impartiality and efficiency of the European Standardisation System for innovative products (particularly EOTA - the European Organisation for Technical Approvals – and its links with large companies) in order to ensure that the system is not distorted?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission fully shares the opinion of the Honourable Member on the crucial importance of new innovative technologies for achieving the objectives for carbon dioxide emission reductions by 2020. A transparent and non-discriminatory European standardisation system is of course a sine qua non for these goals, as well as for continuous efforts to safeguard the large innovative potential of European Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It is essential that this system works efficiently also for them, quite like the Commission has emphasised in its recent Communication on Standardisation and Innovation<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission however shares the concern that SMEs should be better represented in the work of national and European Standardisation Organisations and has already started to address the issue.</p>
<p>Within the more specific context of the revision of the Construction Products Directive<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (CPD), the Commission has recently adopted a proposal for a Regulation to replace the CPD. In this proposal, the procedures currently coordinated by EOTA<a href="#defann_37_4" name="refann_37_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> will be thoroughly restructured, with a view to considerably simplifying them, making them more transparent and also enabling the manufacturers to play a decisive role in them. In addition, new and stricter criteria are to be brought in place for the designation of the technical assessment bodies, carrying out the practical work. Apart from clarifying the current system, all these changes are aimed precisely at increasing the accessibility of the system, especially for SMEs, and consequently for strengthening its overall credibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Since 1992, the general thrust for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been to strengthen the competitiveness of EU agriculture and increase market orientation by moving away from a policy of price and production support to direct producer support.</p>
<p>In the context of the 2003 CAP reform, the decoupling of direct payments from production can be expected to strengthen further the competitiveness of the sector.</p>
<p>Short-term policy adjustments in the CAP have acted on limits that have been imposed on agricultural production. Compulsory set-aside from arable production has been set at zero for the 2008/09 marketing year and milk quotas will be increased by 2%, as from 1 April 2008.</p>
<p>Various adjustments are being considered in legal proposals for the "Health Check" of the 2003 CAP Reform, which where adopted on 20 May 2008. In particular, the removal of the set-aside and phasing-out of the milk quota regimes will further open up the market to additional supplies.</p>

<p>Safeguarding, maintaining and developing the European cultural heritage are important issues for all of us. Article 151 of the Treaty stipulates that Community action in this field shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity, and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore. The Commission informs the Honourable Member that the Culture Programme supports cooperation projects in all fields of the arts and culture, through an annual call for proposals. This programme can provide financial support for projects in the field of heritage preservation.</p>
<p>Under the rural development policy, a specific measure addresses the safeguarding of the cultural heritage in rural areas. The measure "Conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage" specifies that EAFRD<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> support can be provided for "studies and investments associated with maintenance, restoration and upgrading of the cultural heritage such as the cultural features of villages and the rural landscape".</p>
<p>Other Community policies address also the issue of cultural heritage.

<p>In the framework of the EU Drugs Strategy for 2005-2012, the Commission is currently drafting a proposal for a new EU Drugs Action Plan for 2009-2012, which will incorporate new policy actions reflecting new challenges regarding the trafficking of drugs into the EU.</p>
<p>Internally, the EU has set up a wide range of actions to combat drugs related organized crime i.a. via Europol<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (projects MUSTARD<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, COLA<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, SYNERGY<a href="#defann_41_4" name="refann_41_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>), Eurojust, the Police Chiefs Task Force (COSPOL<a href="#defann_41_5" name="refann_41_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> projects), Joint Investigation Teams, and new Joint Customs Operations on drugs.</p>
<p>The Commission also financially supports the reinforcement of the cooperation between law enforcement authorities of Member States, concerning the fight against heroin trafficking along the Balkans route to the European Union (COSPOL projects, Joint Custom Operations and Joint Investigation Teams).</p>
<p>Externally, the EU is cooperating on a bilateral and regional basis with third countries to address the drug problem and has become a major actor at international level. Considerable funding is being devoted to drug supply control. In addition, mention should also be made to the assistance provided to third countries to reinforce their capacities for border management and combating organised crime.</p>
<p>In this framework, particular importance is being attached to the main (heroin/cocaine) trafficking routes supplying the EU. The following examples give a more concrete indication about the types of current activities funded by the Commission in the field of drug law enforcement and intelligence exchange:</p>
<p>In order to address the increasing cocaine trafficking to the EU via West Africa, the Commission co funds (€800.000) the UNODC<a href="#defann_41_6" name="refann_41_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Project to Promote Intelligence Sharing between Latin America and the Caribbean and West Africa. The project will last 3 years, is based in Colombia and Dakar and receives the assistance, inter alia, from an EU police officer.</p>
<p>Another running project (€875.605) funded under the previous North/South Drugs Budget Line is the EU-Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Drugs Intelligence Sharing Working Group (ISWG) - the mechanism of intelligence exchange between the participating countries in the EU-LAC Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism on Drugs implemented by United Kingdom FCO<a href="#defann_41_7" name="refann_41_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. It is a regular forum where representatives from law enforcement agencies and the judiciary of the EU and LAC countries adopt best practices in the sharing of operational intelligence aimed at targeting the trafficking of illicit drugs through the LAC region and between LAC and the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission also attaches particular importance to addressing the challenge posed by drug trafficking along the Balkan Route and various projects to strengthen the capacities of the countries concerned are launched under the different geographical financial instruments.</p>
<p>Different initiatives are being developed to increase co-operation among EU Member States in the field of drug supply reduction:</p>
<p>Under the Prevention of and Fight Against Crime Programme the Commission has provided €661.000 grant to Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics (MAOC-N), based in Lisbon. It is a seven EU Member States initiative which matches up-to-the-minute intelligence with military and law enforcement assets to provide a rapid response to drug traffickers attempting to supply of cocaine to the EU. Its core focus is on non commercial vessels and aircraft, primarily from the South American and West African regions. The Commission has an observer status since 1 January 2008.</p>
<p>Some similar regional initiatives are evolving in other regions like the Mediterranean basin. The European Commission has also provided €95.000 for a Conference on a French initiative similar to MAOC-N but aimed specifically at traffic through the Mediterranean (CECLAD-M).</p>
<p>In the framework of the programming 2009/2011 for the Instrument for Stability the Commission envisages in particular to address the fight against trafficking along the cocaine and heroin routes. These initiatives would aim at providing a trans-regional and comprehensive response and by developing synergies and solutions towards the strengthening of the EU internal and external security.</p>
<p>Confiscation of assets</p>
<p>The Action Plan for the Hague Programme says that the Commission will review and, where appropriate, propose an instrument to strengthen present EU legislation on confiscation of criminal assets. The Commission is planning a Communication on the proceeds of crime for the autumn of 2008. This Communication will focus on the policy action which could strengthen the legislative framework and procedures for the confiscation and recovery of the proceeds of crime in the European Union. This Communication will be underpinned by the results of a study analysing Member States' practices in criminal confiscation, which will focus on what has proven to be effective at national level with a view to promote and exchange best practice.</p>
<p>As part of this process, in December 2007 the Commission issued an implementation report on the Council Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA on Confiscation of Crime-related Proceeds, Instrumentalities and Property, which showed that most Member States are slow in putting in place measures to allow more widespread confiscation.</p>
<p>The Commission is also supporting the implementation of Council Decision 2007/845/JHA on cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices in the Member States, which should allow the fastest possible identification and tracing the proceeds of crime. For example in March 2008 the Commission co-financed a High Level Conference on the establishment of Asset Recovery Offices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The merchant vessel Don Pedro, belonging to the company Iscomar, sank in the port of Ibiza on 12 July 2007. Severe damage has been caused to the ecosystem owing to the rupturing of the vessel’s fuel tank and escape of fuel oil and mineral oil, and the subsequent dense tar-like spillages on three of the island’s beaches, which had to be closed for several days. The Spanish Government ordered the leaks detected in the wreck of the vessel to be sealed, but in late August 2007 fuel oil started to reappear, after several storms had lashed the island, as did new patches of fuel, thereby causing further environmental damage in the natural park protected area. The vessel has still to be refloated and lies in 43 metres of water, with all the threats of pollution that entails.</p>
<p>What role have the European Commission, the European Maritime Safety Agency and CleanSeaNet played in this matter? Was assistance sought from CleanSeaNet, and if so, what technical solution did it propose to the Spanish State and the Government of the Balearic Islands?</p>

<p>Peace and stability are crucial preconditions for the development of Colombia. Past, present and future EC policy towards Colombia therefore focuses on securing support for the establishment of a solid and sustainable basis for peace. This objective has been furthered notably through the EC’s cooperation programme for Colombia. The Country Strategy Paper 2007-2013 allocates 70% of overall funding under the first National Indicative Programme (2007-2010) to the area of peace and stability.</p>
<p>Current EC support to the 3 peace laboratories – which are much appreciated by all actors (central government, departments and municipalities, parliament, civil society) – will continue until 2009 for the first two, and until the 2010-2011 for the third laboratory. Thereafter, a new programme, to be committed later in 2008, is to take the relay.</p>
<p>This € 28 million programme, entitled “Regional development for peace and stability”, will further consolidate ongoing processes already being implemented through the existing peace laboratories. It will also prepare the ground for, and allow a transition towards, a potential future EC-supported action which applies the approaches developed successfully in the framework of the peace laboratories at a more systemic, ideally nation-wide level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0327"></a>

<p>On 19 April 2008, large-scale strawberry farmers and their henchmen carried out a murderous attack at Nea Manolada, Ilia, on migrant agricultural workers taking part in strike action and on members of PAME (the All Workers Militant Front) and the KKE (Communist Party of Greece) who were demonstrating in support of their just struggle. The indulgence and, effectively, support shown by the police and judicial authorities towards the strawberry farmers was provocative. Such events are encouraged and cultivated by the policy of exploitation of immigrants pursued by governments and the EU in Greece, Italy and other Member States.</p>

<p>The Commission cannot take a position on events of which it has only heard through the press. However, beyond this specific event the Honourable Member refers to, the Commission rejects any violence and exploitation of immigrants, regardless of their legal status. Member States must ensure that fundamental rights are effectively respected, and thus protect human life and the integrity of persons.</p>
<p>The EU´s common immigration policy is committed to a comprehensive approach that deals with all aspects of migration flows. Legal migration should be governed by clear, transparent and fair rules. At the same time, strong measures are needed to prevent and reduce illegal immigration.</p>
<p>It is long-standing policy that legally staying and working migrants should enjoy the same socio-economic rights as own nationals of that Member State. The 2003 Directive on long-term residents and the recent proposal for a framework Directive on migrant workers legally residing in a Member State are examples of this approach.</p>
<p>As announced in its 2005 policy plan on legal migration, the Commission will soon present a proposal for a Directive on conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers. The proposal will contain, amongst others, provisions on certain rights of seasonal workers, such as the right to non-discrimination with regard to working conditions, including levels of pay.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU needs to fight more vigorously illegal immigration and undeclared work, as these do not only undermine the possibilities to manage legal migration, but also often lead to exploitative working conditions for the persons concerned. This is a complex phenomenon with multiple drivers, and so must be the responses.</p>
<p>In this context it is important to mention the Commission’s proposal for a directive providing for sanctions against employers of third-country workers who are illegally staying in the EU. The proposal aims to contribute to reducing illegal immigration. Under the proposal, Member States would introduce similar preventive measures and penalties against the employers, and enforce them effectively. Penalties should include fines and other administrative sanctions. There should also be criminal penalties in serious cases, such as where illegally staying third-country nationals have been employed under particularly exploitative working conditions.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that those proposals on both illegal and legal migration will be adopted soon, as stronger EU legislation can help prevent situations like the one to which the Honourable Member refers to.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0329"></a>

<p>Responsibility for child protection, including assistance for children with special needs, such as mentally disabled children, and their families, lies with the Member States. The Commission is therefore not in charge of specific measures to assist children with special needs and their families in their efforts to secure the establishment and consolidation of public infrastructure meeting present-day needs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is not and has never been indifferent to the situation of children with special needs and their families. In this area the Commission supports the action of the Member States, in great measure through the interventions of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Financial help through the European Social Fund, the promotion of access to quality support and care services, awareness-raising activities and the establishment of platforms for exchange of good practice are among the tools the EU uses to promote social inclusion of children with special needs and their families.</p>
<p>Also, the European Regional Development Fund, through the operational programmes it co-funds under the Third Community Support Framework for Greece (2000-2006), provided financial assistance to projects aiming at supporting people with special needs, including children. To mention only the most notable examples, measure 5.1 of the operational programme "Education and Initial Professional Training 2000-2006" is devoted exclusively to the improvement of the physical infrastructure of educational facilities for pupils with special needs, with a total public budget of € 7,629,562.</p>
<p>Similarly, operational programme "Health and Welfare 2000-2006" funds several projects supporting groups with special needs, including rare and severely disabling diseases, such as childhood cancers. For instance, one such project entails the procurement of radiotherapy equipment for children, intended for use at the P. &amp; A. Kyriakou Children's Hospital in Athens (total public budget of €7 million). Finally, most of Greece's thirteen regional operational programmes include measures devoted to the improvement of healthcare infrastructure and the promotion of social support services, which may also fund actions for people with special needs, including children.</p>
<p>Additionally, under the fourth programming period (2007-2013) of the Structural Funds, all of Greece's five regional operational programmes include priority axes devoted to the improvement of citizens' quality of life, which will fund, among other, infrastructure and services of health and social care, including relevant actions for people with special needs. In fact, the criteria for the evaluation of project proposals elaborated by the Greek authorities for the selection of projects to be funded by the aforementioned operational programmes make distinct and extensive reference to the needs of people with disabilities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0335"></a>

<p>Following the import into Spain of Ukrainian sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oils, the Commission has provided assurances that the national authorities had taken all appropriate action.</p>
<p>However, a number of Spanish agricultural organisations have accused their country's government of not carrying out adequate checks on imports from non-EU countries, thus jeopardising food safety in Spain.</p>
<p>Is the Commission planning to verify the border checks carried out in Spain with a view to preventing any repetition of cases such as the sunflower-oil one which jeopardise food safety? Is there any means of compensating Spanish producers for the financial loss they have suffered on account of the imports of contaminated oil?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) received on 23 April 2008 a notification from the competent authorities of France concerning the presence of mineral oil in sunflower oil originating from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Investigations as regards the source of contamination are still ongoing but the contamination is possibly linked to the fraudulent addition of mineral oil to crude sunflower oil.</p>
<p>Given that the presence of mineral oil in sunflower oil is linked to fraud, such a contamination is not predictable. It is therefore very difficult to prevent such contaminated oil entering the food chain, even with a strict control system in place.</p>
<p>However, following the finding of the mineral oil in sunflower oil originating from Ukraine, the Commission asked the authorities from Ukraine to guarantee for all future consignments the absence of unacceptable levels of mineral oil in sunflower oil based on sampling and analysis.</p>
<p>The Commission asked the competent authorities from the Member States to control all consignments of sunflower oil originating from Ukraine on the presence of mineral oil before release on the market.</p>
<p>Also a reinforcement of the controls on the presence of mineral oil in all vegetable oils imported into the EU was requested.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FEDIOL, representing the EU vegetable oil industry, made the commitment to check all imported consignments of vegetable oils of all origins for the presence of mineral oil.</p>
<p>These measures should minimize the risk that such a contamination could occur again.</p>
<p>The Community budget does not foresee the possibility to compensate the Spanish producers for the possible financial loss incurred due to the import of contaminated oil.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0340"></a>

<p>In late April the German media reported that experts in the governing CDU/CSU and SPD coalition parties had agreed to the extension until 2011 of the transitional period for access to the German labour market by nationals of the new Member States. The decision was confirmed by Olaf Scholz, the Minister for Labour within the German Government. Everything therefore points to it soon being endorsed by the German Government as a whole.</p>
<p>Such a decision by the largest EU Member State, Germany, which is at the same time calling for the swift entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which states, in the common provisions, that the Union 'shall combat (...) discrimination', would be a clear instance of labour-market discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p>
<p>What approaches will be Commission be making to the German Government with a view to its opening up its labour market to nationals of the new Member States at the earliest opportunity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that under the Accession Treaties the Member States are entitled not to grant free access to their labour markets to workers from some of the Member States that joined in 2004 and 2007 and this does not constitute discrimination contrary to EC law.</p>
<p>The transitional arrangements set out in the Accession Treaties of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 allow the other Member States temporarily to restrict the fundamental freedom to move to other EU Member States by making access to labour markets by workers from the Member States that joined recently subject to national law. The fact that these workers are treated differently from other EU workers does not amount to discrimination contrary to EC law on the basis of nationality: the EC Treaty prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality, but without prejudice to special Treaty provisions, such as the transitional arrangements in the Accession Treaties.</p>
<p>A Member State that restricts access to its labour market must nevertheless comply with the conditions set out in the transitional arrangements in the Accession Treaties. The overall transitional period of seven years is divided into three phases (2+3+2 years) and different conditions apply during each phase: during the first and second phases, it is for each Member State to decide whether or not to open its labour market to workers from those countries.</p>
<p>In principle, however, restrictions on access to the labour market will end after these first two phases, i.e. five years after accession (on 30 April 2009 as regards workers from the Member States that joined in 2004). Restrictions may continue to apply for a further two years after that date only where there is a serious disturbance of the labour market, or threat thereof, and the Commission must be notified of this before the end of the fifth year after accession.</p>
<p>From 30 April 2009, therefore, the Member States may no longer decide on their own discretion to continue to restrict access to their labour markets until 2011, and the Commission will fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties in ensuring compliance with the conditions set out in the Accession Treaties. In addition, as the transitional arrangements constitute a derogation from a fundamental freedom and since the conditions for derogations from fundamental freedoms must be interpreted strictly, the Commission expects the Member States to provide a high level of evidence of a serious disturbance of the labour market, or a threat thereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
