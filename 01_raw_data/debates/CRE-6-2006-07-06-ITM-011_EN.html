The results of the meeting in Geneva should not deflect our commitment to multilateralism, to organised international economic relations and to balanced and fair world trade governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I do not understand why the Union continues to be at a disadvantage in the agricultural sector. We all know that it has demonstrated a constructive negotiating stand. The negotiating emphasis, with concessions, is being dictated by other leading developed and dynamically developing actors. We must stamp out the delusions which some of our trading parties are taking pains to maintain.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, agricultural liberalisation is not a panacea for development. On the contrary, it is only expected to benefit a few competitive exporters, such as Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina. All recent economic studies agree that the greatest benefits from the current round are expected from the opening up of the industrial products and trade services markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the liberalisation of industrial products and services does not only constitute an aggressive interest on the part of developed countries. Gradual liberalisation, with the necessary technical assistance, will prove to be of benefit to developing countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, special treatment for developing countries is absolutely positive. At the same time, however, it is by looking outwards that these countries will help themselves to integrate more effectively into the global trade system. When it comes to the multilateralism or bilateralism/regionalism dilemma, we are unreservedly in favour of multilateral trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, further negotiation is needed, but keeping the principle of uniform commitment intact. I believe that there are still margins for agreement. The Doha round must not founder. It is accompanied by major ambitions and expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to extend my particular thanks to the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, for his detailed report on the Geneva meeting and to honestly congratulate him on his negotiating stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the breakdown of negotiations in Geneva last week created a climate of scaremongering; that was the climate that was cultivated. However, I believe that this climate must not under any circumstances put pressure on the Commission or on Commissioner Mandelson to continue to make concessions, especially in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I fear that, as the European Union and as the European Commission, we have lost the battle for our positions. We have lost at the level of communication and I believe that we need to take particular care here. Our message must be crystal clear. We want a balanced and logical compromise that will cover all sectors of the Doha round. However, any such compromise cannot be at the expense of the agricultural sector of the European Union. Hence, for us the position is the mandate from the Council of Ministers and the revised common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I should like you to explain to us something you have said on numerous occasions recently: what does 'the European Commission will demonstrate conditional flexibility' mean? I fear that this is being exploited by our trading partners in order to exert greater pressure on the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I listened to what the Commissioner had to say this morning. He spoke of real cuts in agricultural subsidies by all and he used the phrase ‘operating to the limit of our flexibility’. I want to ask him about that flexibility and the mandate he has from the Council of Ministers with regard to trade concessions in agriculture. Has the negotiating mandate set out in the Council conclusions and the Luxembourg Agreement changed? While I do not expect him to give me precise details of his negotiating position, I would like to know what the broad parameters of that flexibility are and if there is a limit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner also said that he had negotiated alongside Commissioner Fischer Boel in Geneva last week. Does he agree with her statement last week that if we accepted the G20 proposals in their entirety we would lose up to half a million jobs in the supply chain, with beef production in the likes of Ireland and France being wiped out and poultry production disappearing altogether?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I apologise sincerely to the Commissioner that, as the debate has run several hours late and I have a plane that will not wait, I will have to listen to his answers on the Internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a risk that the failure at the WTO ministerial meeting last week to bring members closer to trade deals represents another step towards the final betrayal of the very idea of a Development Round. Some have even said that the meeting was counterproductive, with an atmosphere even more difficult than before, but perhaps the silver lining is that developing countries are united in insisting that rich countries put development at the heart of the process as a matter of course and deliver on their extremely long-standing promises.</p>
<p class="contents">More than two thirds of the WTO membership – developing and least-developed countries – declared that they were prepared to make a deal, but that industrial countries have to make the greatest contribution to show real leadership. I am glad the EU signalled that it was prepared to move closer to the G20 position, particularly by lowering domestic support, but there are still loopholes in the EU offer that would undermine the potential of a true development deal. The US offer is of course still far removed from what is necessary to stop dumping and protect food security.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the special and differential treatment in agriculture, the Development Box, it is not clear whether the Commission will support the G33 request for a significant percentage of products to be covered in order to guarantee food security. I would be grateful if Commissioner Mandelson could set out the EU position and hopefully distinguish it from the extremely damaging proposals from the US.</p>
<p class="contents">On NAMA, the Commission is still demanding too much extreme liberalisation, which will threaten the very survival of some developing countries’ local manufacturing and it is hardly in the spirit of the Development Round to demand action on applied tariff levels rather than, as usual, bound tariff levels.</p>
<p class="contents">It looks very unlikely that we will have an agreement in July and the timetable is too hurried. We should have a reflection period on the reasons for the failure of the Doha Round. We must learn lessons from this and ensure things are better processed through a much reformed WTO and obtain a clear understanding of the role of trade and delivering sustainable development. Perhaps in that way we can devise a Development Round generally worthy of the name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis within the WTO makes it more likely that the institution will no longer be able to act as anything more than an arbitrator and will no longer be able to take the initiative in proposing new rules, with the consequent threat of world trade being once more in thrall to innumerable bilateral agreements. I have three questions I would like to put to Commissioner Mandelson.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, are all the parties involved in the trade talks fully aware of just how urgent it is that the Doha round be brought to a good conclusion? My second question follows on from the first and it is this: what is the Commissioner’s view as regards the role of the United States and the G-20, and to what degree, Commissioner, do you think they are willing to take action? My third question is the most urgent. Is the Commission clear in its own mind about what it will do if the Doha round fails, and what sort of agenda does it have prepared for that eventuality?</p>
<p class="contents">I want to put to the Commission two proposals as regards this trade agenda. Above all else, the way ahead through multilateral agreements must be kept open for as long as possible. Bilateral agreements always present world trade with innumerable sorts of trade rules that make it less manageable and less effective. On top of that, they also present the threat of a new economic protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">My second proposal has to do with the role of developing countries, which must not be allowed to fall victim to the power of any future bilateral agreements. The Commission must offer such countries technical support in order that they may not, in negotiations, lose out to the big ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could not be there, but they did express their thanks for the way he kept them informed.</p>
<p class="contents">I got the impression from your address, Commissioner – which I thought was quite frank – that, to choose my words carefully – and I could have used stronger words – you were pretty fed up with the way the US was involved in the negotiations. In fact, it would appear that it was pretty intransigent. Although you cannot always believe what you read in the press, according to a press release you had asked the US trade representative, Susan Schwab, what she would be able to offer if the EU were to give the US everything it wanted on market access. Apparently she was unable to answer that. I wonder whether the US has a mandate. When we were in Hong Kong, Rob Portman seemed never to be able to negotiate. Whenever I listened to him, there was a particular problem with West African cotton. Certainly when producers lobbied him in Hong Kong he got very upset and seemed not to be able to make any comment. That was not a big issue for the United States and not a big issue in terms of trade, but it was very important.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the fallback position if nothing happens in the next month in the negotiations? Where do we go? What is the situation?</p>
<p class="contents">On a minor point, Mrs Harkin mentioned agriculture. What is the position? There is a huge worry, certainly in the United Kingdom and, I am sure, across Europe about hormone beef coming into the European Union under a trade negotiation with the US. Is there a real risk that might happen, or can we stop it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that a successful round depends on tackling agriculture. With up to 85% of their populations living in rural areas it is not surprising that the world’s poorest countries will judge any package on the basis of its impact on their farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find more baffling, frankly even inexplicable, is the notion that the talks could flounder on the US and to a lesser extent the EU position on agriculture. Agriculture represents only 2% of our wealth, therefore it seems perverse to make this a sticking point when we have so much to gain from improved non-market agricultural access and in particular from services liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of the Doha round, the EU has undergone substantial CAP reform. In Hong Kong we offered to end agricultural export subsidies by 2013; our Everything but Arms scheme offers duty-free access for products from the poorest countries. While I believe we can and should go further and I commend the Commissioner for his flexibility, particularly the flexibility he showed in Geneva, this is a flexibility that is sadly lacking in our negotiating and trading partners.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to ask the Commissioner, given his extensive contacts with other negotiators, is whether he can tell this House what sort of package he believes it is necessary for the United States to put on the table in order to break this log-jam.</p>
<p class="contents">Susan Schwab has indicated that she remains committed to a successful outcome. What does she need to bring to the table to show that the US is prepared to put its farm subsidies where its mouth is? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been no noticeable gains for least-developed nations. There have been noticeable losses to countries like Mauritius, which now run the risk of being relegated to the category of poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There have also been major losses for Irish agriculture. Recently a farmer – who is a third-generation sheep farmer – took me to see his last flock of sheep. In our once flourishing sugar industry, the lights have been switched off and the door closed in our last factory. Although I would like to see some tangible progress for the poorest nations, I suppose I should be grateful that in this latest round of talks no more Irish agriculture has been given away.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the Commissioner needs to find leverage to shift the US position, I suggest that he works to get GM crops categorised separately from their natural equivalents. This would give us and the least-developed countries a distinct advantage over the US, which would find it hard to separate GM crops and natural equivalents. When the Commissioner does that, would he also again talk to Commissioner Fischer Boel about allowing countries in Europe to have GM-free status? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was very rewarding and I think that we cooperated very well. There is an intrinsic value in us obtaining a new WTO agreement. Doing so requires confidence, both in the WTO and in multilateralism itself. It is, after all, the only system that has delivered real liberalisations of world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, however, that we are right to demand more than just an agreement from all the parties. We deserve an ambitious agreement, an agreement that provides greater market access for both agricultural products and industrial goods for everyone, both in industrialised countries and in developing countries, and one that does not leave out services. This is a crucial matter if poor countries are to develop, but also if our own European companies are to have access to new markets. In the long term, no one would gain from a ‘Doha light’ deal or a complete failure of the Doha Round. I therefore do not believe that there is any justification for the entrenched positions that we see many of the parties taking up at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to see the problems with the negotiations. The economic reality should be enough to convince all the parties to make that little bit of extra effort, particularly the EU-Brazil-USA triangle that was so much in the spotlight over the weekend in Geneva. All of these countries have strong practical reasons to take a further step. In the USA, for example, even the most dogmatic advocates of agricultural protectionism should be able to see that it is better to give up their agricultural subsidies in the course of the negotiations and receive market access to key regions in exchange, rather than to be forced to give them up by a dispute settlement body following a breakdown of the talks, and then receive nothing at all in exchange. The sugar panel that came down against us and made us reform our subsidies to sugar producers ought to have given us the same insight.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should also understand that it is absurd to fail to secure much more important market openings for industrial goods and services as a result of clinging on to an agricultural subsidy that we all know is fundamentally untenable. It is therefore pleasing that the Commission appears to have come closer to meeting the demand from the G20, the group of advanced developing countries, to reduce the high levels of customs duties on agricultural products. This is crucial if we are to salvage the prospects of achieving an agreement. We must now ensure that we apply a flexible approach only in connection with genuinely vulnerable products and not in order to satisfy those special interests with the loudest voices. If anyone should understand the importance of trade without customs and barriers then it should be us, here in Europe. We, who see the benefit of it every day through the internal market.</p>

As previous speakers have said, there was daily contact with Mr Mandelson and Mr Fisher Boel. This ensured that there was a constant flow of information, which meant that the MEPs could achieve more. The second is the image of the EU as a proactive bloc that is prepared to negotiate, in contrast with other partners, in particular the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the downside, there is no doubt that the negotiations did not achieve a great deal, which is bad for the world and for Europe. In Europe we need to strengthen competitiveness, growth and employment. To this end, we need to ensure effective access for industrial companies – non-agricultural market access (NAMA) – and for more dynamic services to markets; we need to guarantee respect for intellectual property and to negotiate an environmental and social level playing field that regulates international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one or two questions. Firstly, what is Europe's actual ability to find a solution, even a partial one, to these problems in the Doha round? Secondly, if, as we expect, an agreement is not reached in July, what strategy will the EU adopt? </p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned a new set of proposals in September. Can you give us some details about that? </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PT)</span> Third question; is the great difficulty in achieving results at the current Doha Round down to routine problems or does the multilateral model of the worldwide harmonisation of trade, which I am personally in favour of, need to be completely revamped and perhaps supplemented? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increased trade and prosperity means a reduction in migration, a more stable society and peace. The Third World needs as big a share of world trade as anyone else, but the current regime of tariffs and subsidies stifles it. Why not drop barriers against the Third World in return for domestic, legal and infrastructural progress?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will not look again at tariffs before 2013 and precious time will be lost. Now we come to the issue of globalisation. Why on earth are such high tariffs being put on shoes from China? Are we afraid of China’s massive population out-producing Europe? We must think again; trade is a two way thing. Buying from China means that 500 million Europeans will get an entry into a market of 1.3 billion Chinese. That is an enormous opportunity for European producers.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would urge the Commissioner to please have the courage and the daring to reduce tariffs and subsidies drastically and stimulate free trade worldwide. Let us not just talk about reducing poverty and making poverty history, but let us take real concrete steps to promote trade, which offers the only real solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has proved possible, once and for all, to pass the buck to the United States; the European Union has at last managed to escape from its assigned role of stonewaller, and it is plain for all to see that the time has come for the others to make their moves. Another good thing is that the parties to the negotiations took their leave of each other at the weekend in an atmosphere of calm, rather than, as they did after Hong Kong, laying into each other at the tops of their voices, and that gives cause for hope in the coming weeks. One ought not realistically to be able to expect a result by June or a line to be drawn under it by then.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of things, though, will be important over the weeks to come. For a start, our economy needs markets to be really open, particularly in the emerging economies. Secondly, there must be no unilateral concessions where agriculture is concerned. Thirdly, not even in the next few weeks must there be any premature political deals. Fourthly, a bad result would be even worse than none at all, for it would be a disaster for our national economies if we were to offer across—the-board reductions in customs duties and subsidies in the agricultural sector or in NAMA without getting in return real improvements in market access for industrial products. Fifthly, it is absolutely vital that the European representatives to the G8 summit should raise the subject of the Doha round and put it at the top of the agenda there. It is vital to all the interested parties that this round should not fail, but should instead be able to yield gains in prosperity for all WTO members on the basis of clear and unambiguous results.</p>

I would like to thank those who have supported the Commission in its negotiating stance and its negotiating approach. It is never easy finally to judge precisely the best thing to do at the best time, but we do our best and I think it is true to say that amongst the key negotiating partners the EU has considerable support for the approach that we are taking. This is not as important as the support we have from our own side, from our own Member States and from the Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make one observation immediately. We have a number of interests in these negotiations – agricultural, non-agricultural, relating to services liberalisation and rules. Our job as negotiators is to get an outcome that is balanced across the range of those negotiating subjects. We will give in some places more than we will give in other places. There will be swings, there will be roundabouts, we will gain, and we will lose.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody can make a final judgement about what Europe will be able to gain from these talks until the very end – not simply when the key modalities are put in place, as I hope they will be this summer, but when all the other negotiations have taken place on the individual country schedules and when all the negotiations about rules have also been put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that those who are particularly concerned about agriculture in Europe understand and accept that we will not pay over the limits in agriculture for what we want elsewhere in the talks. We will do what is fair. We will do what is reasonable. We will do what is in our mandate as far as agriculture is concerned. That is clear to me. It should also be clear to our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, it is important to keep a sensible perspective in these negotiations. We must be careful not to devote such energy to protecting our defensive interests in agriculture in these negotiations that we fail to prioritise our offensive interests in non-agricultural market access and in services. There really must be a sense of proportion and balance as regards how we weigh the various economic and social interests that are at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the United States is concerned, let me just say this in response to one speech: I do not feel that, should the talks fail, we as European negotiators are in a race with the United States to see who can shift the blame most effectively to the other. I look to the United States as a genuine partner, as a country and an economy that shares some of our interests but at the same time places a different emphasis from us in various areas of these negotiations. We will not reach a successful conclusion unless the EU and the US work together as a team – not at the expense of other negotiating partners, not instead of sensible negotiations and links and agreements that we will have with our negotiating partners in various areas of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if at the end of the day the EU and the US are at loggerheads and simply cannot agree the ground on which they will stand together to bring these talks to a successful conclusion, then there will be no successful conclusion to these talks. We will lose from that, the United States will lose from that, the global economy will lose from that and in particular developing countries will lose from that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Members who have spoken, including those who have asked what my Plan B is if these talks fail. I am afraid I am not preparing for failure: I am going to continue to negotiate for success only, whether it be in relation to hormone beef, which is not part of these negotiations – we do not welcome US hormone-treated beef in the European Union for health reasons, not trade reasons – or in relation to GMOs, which again are not the subject of these talks and where our policy firstly has to be in line with the regulatory framework we adopted in the EU a few years ago and in line with WTO rules. It is this that governs our approach, rather than something I am negotiating in these talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that we – the Commission and Members of this Parliament – are able to cooperate in Geneva and elsewhere. I do not cooperate with this Parliament as an act of generosity on my part. There is nothing altruistic about this. The reason I cooperate is because I want the Members of the European Parliament there on these occasions. You give me valuable insights, you collect information and intelligence, you are able to tap different sources of opinion, which I do not always have easy access to, and you are also, on a good day, able to help us deliver a message to our negotiating partners. That is why I welcome Members of this Parliament being present and why I shall remain very firmly in cooperation with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
