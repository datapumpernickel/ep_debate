<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been disturbed to see renewed acts of violence in the Basque Country. The Commission agrees with the repeated and forceful statements that have been made condemning these loathesome acts of terrorism committed in the territory of the Member States of the European Union – in all Member States, but particularly in Spain. Terrorism represents one of the greatest challenges our societies face and is unacceptable, because of the indiscriminate violence that characterises it, and which particularly affects the civilian population. Terrorist attacks shock and sadden the entire European public and fully deserve to be rejected because Europe's citizens continue to express their unrelenting desire to share a peaceful future. The Commission believes that the solidarity shown by the other Member States can and must support the Spanish authorities’ fight against terrorism. The Commission therefore welcomes the step forward represented by the enshrinement in the Treaty of Amsterdam of the principle of solidarity in the fight against terrorism. Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union specifically mentions terrorism as one of the forms of crime to be prevented and fought at European level and one of the areas in which the European Union can bring added value to this fight.</p>
<p class="contents">The European dimension of the fight against terrorism is not, however, a recent concept. Some key acts of cooperation between the judicial systems and police services of at least two states, particularly on both sides of the French-Spanish border, have recently produced some good results in this fight against terrorism. For its part, the Commission is cooperating with the Member States and with Europol with the same aim. Similarly, in the framework of action by the Council of Europe and the United Nations, there are various appropriate international conventions against terrorism that have not yet been signed, but which are currently being negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these new attacks unfortunately show that these efforts are still not enough to eliminate terrorism. We must go further in terms of European cooperation. A few words on behalf of the Commission would be appropriate here, heartfelt words of respect for and in tribute to the victims of terrorist attacks, who have often been representatives of the people, whose legitimacy comes from the ballot box in democratic elections. I also wish to pay tribute to those who have fallen victim to terrorism because they are carrying out their professional duties out of a sense of duty as servants of the state and of the people. But I also wish to pay tribute to those arbitrary victims of terrorism, the anonymous members of the public who refuse to live under the blackmail of fear. The finest tribute that I can pay is exactly this, to prove that we in the European institutions are able to contribute to this collective effort on the part of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam, as I have already stated, enables the European Union to make this contribution. Immediately following its entry into force, therefore, the Heads of State and Government meeting at the Tampere European Council included terrorism in their overall approach to combating all forms of crime. Clear political commitments were given, such as the commitment to set up joint investigation teams, which, in my view, represent the most effective instrument for fighting terrorism at its very roots. Europol, whose mandate expressly covers terrorism, must also give its support to this joint action and participate in these joint investigation teams. The greater operational capacity Europol has, the more effective its support will be. Although it is true that in many cases bilateral cooperation between police forces is an essential instrument for combating terrorism, it is no less true that the need to establish the link between some terrorist acts and other forms of organised crime, in its methods, in its networks of activity and even in its sources of financing, requires a multilateral, not just a bilateral vision of the phenomenon of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, instruments for judicial cooperation, specifically those designed to prevent criminals from benefiting from and taking advantage of the differences in legislation across Europe, will also enable us to reduce, or even, one day, to eliminate all the obstacles that are raised when an application is made to extradite terrorists from one European Union country to another to stand trial. The path we must take is quite clear, as it was decided in Tampere that formal extradition proceedings between Member States for those who have actually been sentenced must in future be abolished. The principle of mutual recognition of judgments should also apply to final judgments, but also to judgments prior to the trial stage itself. A first objective would therefore be to guarantee that capture orders for the purpose of a trial are implemented, bearing in mind the gravity of the crimes we are talking about, in the event that several warrants are served on the same person.</p>
<p class="contents">Our institutional partners now have the responsibility of ensuring that these guidelines, which have already been accepted at political level, are translated more rapidly into laws and into action. Various essential actions for stepping up the fight against terrorism are already included in the scoreboard for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. I feel certain that these actions, particularly the commitment given by the Heads of State and Government to the effect that terrorism is one of the forms of crime on which the European institutions will have to adopt common definitions, charges and sanctions, will rapidly be given substance in order to send out a clear message that terrorist acts will not be protected by the legislation of any Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to reiterate the Commission’s commitment to promoting more effective European action against terrorism, using all the means made available to it under the treaties, whether these terrorist acts take place in Spain or in any other Member State, as I have just been informed has happened tonight in the United Kingdom. In democratic societies such as ours, terrorism cannot take shelter behind any supposedly political justification. Terrorism, it must be said, is a dead end and the fact that it has fortunately disappeared from other European countries gives us cause for hope that sooner or later it will also be eliminated in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to governments to demonstrate to the public in their countries the absurdity of terrorism and to attack it root and branch by means of a multifaceted intervention strategy. I am sure that democratic societies, of which we are proud to belong, will win this battle, as long as we do not abdicate our democratic values and demonstrate that democracy is a powerful system for fighting terrorism and therefore make both preventive policies and the repression of terrorist acts more effective. This is clearly what Spain is doing and is also what the Commission is committed to doing in the fields in which it has competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is an area of freedom which we all wish to strengthen. Hence, all terrorist attacks are not just attacks on democracy and the rule of law but they also prevent Europe’s citizens from enjoying the freedom that we all desire. Our commitment and our collective efforts must therefore be directed towards enabling everyone to fully enjoy this freedom. Freedom must not be surrendered to blackmail or to fear, because only in freedom can human dignity be experienced.</p>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, since the first democratic elections took place in Spain in 1977, the Basque Country has emerged as the European region with the highest degree of self-government. Since then, the Basque people have had the opportunity, on six occasions, to elect the representatives for their autonomous parliament and violent and radical nationalism has never won the democratic support of the Basque people at the polls.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since our Constitution was approved, enshrining the democratic rights of the people of Spain, ETA has killed 804 people in my country and left over 2000 widows and orphans all over Spain, mainly in the Basque Country. Their victims were men and women from all walks of life, including, of course, those who dedicated part of their lives to fighting the dictatorship. As part of the struggle to banish fear, these days in the Basque Country and in the rest of Spain there is a popular, civic and peaceful backlash against the tyranny of murderous terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, ladies and gentlemen, this debate must take up and broaden this popular call and encourage the people of Europe to work together to create a great pact for freedom. We must be able to make the people of our countries of origin realise that the fundamental principles on which our common coexistence rests are threatened whenever anyone, in any part of Europe, is killed because of their beliefs. Only the united stand taken by democrats can ensure that the perpetrators of violence are marginalised as well as those who, owing to the permissiveness generated in our democracies, protect, induce, justify or tolerate terrorist acts of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope my message is clear. We all doubtless agree that dialogue is a decisive factor in the democratic process. There is only one exception to this golden rule and that exception is also an essential component of democratic systems. In a democracy, ladies and gentlemen, the voice of those who are intent on destroying it and who use criminal methods to achieve their ends must be silenced by the law, by the Rule of Law. Democracy must never bow to those who at the same time, and this is something I stress, at the same time, insist on holding it to ransom, gun in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced of the personal and political commitment of Commissioner Vitorino and the College of Commissioners to this undertaking, something that they have demonstrated on several occasions. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to use his exclusive powers of legislative initiative to propose new measures to enable us to make progress as regards European cooperation which, as you yourself pointed out, is still insufficient. One of the most effective measures in the fight against terrorism is in fact the European arrest warrant, which would mean that terrorists served their sentences in the country where they committed their most heinous crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, by sparing a thought for those Europeans most affected by fear, in other words, the victims of terrorism and their families. Today, thanks to this debate, they are a little less alone.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Díez González (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, last Thursday while we were presenting a written declaration to the Parliament register through which we sought a direct and active commitment from the European Parliament in the fight against ETA terrorism, this criminal organisation attempted to kill José Ramón Recalde. Recalde, a 70-year-old socialist, has dedicated his life to defending democracy and freedom. This is something he pursued as a teacher in San Sebastian in the turbulent 1960s, when he became, in the eyes of his students, an example of intellectual rigour and human decency. During the Franco years he was also founder of the first ‘ikastolas’ – schools in which the Basque language is taught – and later combined his teaching role with a position in two of the autonomous coalition governments with the nationalists, as Minister of Education and Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, his past life as a freedom fighter, defender of understanding and tolerance is what has made him a prime target for ETA, which serves as one more example of the obscene behaviour of this terrorist group. What is more, ladies and gentlemen, the damage inflicted on us by ETA goes beyond damage to our coexistence, to the attacks on our freedom and on our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorists and their accomplices have projected a completely distorted image of my country, its people and history. Therefore – to paraphrase the Basque philosopher Savater – I hope you do not mind if I take this opportunity to speak about the realities of the Basque country, to help you understand the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I was born 48 years ago in Euskadi, where I have lived all my life. Euskadi is a beautiful country that is modern, open, full of kind people and tolerant. It is a hybrid and diverse country, and this is our greatest asset. The young people who live there are not so different to the young people of Germany, Belgium or Italy. They speak Spanish, Euskera, English, German and Italian. They surf the net. They participate actively in peaceful organisations and organisations dedicated to development cooperation, sexual equality, ecology and the environment. Only a few young Basque people choose to wear black hoods. The majority paint their hands white to defend their freedom in peaceful street demonstrations. These people, unlike those of my generation, were born into a democracy, but unlike their young counterparts in the rest of the European Union, they still have to defend their freedom and that of others against the terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, ETA has spent more than 20 years killing in a campaign against democracy. Yes, it was over 20 years ago that Spain regained its democracy and with it we Basques reclaimed our right to self-government: we voted in favour of it in a referendum in 1979. But before that, in 1977, there was a general amnesty in Spain and all political prisoners, among them all members of ETA that had been imprisoned during the Franco years, were freed. Since 1977, however, ETA has continued to kill, murdering hundreds of victims – 19 of whom were children between the ages of 2 and 16. Those murdered have ranged from the police to the military, town councillors, businessmen, journalists, teachers, pacifists, taxi drivers, shopkeepers and bicycle sellers. These, ladies and gentlemen, are the kind of people who have fallen victim to ETA.</p>
<p class="contents">In some parts of the Basque Country ETA and its support network are pushing for the ethnic cleansing of those of us that do not espouse nationalist political opinions, depriving us of our status as Basque citizens and chasing us from our towns, forcing us to remain silent.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always ready to talk to those who play by the rules of the democratic game. All ideas can be defended through the spoken word. Nothing is set in stone. Everything is subject to change, but we shall never accept terrorism as an instrument for changing our will. Those who kill in the belief that this approach will work must lose all hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy and human rights are the very <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> of the European Union. This is why whenever fascist and totalitarian acts committed by ETA in one part of Europe strip us of our freedom, people elsewhere in Europe must feel that our freedom, everyone’s freedom – whatever a person’s nationality, language, culture or religion – is under threat.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President asked the speaker to conclude)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I simply wanted to say that the people of the Basque Country are normal, ordinary people, who are anxious to find a way out of this impasse, and be free to walk around our towns without watching our backs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our young people do not want to have to demonstrate in the streets and paint their hands white. We simply want to live in peace and defend our freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will all show your active solidarity and help us be like the other citizens of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paul,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States of the European Union are unanimous in condemning terrorism, whatever the motives of the groups of criminals carrying out terrorist attacks, and so the Council of the European Union is just as firm in its condemnation of all the forms of terrorism carried out on European territory. I should like to point out that at the Summit of the Heads of State and Government which was held on 19 and 20 June this year in Santa Maria da Feira, in Portugal, the Council expressed its outrage at the tragic events related to terrorism in Europe and vigorously reaffirmed its commitment to continuing to fight terrorism at European level and to stepping up and intensifying cooperation between Member States in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Since France currently holds the Council Presidency, at this point I would particularly like to express our solidarity in the face of the terrorism in Spain, which is the most deadly in Europe at the present time. Clearly, the European Union cannot possibly tolerate Spanish terrorists using the construction of Europe as an alibi in order to justify their claims. In no instance can violent nationalism be compatible with the ideals of the European Union. Combating all forms of terrorism is therefore a priority for the European Union in order to achieve the area of freedom, security and justice set as a goal by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere Summit in October 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, alongside the multilateral cooperation implemented by the European Union bodies, there is also particularly effective bilateral cooperation, and we have recently seen the results of French and Spanish operational cooperation. It is the role and the responsibility of the European Union in combating terrorism in general, and therefore also terrorism in Spain, which I wished to discuss this morning in my capacity as co-chairman, together with Elisabeth Guigou, the French Minister of Justice, of the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me briefly to outline the story so far, the cooperation between the Member States of the European Union on internal security originated in 1976, at the time of the Trevi groups. These informal groups, which met every six months, were, from the outset, a reflection of the determination to have police cooperation in a number of areas, including on terrorism, which was of particular concern to the members of the Trevi I group.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation in police matters, an idea developed at the Trevi Conference, led to the establishment of a network of liaison officers. The implementation of this network, undoubtedly the most effective cooperative network, was the result of the action programme adopted in Dublin in June 1990 by the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the twelve Member States at that time. It involves exchanges of information between experts posted in specialised departments in the various Member States. These liaison officers are responsible for exchanging information, but also for supporting the relevant departments in an advisory role. I think it is safe to say by now that this network of liaison officers has very clearly demonstrated its effectiveness by facilitating the smooth running of police inquiries in real time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of cooperation on justice and home affairs, a specific counter-terrorism working group was also established, subsequently, by the Maastricht Treaty. This Experts Group on terrorism was confirmed by the Treaty of Amsterdam, clearly demonstrating the need for a body within which the representatives of the fifteen Member States have the opportunity to meet to exchange views and cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of this group was what led the Council to adopt two important decisions which I would like to remind you of. In 1996, the Council adopted a Joint Action establishing a European Directory of specialised counter-terrorist competences, skills and expertise, and stipulating that it be maintained. Moreover, at the end of 1999, the Council adopted a recommendation on cooperation in combating the financing of terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also at this point mention the role played by the European Police Office, Europol, in combating terrorism. From the outset, the Convention of 26 July 1995 establishing the European Police Office stipulated that this police cooperation body would be competent to deal with 'crimes committed or likely to be committed in the course of terrorist activities against life, limb, personal freedom or property'. The initial wording of the Convention stipulated that Europol’s mandate would be extended to terrorism within two years at the latest of the Convention’s entry into force, which was on 1 October 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there is a Europol department dedicated to combating terrorism. This was a request from Spain and so, naturally, a leading official from Spain was given the job of managing that department. In view of the criminal activity undertaken at that time by some terrorist groups, the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which met on 28 and 29 May 1998, took the decision to authorise Europol to bring forward its counter-terrorism activities and have them begin on 1 January 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot, of course, fail to mention the current priorities of the French Presidency of the European Union in the area we are discussing this morning. In particular, the French Presidency wishes to improve and intensify the cooperation between Member States, but also to extend this cooperation yet further to include the candidate countries. This is both legal and police cooperation, which will no doubt one day lead to the harmonisation or unification of criminal charging systems. The Spanish Government, for example, would like a European arrest warrant to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the priorities of the French Presidency I should particularly like to mention the initiative to establish a programme of information and measures to be undertaken in order to prepare for the accession of the candidate countries to the European Union. This approach is intended to enable us to increase our knowledge of their counter-terrorism organisations and to increase awareness in countries which do not <span class="italic">a priori</span> have any specific experience in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to draw up an accurate picture of the terrorism situation within the European Union, and this is the second priority of our presidency, we wished to continue the practice of providing an opportunity at each meeting of the working group of exchanging information on recent developments in terrorism in each of the States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is this system, with a combination of bilateral and multilateral cooperation, which very recently, in fact just a few days ago, made it possible to achieve some remarkable successes in the fight against terrorism in Spain.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Esteve (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I was probably the first to hear about the terrorist attack this morning at 7.40, so I have known about it for a while now. The attack happened in Catalonia about three or four kilometres from my house and it appears that the situation is worsening since, even though ETA have already killed more than 800 people, they have committed yet another atrocity, even as we speak.</p>
<p class="contents">No political objective justifies the use of violence. We can but express our wholehearted condemnation of terrorism and particularly at a time when the terrorists seem so intent on destroying us. We must therefore, once again, strongly reiterate our firm and cooperative position as the Commissioner said, in support of a strong democracy, given that terrorism constitutes a direct threat to our core values. We should like to express our solidarity with those who have been affected and also, in particular, our hope for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In the wake of the latest atrocity, the debate is especially difficult for this Member, and this is something I commented on to four of the five people that signed the declaration against terrorism in Spain. I pointed out to two of them that the signing of the declaration may prove difficult for some due to the content of one of the paragraphs, the second paragraph in fact. This paragraph rejects dialogue with any group that tolerates terrorism or that is involved in it. The reason I spoke to the authors of the text is that I think they need to find a formula on which everyone agrees. One might wonder why the second paragraph of the text as it stands is proving so difficult to sign. The reason is because it calls into question the culture of peace and the culture of dialogue. What is more, if we renounce dialogue the Northern Ireland peace process would not be possible, the Middle East peace process would not be possible and, the Member of the European Parliament, Mr John Hume, would not have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and I think it is important his work receives recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">If ETA does not give up its weapons, we shall not give up ours. If ETA refuses to renounce violence, we shall refuse to renounce the law and dialogue, which are our weapons. We have no others. This is why I strongly urge those that presented the declaration – as I have done so in private and do so now publicly – to do all they can to enable us to sign it, because any position that is adopted on terrorism requires universal backing. On the other hand, if this declaration is supposed to stem from the 1997 declaration adopted by Parliament, which spoke of dialogue in positive terms, it would seem strange not to have recourse to it, and in particular, to the eighth paragraph in which Parliament considers dialogue in positive terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we should all be in a position to sign the declaration. Nothing justifies the use of terrorism and nothing justifies the failure of democratic forces to adopt a united front in the face of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We regret that unequivocal repudiations and constructive proposals do not, however, go hand in hand, as proved by the declaration that has already been discussed and which has been presented by several groups to the exclusion of others and without open debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We naturally respect the freedom of individuals and political groups to make statements, but forcing us to reject dialogue, and for a large number of reasons, is something we cannot accept. In the first place, this is because we, like Mo Mowlam, firmly believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve violent conflicts in whatever part of the world, and, in the second place, because we cannot be inconsistent with declarations made by Parliament on previous occasions, a few of which I shall mention here. A few days ago in Strasbourg, President Nicole Fontaine herself made reference to all of the democrats of Europe, men and women alike, and especially the Basque Country in Spain, which, in her view, continues to believe in political dialogue, despite the climate of terror that exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Where would Lionel Jospin, François Bayrou or our fellow Member of the European Parliament and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, John Hume, as well as all those in favour of the Irish peace process be if they accepted proposals that condemned dialogue? Where would Commissioner Reding stand as a result? I shall not quote from the text, but the Commissioner’s report on terrorism presented to Parliament in 1997 is there for consultation. When we talk about a serious European conflict we cannot consider it lightly and simply content ourselves with rhetorical and repeated statements, without attacking the root causes underlying all of these problems and without trying, together, to find a solution. Parliament needs to be in a position to promote initiatives that will put an end to this cruel violence afflicting the Basque Country, and which will help find new paths of dialogue, especially between the Basque democratic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although all groups, including ours, must be self-critical, it is now time we set to work and, above all, attempted to combat such a serious problem as terrorism from solid foundations, the maximum consensus possible and, of course, in the knowledge that dialogue has been, is and will always be the most valued method for achieving peace and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">We could have presented an alternative text here, but this would have been a serious mistake because in our view, resolving a matter as serious and important as this requires us to do everything that we can, except to put forward proposals that divide Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, if you will, to make a small personal confession. Thirty years ago at the height of the Franco dictatorship in 1970, I was in prison for championing freedoms and at that time I was against ETA. Like any human of integrity and intelligence, I am prepared to learn, but let me tell you this; I do not accept lessons in how to stand firm against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by recalling the words of Jorge Luís Borges when he wrote “Around 500 years before the Christian era, the greatest thing to happen in the history of the world occurred in Greece – the discovery of dialogue. Faith, certainty, dogmas, anathemas, prayers, prohibitions, orders, taboos, tyrannies, wars and glories overwhelmed the order of things. Out of this, some Greeks acquired – we shall never know how – the singular habit of conversing.”</p>
<p class="contents">Without those Greeks, Western culture would be inconceivable. If only today we were able to hold on to that great value of global culture that is dialogue, without prejudice to the greatest strength of our democratic convictions and the outright rejection of terrorism, and do so despite the latest painful, sad and abhorrent murder, even during the most difficult times and in the face of our most stubborn and murderous enemies.</p>

<p class="contents">Today is pointless already, after all that we have heard about the significance of ETA terrorism, its devastating effects on the population, its outright assault on the democratic values enshrined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and in the Statute of Guernica, that cost the countless efforts and sacrifices of the Basque and Spanish people as a whole to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard from those who fought against the Franco dictatorship, who are present today and are to be commended, but there are others, now dead, who no longer have a voice and can no longer participate in political dialogue. This is why the issue must be clarified here today, and why I must respond to the various interpretations of what constitutes political dialogue. Quite clearly, over and above natural political differences political dialogue must exist, a political dialogue between people and organisations that respect and defend the values of democracy and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Political dialogue cannot be achieved when, with one hand, or at a given moment, people call for dialogue and with the other, they turn a pistol or a bomb on those with whom they are supposedly in talks.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">No one can be invited to join in this dialogue. Political dialogue should take place between democratic parties, whether they be nationalist or not, with Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya, with Convergència i Unió, with the PNV, with Eusko Alkartasuna, with Izquíerda Unida, with the PSOE, with the governing Partido Popular, and within the institutions, transparently and clearly, on behalf of the people and answering to all Spanish citizens. We cannot, however enter into the kind of dialogue that the proponents of violence are calling for, as that kind of dialogue is not permissible in a democratic and open society.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that problems and any political, economic and social contradictions can be resolved through dialogue and through decisions taken by democratic institutions. However, we must not use dialogue as a universal rhetorical remedy that is also open to those who perpetrate and advocate violence and to those who bemoan the deaths as though they were traffic accidents when they are in fact cruel murders committed against children and defenceless people, as in the name of democracy, this is unacceptable. I think these people should remain silent and I hope they hear my message and adopt a more moral approach to the problem, as opposed to violence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue cannot serve to cover up violence and terror, nor can it mean surrender in the face of crime. Political dialogue is only possible when the bombs cease to go off, the guns are silent and democratic values have been accepted. We wholeheartedly reject the call for dialogue and the meekness that both lead to dictatorships and concentration camps. We are, however, in favour of responsible and democratic dialogue in order to achieve peaceful coexistence and to strengthen democracy, which is so essential to us.</p>

The United Kingdom has suffered from terrorism for over 30 years. Indeed, there was another incident in London last night, and I offer our condolences to the latest victim of terrorism in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to defeat terrorists, it is essential that government should be unambiguous in the message that it sends out and that public opinion should be kept resolute. Terrorists should be given no hope of achieving their objectives by force, no comfort that they will avoid punishment for their awful crimes and no hiding-place.

All that violence does is deepen the divisions and make the problem much more difficult to resolve. Organisations which use violence, should be told very clearly that their claim to be acting to achieve human and civil rights for people is completely false, because their method undermines the most fundamental human right of all, the right to life.</p>
<p class="contents">The message we should send out is that there should be an absolute and complete end to violence. Following an absolute and complete end to violence, there can be dialogue and this dialogue should involve democratically elected representatives of all sections of the people. The objective of that dialogue would be an agreement that would enjoy the loyalty of all sections of the people.</p>
