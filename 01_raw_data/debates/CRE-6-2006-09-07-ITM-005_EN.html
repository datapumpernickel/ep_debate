<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nikolaos Sifunakis (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important day for me personally and, at the same time, for my colleagues and for the Committee on Culture and Education because, following an entire project lasting about one year, I have the pleasure today of presenting to plenary my report on the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions.</p>
<p class="contents">For centuries, with simple materials and means, people living in the countryside and islands of Europe, obeying the basic rules of the human scale and the mildness of the natural environment, have managed to create a man-made heritage of huge aesthetic value.</p>
<p class="contents">This humble heritage, the protection and promotion of which is not only a cultural obligation but also a development need, has in many countries of Europe, at the responsibility of the governments, been altered considerably as a result of social and technological developments, unbridled economic exploitation and overdevelopment, which has, on the one hand, altered the place and destroyed – especially on the small scale of the islands – the wonderful balance between the natural and man-made environment and, on the other hand, destroyed highly-productive farmland.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of my report is to formulate specific proposals for the protection, promotion and long-term management of this rich heritage in rural and island regions in Europe, for the benefit of the quality of life of all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposals contained in the report are directed at the European Union, the Member States, local and regional authorities and European citizens, who are called upon to take specific measures to maintain and promote it. Due to limited time, I shall comment on just a few of them:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Union needs to acquire a comprehensive cultural heritage strategy. This will be achieved provided that the European Commission, when preparing its legislative proposals, examines in detail the repercussions of the proposals on culture, on the cultural heritage and, most importantly, on the popular architectural heritage which artisans have created by hand over the centuries. In this way, action beneficial to the heritage will be integrated into every Union policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that Community programmes in the culture sector do not offer adequate funding, additional funds to maintain the heritage must be found, together with other Community resources: within the framework of the common agricultural policy, in the Structural Funds and in the LEADER, URBAN and INTERREG Community initiatives, which are to be incorporated in the next financial period into the new political cohesion and CAP financing instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, in using the Community funds, the Member States should encourage sustainable, alternative tourism, which can help to protect and promote the architectural heritage of communities, most of which have retained their physiognomy.</p>
<p class="contents">The 'Culture' programme, with its limited budget, has also given considerable support to cultural heritage projects, but has, nonetheless, excluded restoration projects.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are other actions which could be financed under the new 'Culture 2007' programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, within the framework of multiannual cooperation projects under the programme, a network could be created of important architectural communities in various Member States with a population of up to 1 000 inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">These communities will carry out activities of a cultural nature depending on the traditions of each area, in order to strengthen cooperation between important architectural and cultural communities in Europe and give them the facility to develop their local characteristics, habits, customs and traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above that, however, the European Commission is also called upon to create a new European institution for important small traditional communities, along the lines of that instituting the cultural capitals, whereby one or two interesting communities would be selected each year, in which restoration and renovation interventions would be carried out and cultural events would be held throughout the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the development of architecturally important communities in Europe as our criterion, we also propose that a new category of award be created within the framework of the 'European Union Cultural Heritage Prize' for the best overall restoration of a traditional community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the man-made environment of Europe, which consists of sub-sets of various architectural forms and eras, is changing considerably due to unbridled overdevelopment and the existence of incompatible structures which are out of tune with the particular historical and architectural characteristics of their locality.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Member States must provide incentives for the whole or partial demolition of such buildings; at the same time, projects which demonstrably destroy and alter important elements of the cultural heritage must not be supported from Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report also proposes the introduction in the European Union of a 'European Cultural Heritage Year', the purpose of which will be to raise the awareness of European citizens about the importance of the cultural heritage, irrespective of its European, national or local dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like in particular to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Culture, the experts who worked with me and, of course, my colleagues in the Committee on Culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report highlights concerns over the importance attached to cultural heritage. They are concerns which the Commission fully shares.</p>
<p class="contents">Much remains to be done in this area. However, the Commission’s involvement has already been demonstrated both through the present Culture 2000 Programme and through other European programmes and financial instruments. Several points raised in the report have already been taken into account by the Commission. However, it is a very helpful report, which gives us the opportunity to stress once more the need to use all the existing possibilities to protect natural and architectural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the Treaty, the Commission encourages Member States to use all the opportunities offered by European financial instruments – the structural funds, for example – for investment in cultural heritage projects. Such investments are clearly important means for the creation of new employment opportunities and for economic growth. They therefore contribute to regional development and regeneration.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the European Commission, and the services of my colleague Mr Figel' in particular, are monitoring all European programmes and ensuring that the financial instruments incorporate cultural aspects into their objectives. As a result, over the last few years, we have witnessed a marked improvement. I am very pleased at this development and could give you examples of Member States, such as Greece or Portugal, that have grasped the opportunities offered by Community support frameworks and have introduced operational programmes for cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also encourages cooperation between Member States in the field of culture and cultural heritage through the Culture 2000 Programme. In the near future, these efforts will continue through the newly proposed Culture Programme 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the sound cooperation between the three institutions – and I should like to take this opportunity to thank, again on behalf of Mr Figel', the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura – this new programme for 2007-2013 will hopefully be adopted before the end of the year. In this context, partnerships such as those proposed in the report could be considered for funding in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report also recognises, the European Commission is very active in its efforts to increase awareness of the importance of cultural heritage through actions such as the European Prize for Cultural Heritage and the joint action undertaken with the Council of Europe on European Heritage Days. In the future, we could consider ways of enlarging the scope and having the European Parliament’s concerns better reflected in these actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would stress that this report is being discussed at precisely the right time. We are at a juncture when our new culture programme is about to be adopted, when the Commission is reflecting on its actions for the coming years and when many points are up for discussion. This report will certainly be of major interest in that context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In addition to the cultural interests at stake, it must be highlighted that there is a human, social and economic interest agenda involved in taking these ideas seriously. The Sifunakis report does the right thing by proposing a range of political priorities in order to reach those goals. For example, a systematic survey and study of this heritage and the recognition of its variety and versatility, the creation of a legislative framework to guarantee its protection, incorporating incentives for the conservation of traditional buildings, financial assistance, the continuation of traditional activities such as farming and arts and crafts, the conservation of traditional professions and local know-how, the restoration of natural habitats and architecture, the training of craftsmen, the adoption of new methods and techniques, the promotion of initiatives as part of the framework of Community programmes aimed at creating a European heritage inventory, and, lastly, the promotion of all the tangible and intangible elements that make up this heritage. The document before us is an extremely broad tapestry, and covers many more points than I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Defending the heritage of rural and island areas in this way is also a means of reversing the trend towards the abandonment of many of the places concerned and of creating focal points for attracting jobs and generating wealth and sustainable development. The authorities in my country have emphasised that the policy of the heritage of the rural world should be based on three main axes: sustainable balance between the population and the surrounding area; integrated action, meaning genuine cooperation between the various levels of authority and the local populations; and constant dialogue with local people, interested parties who actually know their own needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the points mentioned have already been proposed by the Commission for the period 2007 to 2013 and it is hoped that a well-balanced policy on rural and island heritage can help to reverse current negative trends. The Krakow Charter of 2000 promotes principles that are entirely applicable in this area based on the plurality of values and the diversity of interests of heritage; for example, historic cities and settlements represent, within their context, a vital part of our universal heritage and should be viewed as a whole, with the structures, spaces and human factors normally present in the process of continuing evolution and change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even so, when discussing the protection of our cultural heritage, which focuses primarily on preserving the cultural achievements of the past, what should be borne in mind is that culture is a dynamic and diverse process, so, while cultural policy has to be concerned with the maintenance and conservation of our cultural heritage, it must also take responsibility for the creation of cultural networks for contemporary culture and artistic trends that serve as a basis for the cultural heritage of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that people’s awareness of the cultural treasures of their own country and of Europe be fostered, and a European Cultural Heritage Year will certainly be able to highlight a number of them and make them more aware of their importance. More use can and should be made of the resources that the European Union makes available – in the shape of the Structural Fund, URBAN, LEADER, INTERREG and so on – in the service of cultural heritage, but responsibility for this lies with the Member States, and it is they that need to be made aware of the fact that investments in cultural heritage have beneficial effects on the quality of life in the regions and, of course, on tourism. It is, then, with the interests of these in mind that we need to get to work.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not agree with is the way we are drawing very heavily on the budgets for Culture 2000, or its successor, Culture 2007, for the sum of EUR 400 million, spread over 27 countries and a period of seven years, does not provide sufficient scope for contemporary art alongside structural investment. What we should be using these resources for, though, is the raising of awareness through seminars and the award of research contracts, through clarifying the degree to which experience and information are being exchanged, and how matters stand in the other countries, as well as planning projects on the protection of the regions. That is what this programme can – and should – do.</p>
<p class="contents">We are urged to think of our cultural heritage as an indivisible whole, and that we can do, but it must, in future, go hand in hand with that which is contemporary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do nevertheless regard this report as important, in that it attempts to raise awareness of the diversity of European culture and of Europe’s cultural heritage. Anyone who has had the opportunity to travel through Europe, whether to islands such as Madeira, the Canaries, Cyprus or Malta, or to visit rural areas in Tuscany, Scotland, Latvia, Finland, Poland or Provence, knows the beauty and diversity of this European cultural heritage and how readily people can be persuaded to take a stand in its defence.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the defence of this cultural treasure is a matter of political obligation – and I am talking here not only about the making of policy at European level, with its various programmes, but about the national level too. I also think it very important that we should, in working for the cultural diversity of Europe, consider more than just the 2007 culture programme and understand this as a real horizontal task and as a network policy including also agricultural policy and structural policy, that we should make use of the various programmes such as URBAN, LEADER, and INTERREG, since it has to be made clear that this is not only an important task in terms of cultural policy, it also has to do with preparing people to do jobs – as restaurateurs, for example – and with new developments in rural areas. It is, then, in the best sense, a truly multifaceted policy for the various European programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To date, the main thrust of the efforts made by the European Union, including this House and the European Commission has been towards establishing a universal European culture – a culture for all. As yet nobody has succeeded in implementing this doctrine and nobody will, because cultures arises from the collection of values developed by people coming together to form national groups. Culture binds a nation together, but also serves to distinguish it from other nations through its beauty, richness, cultural individuality and traditions that bind a people together and which are often known as its heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union must therefore foster linguistic diversity, because language is the basis of culture, and also popular culture, which is the basis of national culture. In addition, we must protect the cultural monuments and spiritual values that are disappearing, including folklore, handicrafts and trades which are dying out as civilisation and technology advance and mass production takes over.</p>
<p class="contents">Preserving the richness of individual cultures along with the beauty of the landscape and human beings’ natural environment, provides an opportunity for the intellectual development of people and a better awareness of the world around us. It is an opportunity for understanding, mutual respect and natural integration through values, rather than through the clout of the dominant economic and cultural power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, much of my constituency, the East of England, fits the bill as a rural area. That is, of course, as long as some of the misguided, unsustainable development plans from Mr John Prescott, our Deputy Prime Minister, can be halted.</p>
<p class="contents">Great Britain is an island with its own extensive natural and architectural heritage. However, although at face value this report has noble intentions, it serves to threaten Britain’s heritage. The proposals in the report have the specific aim of subsuming Britain’s distinct and diverse culture into the federalist fairytale creation of a common European culture. Sadly, many MEPs see culture purely as a tool for promoting European integration and pursuing a delusional project called ‘a United States of Europe’. Why can people here not understand that there is so such thing as a common European culture, no common history and no common heritage, just as there is no common architecture or common language? Europe is a continent formed of unique nation-states with very different histories and heritage. That is what makes Europe so very interesting and attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to achieve this report’s declared ambition of convincing Europe’s citizens that they share the same culture would be through lies. That is what frightens me. Today’s political elite seems to have no qualms about such deception. We have seen successive British governments seemingly deliberately and successfully keeping the British public in the dark about ‘project Europe’. What must be recognised is that the European Union’s integration agenda is one of the greatest threats to the heritage of every country in Europe that we have seen for decades. Sadly, reports such as these cannot see their own great contradiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If anything, they do not understand some of the confusing mechanisms of European Union interventions, which are all too often intended just to regulate and to standardise.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cultural, natural and architectural heritage could perhaps be more appropriately spoken of as architecture, landscape, and historical and landscape assets, terms that together better describe the integration that can be sought in the synergy between the natural landscape and the human landscape. Even so, it certainly plays a vital part in spreading social, economic and environmental welfare, especially in those areas of our Europe where not just the landscape but also the socioeconomic and demographic fabric is vulnerable. I should also have liked a more precise clarification of the concept of small traditional communities: the term ‘traditional’ is too vague and might lead to a lack of differentiation in the way that resources and commitments are used.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural communities are not just part of our collective memory; they are the vital cradle of our values and the fount of social relations that are often considerably more balanced than those of urban communities, as well as being absolutely essential for safeguarding our culture and environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This cultural heritage is not only threatened, as the rapporteur warns us, but in a great many places in Europe its functional survival is in danger. In addition to measures for preserving and safeguarding landscape and cultures, the Union – together with the Member States – should draw up suitable policies to prevent rural depopulation, especially in mountainous regions. Otherwise, we risk having to put money into restoring abandoned architectural assemblages, painting old houses that will remain uninhabited, and mending cobbled streets that will no longer be trodden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Consequently, protecting and maintaining it is particularly important to the education of the new generation and respect for the European identity while, irrespective of its European dimension, its local dimension is a fundamental value for European citizens. We all know that the spotlights are turned towards the big cities where the most well-known monuments are to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is a fact that the European countryside, which accounts for 90% of European territory, is being damaged by desertion and economic stagnation. Special attention must therefore be given to protecting and promoting the natural and architectural cultural heritage of island and other rural regions of Europe, given that these areas retain a great many of their characteristics unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect for the traditional rural space and striking a balance between the populace and the environment, all the factors which come to play in the culture sector must ensure that the cultural heritage of Europe is maintained and developed and strengthen awareness-raising among citizens as to its importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The restoration and maintenance of forgotten monuments in the outer regions of the Member States could also contribute towards the development of rural tourism and, by extension, to boosting the population in the countryside.</p>

<p class="contents">Through the report, the European Parliament has expressed its concern for the architectural heritage of rural Europe. This is an important legacy, but unfortunately it is frequently unappreciated and forgotten. Today we are living in a rapidly-changing world. Rural areas that had changed little over the centuries, have undergone a drastic transformation in recent decades. Farming methods and implements have been transformed, the nature of farm work has changed radically, and rural architecture has also changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the1960s, the buildings in rural areas of Poland were mainly wooden. Then came a period of rapid redevelopment. The new houses may have been more comfortable, but they were not always more attractive than the old ones. Traditional rural architecture disappeared quickly, and very little of it remains today, which means there is all the more reason for us to make every effort to ensure this heritage is effectively preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sifunakis’ report emphasises the importance of these matters and indicates specific ways of supporting activities to preserve valuable European rural architecture. It is a step in the right direction and comes just in time, while there is still something left to preserve for future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One place in which we can find such security is in our intellectual, cultural and architectural heritage, and increased popular interest in this heritage, and increased awareness of it and respect for it, testify to that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is that respect that should lead us to prevent any recurrence of the sort of destruction – deliberate destruction – of this intellectual, cultural and architectural heritage that was seen during the inferno of two world wars in the course of the twentieth century, and such as was aimed for and planned in Eastern Europe under ‘really existing Socialism’, Stalinism and Communism, and is, lamentably, practised at the present time by the brutal modernism supported by the political Left.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that Europe’s historical and cultural heritage, in particular that of rural areas, must not be considered solely in economic terms, nor should it serve only the interests of tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is advisable to extend such projects as the ‘European Capital of Culture’ to rural areas. I regard Sibiu, formerly known as Hermannstadt, in Transylvania, about which there was an exhibition of photographs in this House yesterday, as an example of the degree to which the European Union can promote and support our cultural heritage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By destroying this heritage, a nation severs its ancestral ties and tears up its roots.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts to achieve ever greater inter–connectedness mean that areas of new growth in European cities are becoming increasingly alike. This is why it is extremely important for each nation to preserve those characteristics which give it its distinct identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, the most genuine cultural and natural heritage is to be found in rural regions. It needs maintenance; otherwise it becomes dilapidated and falls into disrepair. This is our greatest challenge because the restoration of listed buildings and rural core areas is a very expensive and time–consuming business. At the same time, however, the living conditions in these buildings are less than suitable for modern circumstances, which is why many owners see cultural heritage as a burden rather than a source of joy and pride. Similarly, our old crafts are disappearing because they cannot provide a source of income.</p>
<p class="contents">If we view cultural and natural heritage solely through the lens of money and profit, then all it brings us is financial loss. We need to continuously seek a balance between conservation and further development.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the proposal for the Year of European Cultural Heritage as it will raise awareness amongst our citizens of the importance of cultural heritage. But I also support the proposal for us to earmark funding from the structural funds for the preservation of natural and cultural heritage in smaller villages, because by doing so we will rekindle the interest of owners and local communities in restoration. They will then also see the opportunities for development and new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Pearls are small and hidden. Small communities, too, deserve an opportunity to receive incentives and funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to that report, we are able to hold an extremely interesting debate, because once again it emphasises something that I and many people here present consider to be absolutely crucial in the Union, particularly over recent years: at last, we are becoming aware of the impact on island regions of their island characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome today’s report’s special reference to the protection and promotion of the natural, architectural and cultural heritage of Europe’s island regions. In this regard, the fact that the rapporteur comes from the Island of Crete, cradle of Minoan civilisation, Europe’s oldest civilisation, and that I come from the Balearic Islands, the location of the Naveta des Tudons, also considered to be Europe’s oldest example of building, from around 1 500 B.C., makes us both particularly sensitive to the need to encourage the European Union to adopt measures to protect and revive Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the Government of the Balearic Islands is working on drawing up and implementing policies of sustainable development based on the convergence of the objectives of sustainability and competitiveness of tourism activities and, in particular, on safeguarding and improving natural, architectural and cultural heritage. That is the direction we must take, which would involve a civil society sensitive to the particular fragility of the island regions and with a high degree of environmental awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a good point from which, as the report advocates, to begin immediately to share and exchange experiences in this important field of the protection of European heritage, a subject of huge importance since it does not only involve human beings, but is also an important element of the historic development and identity of the regions of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These differences, in contrast to the ever-growing globalisation of culture, form the real underlying wealth of our common heritage. The cradle of this heritage lies in our island and rural areas, with their traditions, their architecture, their local crafts and the beauty of their natural and human landscapes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a priority to protect this vast heritage and to prepare a plan for local development aimed at implementing and encouraging the enhancement of culture and environmental resources, to make them a tool for growth in our currently struggling economy. That means first of all improving overall conditions in the countryside, including not only restoring and preserving architecture from both a monumental and a landscape point of view, but also taking into consideration the people who live in and share the reality of small rural villages.</p>
<p class="contents">That means combating the rural exodus; providing incentives for youth training; rescuing local crafts and traditional farming practices; giving a boost to old trades and new professionalism, including by funding the development and use of new technologies; and ensuring that the landscape is maintained, not only by preserving green areas but, above all, by using local tree and plant species so as not to change the culture of the place.</p>
<p class="contents">The people who live in these areas must be provided with all the means necessary to be able to carry on their traditions in their towns, villages or islands. The programmes designed for these purposes must be strengthened and enhanced. The EU’s global cultural heritage strategy needs to become a real cross-cutting element in other policies, just as environmental sustainability is, and all policies need to be integrated together in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that a balanced, rational, consistent, coordinated and, above all, more effective use of resources, including at a financial level, will enable us to overcome this two-pronged challenge. Safeguarding the local and regional cultural heritage requires us to promote balanced socioeconomic development in the rural world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to go back over just two points: that of the funding of the Culture 2000 project and that of the proposal, put forward specifically by the rapporteur, to make 2009 the European Cultural Heritage Year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, as you know far better than I do, the Culture 2000 project, which had a budget of EUR 167 million, is now due to be allocated EUR 400 million. The budget has thus been substantially increased thanks to the contribution and the political support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second issue concerning the European year, the Commission is taking the proposal made very seriously, and we will assess it in the context of our objectives and priority plans for the next few years. This proposal deserves to be carefully analysed. I also wish to take advantage of this opportunity to point out to you that my colleague, Mr Figel', recently made an important proposal aimed at making 2008 the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a proposal that the Commission has adopted. I hope that the opinion to be issued by Parliament will be along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, as I stated, I shall inform Mr Figel' of the outcome of this debate, in a spirit of constructive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This notwithstanding, many political solutions for rural areas fail to consider their specific features and real needs adequately. For example, the countryside accounts for 85% of Slovakia’s territory and is home to 48% of the population. However, young people are tending to leave the countryside, rural population density has dwindled, our cultural heritage is threatened and high unemployment is a major concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider this report very topical, as it analyses the current situation and seeks to identify solutions that would support the rural areas and islands of Europe. It also addresses the future of small traditional communities with populations of less than 1 000. It focuses on aid for micro-enterprises, young farmers, traditional handicrafts and trades, local customs and traditions, which will help assure job creation and a better and more attractive life in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural heritage needs greater attention and, especially, more funding. The EU should introduce a comprehensive approach to sustaining cultural heritage, ensuring that provisions on aid are included in all policies. I welcome the ‘European Heritage Days’ initiative and the exchange of experience in this field through international conferences.</p>

With the little available resources and an enormous architectural and cultural heritage it is impossible to preserve same using only our resources. This is why we have to look to the EU to come to our aid. Few know that the earliest free standing buildings in the world have been found in Malta. Notwithstanding, they need immediate attention. Perhaps the most impressive temple complex Ggantija in Gozo is in dire need of immediate professional attention. Valletta, one of the most beautiful cultural capitals in Europe, is still in a disastrous state. Fifty years have passed since the end of World War II yet the capital is still war-scarred – in particular the ruins of the once magnificent Opera House. I appeal to the German and Italian governments to make a gesture of goodwill by rebuilding the Opera House which was destroyed through aerial bombings thus enhancing Valletta architecturally and contributing to its cultural heritage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
