<p>(DE)The coordination of social security systems and the transferability of pensions entitlements are the subject of a recently amended regulation, as well as of a proposal for a directive which is currently being examined by the departments of the Council that deal with the preparation of legislation.</p>
<p>As regards social security benefits, the honourable Member will no doubt be aware that the new regulation on the coordination of social security systems (Regulation No 883/2004/EC), which will enter into effect simultaneously with the appendant Implementing Regulation, will replace Regulation No 1408/71/EC, which is currently applicable. The intention is that the new regulation should, as a legal instrument in the field of mobility between Member States, be more uniform in its application, easier to transpose and more contemporary in its approach, thereby helping not only to improve the insured persons’ entitlements to social security, but also to simplify the procedures involved.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will no doubt also be aware that the proposal recently presented by the Commission for a directive improving the portability of supplementary pension rights is aimed at making employees more mobile and improving job mobility overall, by enabling mobile workers, right up to the end of their working lives, to acquire sufficient supplementary pension rights. This proposal resulted from consultations at European level, lasting over a period of years, on the need for improvements in the functioning of additional pension systems and the means whereby these may best be achieved.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has rightly observed, one of the major hindrances to people who want to work or study in another EU Member State, or, indeed, to transfer from one part of the labour market to another, is that their qualifications and skills may well not be recognised. The explicit goal of Community policy is that these obstacles be removed, and recent years have seen various Community instruments introduced and initiatives taken with a view to making the transfer of academic and professional qualifications easier. It should however be borne in mind that this is a step-by-step process, and one moreover subject to Article 149 of the Treaty, which states that the goals of Community action in the field of education include ‘encouraging the academic recognition of diplomas and periods of study’. This process is, inevitably, a matter of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>As regards academic qualifications, the national academic recognition information centres (NARIC) provide relevant information on the recognition of diplomas and study periods abroad, and positive contributions are also being made by the European Credit Transfer System and the recently introduced Diploma Supplement.</p>
<p>As regards professional qualifications, a network of national contact points was set up in the Member States to be the first port of call for questions concerning them. In parallel with the Diploma Supplement, which relates to university education, the certificate supplement was devised to meet the needs of professional qualifications, and, at the same time, a common European model for curricula vitae was proposed with the aim of making it possible to set out an individual’s qualifications and skills in a simple and effective way. Since then, another instrument has been adopted in the shape of what is termed the Europass, which helps to promote mobility in work-linked training and apprenticeship by facilitating a voluntary and Europe-wide system for accounting for periods of education and training outside the ‘home’ Member State.</p>
<p>There is increasing acknowledgment of the benefits of informal education, to which the honourable Member referred, and initiatives in the fields of education and youth are being used to encourage Member States to develop the machinery for this type of learning to be recognised. It was in 2004, under the Irish Presidency, that the Council adopted final conclusions on common European principles for the identification and validation of non-formal and informal learning processes, and the Council working party on youth issues is currently examining a draft resolution on that subject.</p>
<p>Turning to the subject of the acquisition of basic qualifications, it should be noted that the Commission recently – as part of the Lisbon Strategy’s ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme – made a recommendation on core competences, with specific reference to the IT field, and the Council and Parliament are currently examining it. The recommendation is principally intended to identify and define the core skills needed in a knowledge-based society in terms of that society’s cohesion and individuals’ self-development and employability; it is also about ensuring that, firstly, all young people, by the end of their basic education, possess the core skills needed in order to embark on adult life, and, secondly, that adults too can develop and update these skills throughout their lives.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Member States are currently being consulted on the possible creation of a European qualifications framework, the main purpose of which would be to ensure the inter-relation of national and sectoral qualification systems and thereby make it easier for individual citizens’ qualifications to be transferred and recognised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0037"></a>

<p>The United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have all opened up their labour markets to nationals of the countries of Eastern Europe. In welcoming workers from Lithuania, Poland and other new EU Member States, the former countries have managed to integrate workers from the latter countries in their labour markets and have increased their own GDP. However, the key problem of illegal labour involving the citizens of the new Member States arises in other EU Member States, in particular Germany and Austria, where restrictions on the migration of workers are being maintained. In view of this situation, does Austria still intend to maintain immigration restrictions for workers from the new EU Member States for three or five more years? What kind of example would the country currently holding the Presidency of the EU be setting for the other Member States which have not yet opened up access to their labour markets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)It should be borne in mind at the outset that an increase in the illegal employment of citizens from the new EU Member States is not a problem in Austria. As confirmed by the recent study by Biffl, Huber, and Walterskirchen: ‘Übergangsregelung zur Freizügigkeit’ [transitional arrangements for freedom of movement], Österreichisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung, [Austrian Institute for Economic Research – WIFO], February 2006, illegal employment has not become noticeably more widespread in Austria.</p>
<p>Austria intends to maintain the transitional arrangements relating to the free movement of workers for another three years. Extension of the transitional measures is not about any one country setting an example, but rather – as is clear from the accession documents – it is for each country to take a well-considered decision on the basis of its specific situation and of the state of development of its labour market.</p>
<p>The individual and autonomous decisions by each Member State must take into account the states of their respective economies and their position in the growth cycle. One essential element in this is the potential for each labour market to absorb new workers, since responsibility towards migrants requires that they be able to meet the conditions for integration and be able to maintain themselves through their own labours. The geographical location also has to be taken into consideration, since the distance between the country of origin and the place of work will determine the extent of migration. Austria, which shares borders with the new Member States of the EU, is a good example of a country whose requirements for controlling the migration of workers differ in every respect from those of such distant countries as Ireland and the United Kingdom. It is in these outcomes and in the ways in which they develop that the Member States differ from one another, so that, for the purpose of the decision on the extension of the transitional arrangements, it is of only limited usefulness to cite any one country as an example for another to follow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0043"></a>

<p>(DE)Under the terms of the 2003 accession treaty, decisions on whether or not to continue with the application of transitional measures relating to freedom of movement are a matter solely and exclusively for the Member States concerned.

<p>2006 has been declared European Year for Workers' Mobility in order to make workers aware of the advantages of working in another country or in a new sector of employment. It is asserted that this policy, which means moving from one region to another within the same country or from one country to another within the European Union with the purpose of finding work, broadening work experience or improving the skills/knowledge of workers, will contribute to the implementation of the revised Lisbon strategy. However, unemployment is still high (over 8% in the EU of 15 and over 9% in the EU of 25 at the beginning of 2005). The slight reduction is due either to State subsidisation of jobs (France) or to a reduction in the workforce actually in employment (United Kingdom 1991-2003).</p>

<p>(DE)The Council agrees with the honourable Member that mobility for workers can involve them facing difficulties and having costs to bear.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the Commission is endeavouring, through the EURES (European Employment Services) international cooperation network, to coordinate the European labour market as best it may. EURES has members and partners in the 25 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, and fosters the international mobility of workers by offering such services as information, advice and job placement to workers and employers wishing to avail themselves of the right to free movement. The portal is currently used by 500 000 enquirers a month and it carries at present 1.5 million job vacancies.</p>
<p>The network’s advice service also, however, provides jobseekers with information on living and working conditions (accommodation, education, the cost of living, health services, social security legislation, etc) in the individual Member States.</p>
<p>The year of mobility in 2006 aims to guarantee the free movement of persons as a fundamental right, and to promote both the professional and geographical mobility of workers and their efficient allocation in line with sectors’ need for labour and its productive and profitable use in the Member States. The labour market is subject to pronounced dynamics right across Europe, with jobs being extensively shifted around in the course of a year in consequence of the growth and shrinkage of industries in response to constantly changing demand, along with redundancies and recruitments. Furthermore, the European central statistical office works on the assumption that an assumed increase in new jobs of 1-2% per annum in some regions of the EU will result in a sectoral labour shortage in 2010 if there is too small an influx of labour.</p>
<p>It is, in any case, improbable that a worker seeking a quite specific job will want to move to a country or a region where such jobs are available only in small numbers. Although the total jobless figure in the European Union continues to be regrettably high, unemployment rates do vary very considerably from one sector or region to another.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1115"></a>

<p>(DE)The honourable Member asks for details of the Austrian Presidency's priorities in the sphere of employment and social policy. Austria will hold the Presidency for the first half of 2006 and during that period employment issues will be one of the focal points of the Council's work. Last year, the Council laid down the employment policy guidelines for the period from 2005 to 2008, guidelines which in principle remain valid in 2006. This year, the Council will concentrate on examining how those guidelines are implemented by the Member States. Measures in the employment sphere are of course chiefly taken using the so-called open method of coordination, i.e. without legislation being enacted.</p>
<p>At the start of the Austrian Presidency, the focus will not only be on employment issues, but also on issues relating to social inclusion and welfare protection, since the Council, drawing on work carried out by the Commission, will submit a report on these matters to the European Council at its Spring Summit in March. Further key priorities for the Austrian Presidency are: the amendment of the working time directive, continuation of the work on the coordination of laws in the sphere of social security, and consideration of the recent Commission proposal on the viability of old-age pension systems.</p>
<p>The honourable Member asks in particular whether the Presidency agrees that any new health and safety strategy should focus more closely on the implementation of existing legislation than on the enactment of new legislation. In that connection, the honourable Member is no doubt referring to the fact that, in its annual policy strategy for 2006, the Commission has announced that one of its key initiatives in 2006 will be a proposal for a new Community strategy on health and safety at work. However, that proposal will not be submitted until late 2006, when the Austrian Presidency is already over. For that reason, the Austrian Presidency will not be able to initiate discussion of that initiative itself in the Council. However, Austria intends to continue the preliminary discussions on the new Community strategy on health and safety begun under the UK Presidency. Accordingly, the Thematic Day of the Senior Labour Inspectors' Committee (SLIC), to be held in Vienna on 27 March 2006, will be devoted to a discussion of that issue.</p>
<p>I can assure the honourable Member that the Austrian Presidency will actively seek to achieve progress on the reform of the regulatory framework, as stated, for example, in the Joint Declaration on that subject. The Presidency will attach particular priority to implementing measures designed to bring about better lawmaking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0079"></a>

<p>Simplification of EU rules and regulations, which have tangible effects on businesses and members of the public. Taken together with the other ongoing efforts at (horizontal) simplification, Commissioner Verheugen’s screening initiative and the current plans for sectoral simplification get us on the right track.</p>
<p>The measurement and reduction of administrative burdens has direct effects on the persons involved. The instruments required are available to us at the European level, and now we have to make use of them.</p>
<p>The effects of EU law must be known in advance if it is to be possible to reach deliberate and well-informed decisions. Such decisions are facilitated by impact assessments, which must be produced to the highest possible quality and then made use of in the negotiating process. In this area, what is particularly crucial to the economy is the competitiveness test.</p>
<p>There is nevertheless the risk that the public and the business world will be but little aware of these activities and that these will have no real influence on their basically negative attitudes. One way of counteracting that would be to provide better information on the actual measures currently being taken to reform regulation – measures that affect the individuals concerned; a wide variety of measures are currently being taken in this area, and it is often difficult even for specialists in this field to get and keep an overview of what is going on.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, our activities must, as already mentioned, result in manifest benefits for all concerned, in the shape of cost reductions or work being made easier, for it only thus that we will reach our goal. I believe that the measures I have mentioned take us in the right direction in this respect.</p>
<p>Another important way of involving the public and businesses is certainly to consult them on regulations that will affect them. There are many initiatives to this end, but it must still be the case that the interested parties must be fully informed about the options available to them as regards consultation, with their opinions listened to at the policy-making stage, and they must also be given effective feedback about those opinions.</p>
<p>Both members of the public and businesses often tell us that important decisions and regulations tend more and more to emanate from ‘Brussels’, with the nation state’s role receding more and more into the background, so that they end up feeling powerless in relation to the EU.</p>
<p>It is surely too simple to blame ‘Brussels’ alone for this development. After all, the reason why we joined together in this Community was that we would all derive clearly measurable benefits from it. To take an example: after ten years of the single market, the EU’s GDP was 1.8%, or EUR 165 billion, greater than it had been before the advent of the single market, with 2.5 million jobs having been created and the standard of living rising by EUR 877 billion (equivalent to EUR 5 700 for each household).<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The question nevertheless arises as to whether maximising centralisation of regulation in Brussels is entirely beneficial. It is for that reason that the topic of ‘subsidiarity’ and the allocation of competences is also an important aspect of regulatory reform, raising the question as to which matters should be regulated at which level in the interests of maximum effectiveness. It is to consider this subject area that a conference on subsidiarity will be held on 18 and 19 April this year in St. Pölten.<a href="#defann_6_2" name="refann_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)The general direction taken by the Austrian Presidency with regard to the Lisbon Strategy</p>
<p>The Lisbon Process and its focus on growth and employment, which was decided in March 2005, are the basis for the direction taken by the Austrian Presidency in the fields to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>As Chancellor Schüssel said when presenting the Presidency's programme<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, during the first three months of its term of office - i.e. until the Spring Summit in March - the Austrian Presidency will concentrate on employment. Such subjects as job creation, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating jobs, and education are of are the greatest interest to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p>The direction taken by the Austrian Presidency with regard to employment issues (including the adoption of new technologies and obstacles to the employment of certain groups)</p>
<p>The main theme of the Austrian Presidency in the field of employment policy is 'Flexicurity - flexibility through security'. This entails striking a balance between flexibility and social security in Europe. These two principles are not to be regarded as alternatives but rather as complementary elements: only on the basis of properly functioning social security and insurance systems can the flexibility be achieved on the labour market which is required in the interests of international competitiveness. At the same time, preserving competitiveness is the most important precondition for the sustainability of social security systems.<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>Only qualified workers can adopt new technologies. The Austrian Presidency therefore believes that the focus should be on knowledge, innovation and optimisation of human capital.<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>During its Presidency, Austria undertakes to continue the work which was begun during previous Presidencies. In the field of employment we continue to subscribe to the objective of getting more people into employment and keeping them there. The Council adopted this objective last year in the Employment Policy Guidelines for the three-year period 2005-2008<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Guideline 18, in particular, calls on all Member States to:</p>
<p>– reduce youth unemployment,</p>
<p>– take measures to increase female participation and reduce gender gaps in employment and pay,</p>
<p>– work towards better reconciliation of work and private life,</p>
<p>– support active ageing, including appropriate working conditions for older workers, and discourage early retirement.</p>
<p>On 25 January 2006, the Commission submitted the progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, which also incorporated a draft of the Joint Employment Report. This report shows that the individual Member States, like the European Union as a whole, have adopted the right approach: for example, all the national reform programmes emphasise efforts to get more people into employment and keep them there. Special efforts are being made to improve the employment situation of women, older workers, young people and the disabled.</p>
<p>The Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) and the Commission will finalise the Joint Employment Report. The Austrian Presidency will try to ensure that the key messages of the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) to the European Council in March 2006 also take up the principal theme of 'Flexicurity - flexibility through security' and - in the context of the demographic challenges which face us - devote special attention to improving the entry of young people into the labour market. On the basis of the report submitted to it, the European Council will draw its conclusion concerning the first year of the renewed Lisbon Strategy in the field of employment.</p>
<p>Combating social exclusion</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is undoubtedly aware, the Social Protection Committee is currently drafting the second joint report by the Commission and the Council on social protection and social inclusion, so that it can be adopted at the March meeting of the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) and submitted to the European Council at its Spring Summit. In this connection it will be for the Social Policy Committee and the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) to make a political assessment of the national action plans to combat social exclusion.</p>
<p>This second joint report should assign due weight to the tasks which were defined at the informal summit at Hampton Court and which are derived from the review of the Lisbon Strategy in the spring of 2005. The report will therefore be based on the thesis that the interaction between the open method of coordination and the revised Lisbon Process should be reciprocal: social protection and social inclusion should promote the attainment of the growth and employment objectives, and the policy for growth and employment should yield social benefits. The joint report will be based on the plans and political declarations submitted by the Member States during 2005 concerning the three fields of policy 'social inclusion', 'pensions' and 'health and long-term care'.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency, for its part, will ensure that the most important results of the Joint Employment Report and of the Second Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion are duly taken into account in the key political recommendations on employment and social policy to be submitted to the European Council at its Spring Summit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)On 25 January 2006 the Commission presented the first annual progress report in accordance with the revamped Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment. The contents, particularly the draft report on employment, will be discussed in the Council (employment, social policy, health and consumer protection) on 10 March and subsequently at the European Council's spring meeting on 23 to 24 March.</p>
<p>The national reform programmes attach particular importance to combating youth unemployment and integrating young people in the labour market. Most Member States give special emphasis to this target group in their national reform programmes.</p>
<p>In the national reform programmes, Member States focus particularly on increasing employment opportunities by combining training and work and thus increasing the employment rate. Greater coordination between education, training, mobility, employment and integration policy will facilitate the transition from school to working life. Training systems are to be modernized and better adapted to the requirements of the economy, and entrepreneurship is to be promoted. Since youth unemployment is closely linked to failure at school, the proportion of young people who complete their secondary education or complete a university education (more rapidly) is to be increased. Subsequently efforts will be concentrated on pursuing an active labour market policy and improving the quality of vocational further training.</p>
<p>A number of Member States have specifically set national targets for 2010 for reducing the school dropout rate and increasing the proportion of young people who complete their secondary education. A large proportion of the additional targets in the employment sector are specifically concerned with reducing youth unemployment.</p>
<p>In areas in which some Member States have already implemented interesting and successful policies, it is intended to exploit the potential that exists there, to learn from one another and to adapt and/or adopt measures.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Strategy's 'European Pact for Youth' is intended to improve general education and vocational training, mobility and professional and social integration of young people and, at the same time, to make it easier to meet the conflicting requirements of professional and family life. This Pact is intended to ensure the proper coordination of all initiatives by involving youth organisations at all levels.</p>
<p>The Pact sets targets in the fields of employment, integration and upward social mobility; general education and vocational training, mobility and the compatibility of professional and family life (see annex). The reactions of most Member States in their national reform programmes are reassuring, according to the Commission.</p>
<p>An important new target in the progress report is to ensure that all young job seekers are given a job, or an apprenticeship, or a place in a training or similar employment measure.:</p>
<p>- within six months/by 2007;</p>
<p>- within 100 days of completing school or university/by 2010.</p>
<p>Enterprises are to be given financial and other incentives to offer for students and unemployed young people work experience.</p>
<p>From 28 to 31 May 2006 a 'Youth Event' is being organised in Vienna and Bad Ischl at the invitation of the BMSG as part of the Austrian Presidency of the EU. There will be a special workshop on 'Youth and Jobs'. The following employment policy issues, inter alia, will be discussed there: youth unemployment and measures to combat it, labour market policy vs. employment policy and work life balance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0091"></a>

<p>(DE)From the beginning to the end of the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, the Council presided over in-depth discussions of the most important issues, which were the focus of the deliberations with a view to composing a draft ministerial statement.</p>
<p>The Council observed and evaluated the progress of the negotiations on the basis of reports from Commissioners Mandelson and Fischer Boel. At various stages of the negotiations, the Council expressed its unreserved support for the Commission’s approach and actions.</p>
<p>At its last meeting, on 18 December 2005, the Council examined the final wording of the draft WTO Ministerial Statement that had emerged from the negotiating process. The Council informed Commissioners Mandelson and Fischer Boel that, in its estimation, despite certain defects and the lack of sufficient real progress on certain points, the outcome was generally acceptable. It accordingly approved the wording of the statement and noted the Commission’s intention to inform the final session of the conference that the European Community and its Member States approved the statement.</p>
<p>The Council underlined the EU’s determination to further pursue all its objectives in order that, in the next stages of the negotiations in the coming year, it might be possible to achieve far-reaching results that would be satisfactory to all parties.</p>
<p>The Council noted the Commission’s intention to state, at the meeting of the heads of delegations,</p>
<p>how important it would be for the EU to ensure, in the remaining stages of the negotiations, that non-agricultural products would be treated, for the purposes of market access, in the same way as agriculture;</p>
<p>that, in the Commission’s view, the text did not run counter to the EU’s desire that the abolition of agricultural subsidies should be given a monetary value;</p>
<p>how important it would be to the EU that an acceptable result be achieved on non-trade issues, including geographical indications.</p>
<p>The Council furthermore took note of the Commission’s statement to the effect that the progressive abolition of export subsidies should be fully consonant with the agreed reforms to the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p>The Council has taken note of the European Parliament’s debate of 16 January 2006 on the WTO Ministerial Conference and of the statements made by Commissioner Mandelson on that occasion. The Council looks forward with great interest to the evaluation of the results of Hong Kong that Parliament is to present before the end of April 2006.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 23 January 2006, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council discussed the agricultural aspects of the Hong Kong Conference, which were then examined in more general terms at the 30/31 January meeting of the General and Foreign Affairs Council, which had been preceded by an exchange of views between trade ministers on Sunday 29 January.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely monitor the further progress of the negotiations following the Hong Kong Ministerial Statement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0094"></a>

<p>(DE)The flexicurity approach is founded on the idea that the creation and maintenance of adequate social security apparatus is an indispensable requirement in terms of the development of flexibility and competitiveness, and the concern is not only with supporting the unemployed until they find another job. It is rather more about making available the facilities and programmes to ensure that, when people’s employment circumstances change, and in such ‘transitional stages’ as training and parental leave, they suffer no disadvantages and are offered pro-active support.</p>
<p>One example drawn from the European level is the Commission’s current proposal for portable supplementary pension entitlements, which operates on the ‘rucksack principle’. The object of this is to reduce obstacles to freedom of movement between and within the Member States in so far as they affect occupational pensions credits. When a worker moves from one job to another within one Member State, or where that new job involves him or her moving to another Member State, it is intended that he or she should, as a matter of principle, have the choice as to whether to leave their entitlements in the previous system – putting them on ice, so to speak – or to transfer the entitlements into the new one.</p>
<p>An example at Member State level is the introduction of modern, market-oriented forms of labour law in the formerly Communist new Member States. The establishment of unemployment support and of statutory pension schemes played an important part in creating the conditions for the market economy in that they enabled workers to move out of the big state concerns that had hitherto provided most social security benefits.</p>
<p>Another example is the Austrian creation, in 2002, of occupational severance pay and pensions funds (2002), which made employment much more flexible but no less secure. Before the reform, workers were responsible for their own severance payments, a requirement founded on the presupposition that employment would be for many years or indeed lifelong. This obligation was transferred to independent employee welfare funds, to which employers make monthly contributions. The consequence of this was that employees would be entitled to severance pay irrespective of any change of employer, while, at the same time, employers would be able to divide up their severance benefits regularly over a period of time and thereby have a better idea of their financial position.</p>
<p>The Employment Committee (EMCO), too, considered the topic of “Flexicurity – Flexibility through Security" when it met in Bad Ischl on 9 February. At this meeting, various case studies were presented from Austria, Poland and Norway, and it was agreed that the specific situation in each country was crucial in determining not only the practical aspects of the introduction of flexicurity-oriented measures but also the costs involved.</p>
<p>The committee also welcomed what the Commission had to say about flexicurity in its country-by-country progress report. As well as including flexicurity in the draft Key Issues Paper for the forthcoming Employment and Social Affairs Council, the Committee will be setting up a smaller group of experts under Danish chairmanship. This group will produce a working paper, on whose conclusions the Employment and Social Affairs Council in June will draw.</p>
<p>We expect the Green Paper on developments in labour law, which the Commission has announced and which is due to appear before the end of the Austrian Presidency, to trigger general discussion of current trends in the development of new work structures and the demands these will make of labour law at both the national and European level. It is intended that not only the European institutions and the Member States should engage in this discussion, but also and in particular the social partners at national and European level.</p>
<p>It follows that it is, at this stage, still premature to think in terms of specific legislative action, which can in any case be embarked on only as and when the Commission has presented the relevant proposals. The Commission will no doubt wish, in the first instance, to await the outcome of consultations on the subject of the forthcoming Green Paper before deciding whether actual legislation should form part of any future initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1121"></a>

<p>Taking into account the principle of subsidiarity, what steps does the Austrian Presidency intend to take towards improving women’s health in the EU-25, with specific emphasis on the field of gynaecology and obstetrics, for example premature births, miscarriages, infertility, the menopause and cancer prevention?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)The Council wishes to thank the honourable Member for bringing this important issue to its attention.</p>
<p>The Treaty requires that the ultimate goal of all health-related activities should be the improvement of the health of the European public. Women’s health, which includes their reproductive health, is vitally important to the welfare of people in the EU and is also significant in view of Europe’s ageing population and of the falling fertility rates. The Austrian Presidency therefore regards it one of its priorities that this issue should be given greater prominence at European level.</p>
<p>Issues relating to women’s health, notably cardiovascular diseases and the increased incidence of lung cancer consequent upon a rise in the numbers of women who smoke will therefore be key points in the discussions at the informal meeting of EU health ministers in April, which will also give particular attention to such diseases as endometriosis and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency intends to present the Council’s June meeting with draft conclusions on women’s health, in which the Commission will be asked to produce a report on the situation as regards women’s health in the EU of 25 and to attach greater importance to the gender dimension in health policy.</p>
<p>At its June meeting, the Council will also consider the proposal for a European Parliament and Council resolution in favour of a Community action programme on health and consumer protection, which is also relevant to women’s health. The Presidency will therefore endeavour to reach political agreement on this important proposal, although this will be dependent on the outcome of the European Parliament’s vote, on the negotiations on the 2007-2013 financial framework and on the timetable envisaged for this.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0042"></a>

<p>The EU endorsed last December’s resolution of the UN General Assembly on the human rights situation in Iran, which expressed grave concern over the ongoing discrimination against religious minorities, and called on Iran to desist from all types of discrimination against members of religious minorities, and from other violations of their human rights.</p>

The Iranian Government agreed to comply with this request and to supply the EU with the information requested. The EU also expressed its concerns about the Mahrami case in the course of the EU/Iran human rights dialogue.</p>
<p>The human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran dates back to 2002; the last meeting was held in the summer of 2004, since when, despite repeated attempts, the EU has not been able to arrange another meeting. The EU has called on Iran to demonstrate its respect for human rights and its commitment to dialogue with the EU.

<p>(DE)Following the introduction of the revived Lisbon strategy and of a new system of administration, in 2005, the Member States were urged to include in their national reform programmes (NRPs) quantitative targets for expenditure on research.</p>
<p>In the first NRP, which was submitted to the Commission at the end of 2005, 18 Member States set themselves quantifiable targets. None of these have achieved the expenditure target set for 2010, namely 3% of GDP, two-thirds of which, it should be noted, is meant to be funded by the private business sector, although it must be stressed that the targets set by the Member States correspond to an increase in (public and private) research expenditure to 2.6% of GDP by 2010 – a marked improvement over the present state of affairs, which the honourable Member rightly described as amounting to virtual stagnation (with current research spending amounting on average to 1.9% of GDP, 55% of it coming from business and industry). <a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Encouraging though the political will expressed in these quantified targets certainly is, the target aimed for is still rather less than the 3% set by the European Council at its meeting in Barcelona in 2002.</p>
<p>The Presidency will therefore constantly reiterate the importance of the shared Barcelona target, which will be crucial in enabling us to achieve the necessary edge over our competitors, although it is of course left to the individual Member States to take the necessary action to get more funding made available for research and development.</p>

<p>The Presidency has included among its priorities the continuation of talks to adopt common rules on the coexistence of GMOs with other forms of agricultural production. The Presidency is also aware of the demands of consumers, environmental organisations and producers, which have tended towards national preferences for organic and certified products. The present directive on GMOs and the Commission's approach to its administration is impeding the implementation of such policies, which has economic - and other - repercussions for the Member States, such as evidence of the effects of the coexistence of GMOs with conventional or organic crops and compensation for producers in the event of contamination. Furthermore, it has also been pointed out that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) bases its assessments solely on laboratory criteria, which are often far removed from reality.</p>
<p>Will the Presidency take the above considerations into account in order to improve the method of taking decisions at Community level and avoid implementing the current system across the board?</p>

<p>(DE)I am very glad that the honourable Member has put this question, which perfectly reflects the concerns of the Austrian Presidency. Parliament’s support will be of great value to the Presidency in its efforts to introduce a Community-wide policy on GMOs that will be guided by the public’s expectations and concerns while also taking full account of the need for health and the environment to be protected.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has emphasised, GMOs raise a whole range of issues around their long-term effects on health and the environment, and it is also to be borne in mind that (following a highly favourable assessment by the EFSA), the Commission is set to approve a number of GMOs despite the frequent votes by simple majority of the Member States in the Council against such approval.</p>
<p>The Environment Council will be having an in-depth discussion of this problem on 9 March 2006, in which issues of how to improve the assessment of GMOs’ safety, and also greater transparency in the approval procedure, will be considered.</p>
<p>The other important problem thrown up by GMOs is that of how they are to coexist with conventional and organic crops, that is to say, how to put in place more effective protection of conventional and organic crops against unintentional contamination by GMOs.</p>
<p>I can confirm to you that a conference prepared by the Commission will be held in the Austrian capital at the beginning of April and that what emerges from it will be taken as the basis for in-depth discussion at Council level in May, when the Council will – or so I hope – produce conclusions or recommendations concerning the introduction of common mandatory rules for coexistence with GMOs. This would be a way of avoiding the adverse effects of which the honourable Member was so rightly critical.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to point out that the Austrian Presidency is planning to hold a scientific conference on the precautionary principle in GMO policy, to be held in Vienna on 18 and 19 April.</p>
<p>I can therefore assure the honourable Member that the Presidency will do its utmost to address the issues relating to GMOs that she has raised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0096"></a>

<p>(EN)In 2003, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was the object of a major reform. The new single payment scheme has since been extended to include the majority of the CAP market sectors, with the notable exception of the wine, bananas and fruit and vegetables sectors, which are up for their own review in 2006/2007.</p>
<p>Though the reform included review clauses for the new instruments, and certain market sectors, in the period 2007-2010, the 2003 Reform was agreed in accordance with the conclusions of the Berlin, Göteborg and Brussels Summits, within an agriculture budgetary framework for the enlarged EU, set at the time until 2013.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is correct in stating that, in December 2005, the European Council reached a political agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspectives, which requests the Commission to make "a full wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources, including the United Kingdom rebate, to report in 2008/2009”.</p>
<p>However, the 2007-2013 financial perspectives are currently the object of trialogue discussions between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p>Consequently, until the wording of the final decision is known, the Commission is not yet in a position to comment on what implications the agreement may have for the method and level of funding of the CAP.

<p>(EN)Reply to oral question</p>
<p><a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0033_EN.html">H-0033/06</a></p>
<p>by Ms McGuinness</p>
<p>February II 2006</p>
<p>The agreement reached by the Heads of Government in December 2005 offers clarity on the financial resources available for farmers and rural communities. It respects the agreement made in Brussels in 2002 concerning expenditure for direct payments and expenditure. However, all market and direct aid expenditure related to the enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania will have to be financed within the ceiling for EU-25. This increases the probability that financial discipline will have to be applied and lead to a limited reduction of direct incomes support payments for farmers in the old Member States.</p>
<p>As regards rural development, the amount agreed by the Heads of Government is less than the amount proposed by the Commission and also smaller than the amount available in the current period. This can of course affect our ability to meet the challenges facing rural areas, particularly in the context of ongoing Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the Lisbon agenda or Natura 2000.</p>
<p>However, what is important now is to start the programming of rural development for the new period. The Parliament opinion on the Rural Development Strategic Guidelines to be adopted during this session will therefore be a very important step forward.</p>
<p>Voluntary modulation, shifting funds from direct payments to rural development, was introduced for the first time in Agenda 2000, which allowed Member States to transfer up to 20% of their direct payments on a voluntary basis. Very few Member States made use of this possibility and it was replaced by an EU wide compulsory modulation system during the 2003 CAP reform based on a franchise of € 5000. It is the Commission’s view that this system is a fairer, more coherent and more effective way of achieving this shift.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view the proposed system of voluntary modulation, presents a number of technical difficulties. The application of modulation on market related expenditure seems technically impossible. The lack of a cofinancing obligation will reduce the overall financial effort devoted to rural areas, while the derogation from the rule that expenditure should be balanced between objectives may undermine the contribution to certain EU priorities. In all cases, the system should be established in a manner which does not cause delays in the agreement of programmes, particularly for those Member States which do not wish to make use of the system.</p>
<p>If the system were adopted in its current form, it would be appropriate to review its functioning within the general review of the Community Budget foreseen for 2008/2009. In particular because it would be very difficult to go ahead with further compulsory modulation, as previously suggested by the Commission, if voluntary modulation will be applied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0047"></a>

<p>(EN)Feta, a Greek Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for a cheese, was finally registered by the Commission in 2002. Several Member States applied for annulment of the registration under Article 230 of the Treaty.

<p>The Commission understands the honourable Member’s concerns about a lengthy legal procedure and the inconvenience and cost that can result.

The Commission has no intention of compensating operators for costs resulting from this type of legal action.</p>

<p>(EN)The basic regulation on the Common Market Organisation for beef and veal foresees that within the limits resulting from International Agreements, the difference between the quotations or prices of certain live bovine animals and beef products on the world market and prices in the Community market may be covered by export refunds to the extent necessary to enable their export.</p>
<p>These refunds can therefore not be considered subsidies for the transport of live animals.</p>
<p>On 23 December 2005, the Commission presented at the Beef Management Committee a draft Regulation aiming at eliminating refunds for live bovine animals for slaughter. The Commission adopted this Regulation on the same day and it was published and entered into force on the 24 December 2005.</p>
<p>Since then, export refunds for live cattle are therefore limited to female pure bred bovine animals of a maximum 30 months of age exported to all destinations but Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>This decision reflects the improved situation on the EU beef market and follows growing public concern about the treatment of animals when they are shipped abroad for slaughter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Regulation (EC) n° 639/03 laying down detailed rules as regards requirements for the granting of export refunds related to the welfare of live bovine animals during transport is in the process of being further reinforced.

<p>(EN)The problem of illegal waste shipments raises serious issues of environmental concern. The Commission has therefore closely monitored the results of inspections carried out by the IMPEL network<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This network found in 2004 a significant rate of illegal waste shipments in a number of Member States. The results of IMPEL’s inspections were presented to national authorities at a meeting concerning implementation of waste legislation organised by the Commission in September 2004.</p>
<p>IMPEL’s inspections of October 2005 show that illegal waste shipments remain at a high level. The Commission met with waste shipment experts from Member States in November 2005 to deal, inter alia, with these matters. The Commission considers that efforts to increase coordination and awareness should be further intensified in order to combat illegal waste shipments. This year the Commission therefore envisages organising training for national authorities, such as customs services, aimed at raising the awareness and improving co-operation concerning the enforcement of Community legislation on waste shipments.</p>
<p>In the near future Community legislation on waste shipments will be strengthened when a new regulation is adopted by the Parliament and the Council and becomes applicable. This regulation will specifically address the issues of illegal shipments and gaps in enforcement. It will enhance cooperation between Member States to facilitate the prevention and detection of illegal shipments as well as rules on inspections and spot checks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Since the end of the 1980s, Northern Ireland has benefited from EU financial support in favour of peace and reconciliation. This is a concrete expression of EU solidarity towards the peace process established by the 1998 Belfast Agreement.</p>
<p>In 1989, the European Community became one of the main sources of funding for the International Fund for Ireland (IFI), an international organisation established by a treaty between the United Kingdom and Irish Governments "to promote economic and social development, and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland". The European Community currently contributes € 15 million per year to the IFI.</p>
<p>In addition, in 1995, the European Community set up a special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (the "PEACE Programme"), which operates in Northern Ireland and in the Border Region of Ireland. This programme aims "to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation in the region". From 2000 to date the PEACE II programme has continued work towards this objective and the European Council allocated a further € 200 million for the period 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p>The EU’s commitment to peace and reconciliation has therefore been amply demonstrated.</p>
<p>The appointment of a judge to examine past events in Northern Ireland is a decision on a sensitive matter to be taken by the Member States involved, with the benefit of their specialised knowledge of the region and of the historical background.

<p>(EN)This issue is of obvious concern to all of Europe’s citizens, particularly in light of the forthcoming World Cup tournament in Germany this year.</p>
<p>Begging is an obvious social problem, with undesirable consequences for both the people who practice it as well as the people who are subject to it.</p>
<p>In the process of building an area of Justice, Freedom and Security, the Commission is involved in increasing coordination, cooperation and information sharing amongst Member State police forces focusing especially on organised crime. Insomuch as organised, begging constitutes criminal activity, for instance when linked with trafficking in human beings and the corresponding measures can be used. On the other hand, due to the cross-border nature of problems related to major sporting competitions such as the World Cup, there are specific measures in place where Member States’ services are collaborating to minimise crime, public disorder and violence often associated with such events.</p>
<p>Under the Hague Programme of 2004<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission has been tasked with taking forward several initiatives which are likely to be relevant to this particular issue. The specific actions to develop in this context have been detailed in the joint Council and Commission Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme.<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> A key demand of the Hague Programme is that information exchange between Member State law enforcement authorities by subject to the Principle of Availability by 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2008. This means, in effect, that information should move between law enforcement agencies, without the fact that it crosses national borders presenting any sort of impediment. Work is already underway on this issue, with the Commission having recently put a proposal for a Framework Decision before the Council.</p>
<p>General police cooperation has likewise been made a priority. On 18<span class="sup">th</span> July 2005 the Commission adopted a proposal on improvement of law enforcement cooperation at the internal borders between Member States, and this has been followed up by monthly meetings of the police cooperation working group.<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Furthermore, the European Police College has now been given the status of a body of the Union following adoption of a Commission proposal on 20<span class="sup">th</span> September 2005,<a href="#defann_37_4" name="refann_37_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> which should be an important move forward in strengthening police cooperation and mutual understanding. Likewise, an exchange programme for police officers has been included as a priority in the AGIS<a href="#defann_37_5" name="refann_37_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> programme for 2006. All of these measures will enhance the ability of national police forces to tackle cross-border crime more effectively.</p>
<p>Insomuch as these gangs of beggars appear to be organised, the Commission is developing a specific strategy on organised crime at an EU level, and indeed a Communication on this subject was recently presented.<a href="#defann_37_6" name="refann_37_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Key objectives are to improve knowledge of the phenomenon and to strengthen prevention, investigation and cooperation on organised crime in the EU. The strategy is also to involve the intensification of cooperation with third countries and international organisations such as Interpol and Europol.</p>
<p>The honourable Member understandably voices particular concern in relation to the forthcoming World Cup being held in Germany later in the year. In addition to the initiatives outlined above, the Commission actively supports the development of improved crime prevention and control initiatives for international sporting events, and football events in particular. A key area of concentration has been on the exchange of experience between EU Member States in order to establish common standards of safety and public order. In particular, there is Council Resolution of 6<span class="sup">th</span> December 2001<a href="#defann_37_7" name="refann_37_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, concerning a handbook with recommendations for international police cooperation, and measures to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with football matches with an international dimension, in which at least one Member State is involved. In addition, a Council Working Group deals with aspects of violence occurring at sporting events and at football matches in particular.</p>
<p>The Commission has developed, and is indeed in the process of developing initiatives that should do much to enhance the ability of national police forces to tackle cross border activities with a criminal element.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As for all chapters, the screening report will include a recommendation as to whether the chapter is ready to be opened for negotiation. If the Commission considers that negotiations should not begin on a given chapter, it may propose benchmarks to be met in order to allow the opening of that chapter. According to the procedures set out in the framework for accession negotiations, benchmarks will include inter alia, depending on the chapter, “the fulfilment of commitments under the Association Agreement, in particular those pertaining to the EC-Turkey customs union and those that mirror requirements under the acquis”. In this respect, the Council Decision on the Accession Partnership with Turkey, which is monitored in the bodies established by the Association Agreement, lays down, among the short term priorities, the need to “remove all restrictions to free circulation of goods due to discrimination against carriers of Member States, on the ground of their nationality or previous dockings”.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Spanish is the language with the fifth highest number of speakers in the EU, the fourth most widely taught as a foreign language, and the fastest-growing EU language in terms of numbers of speakers both within and outside the Union.

<p>(EN)The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission remains as committed as ever to the principle of multilingualism. According to Article 1 of Regulation No 1/1958 of the Council<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, all official EU languages are to be treated on an equal basis as far as the publication of legislation and other documents of general application is concerned.</p>
<p>This means that Spanish has the same status as any other official language. Moreover, no translator will lose his or her job. There will be no disadvantages for the translators concerned with respect to grade, salary, career development or any other similar aspects.</p>
<p>The principle of multilingualism is not linked to the number of speakers of a language, but is a democratic necessity: citizens of the EU must be able to read documents that directly apply to them in the official language of their country, whether they have 40 million or 400 000 native speakers. It is therefore logical that Spanish, Slovak, Dutch, Swedish and all the other official languages are treated equally, so that all EU citizens are granted the same democratic rights.</p>
<p>However, the Commission may, under Article 6 of Regulation No 1/1958 of the Council, decide which of the official and working languages are to be used for its internal communication. This should not be confused with the obligation to fully respect the principle of multilingualism in the translation of documents of a legislative or regulatory nature.</p>
<p>The human resources strategy of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation is an internal management tool which aims to make the most efficient use of existing resources. In general, the English, French and German language departments require more staff needed for the editing of originals, translating incoming documents from the Member States, etc.</p>
<p>Translating staff will be used appropriately to respond to new and growing demand, also in other linguistic areas such as web translation, editing, and in general reinforcing multilingualism in all aspects of the Commission’s activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In July 2005, the Commission agreed on an ‘action plan to improve communicating Europe’. At the end of 2004, the Spanish Government submitted a proposal to the Council of the European Union seeking authorisation for Spain’s co-official languages (Catalan, Galician and Basque) to be used in certain circumstances, including in written correspondence between Spanish citizens and EU institutions. This would be financed by the Spanish Government.</p>
<p>While other institutions have already agreed to this, I am aware of the political difficulties surrounding the proposal that may arise at Parliament. However, as there are no problems with funding, I think that the Community’s political representatives should realise how important the request is.

I do not agree with the arguments advanced in Commissioner Figel's reply, and I feel it does not provide a full answer as to whether the Commission is maintaining the plans made public in early November 2005, which entailed, inter alia, an unacceptable reduction in the numbers of Spanish translators which takes no account of such crucial factors as the number of Spanish speakers and the remarkable growth of the language both within and outside the Union. Can the Commission state whether it intends to continue with those plans or whether it has decided to modify them in line with public opinion, the stand taken by the Spanish Government and my own position, in order to avoid damaging the remarkable value added represented for the Union by the use of Spanish as one of its main official languages and ensure it is not discriminated against by comparison with English, French and German?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The strategy of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation is an internal management tool which aims to make the most efficient use of existing resources, following the Demand Management Strategy put in place after the 2004 enlargement to cope with the severe lack of translation capacity in the new languages<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This strategy has lead to a reduction of the number of documents to be translated, which in turn has reduced the need for translators in the languages of the old Member States. In this context, it has proven necessary to allocate part of the existing translation capacity to tasks linked with multilingualism such as web translation, terminology, etc., which are in increasing demand as they constitute a means of communicating directly with the citizens.</p>
<p>This strategy involves all linguistic departments and does not by any means affect the status of any of the official EU languages.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the overall number of linguistic staff will not be reduced; no translator will lose his or her job. Translating staff will be used appropriately to respond to new and growing demand, also in other linguistic areas such as web translation, editing, and in general reinforcing multilingualism in all aspects of the Commission’s activities.</p>
<p>There will be no disadvantages for the translators concerned with respect to grade, salary, career development or any other similar aspects.</p>
<p>The principle of multilingualism is not linked to the number of speakers of a language in the world, but is a democratic necessity: citizens of the EU must be able to read documents that directly apply to them in the official language of their country, whether they have 40 million or 400 000 native speakers. It is therefore logical that for example Spanish, Slovak, Dutch, Swedish and all the other official languages are treated equally, so that all EU citizens are granted the same democratic rights.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that it remains as committed as ever to the principle of multilingualism and the application of Council Regulation 1/1958<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It introduces more comprehensive and consistent rules of handling inside information throughout the financial markets in Europe. As a rule, issuers are now required to inform the public as soon as possible of inside information which directly concerns them. When they disclose inside information to any third party in the normal exercise of their duties, they must make effective public disclosure of the same information either simultaneously (in the case of intentional disclosure) or promptly (non-intentional disclosure). This obligatory disclosure does not apply if the third party owes a duty of confidentiality to the issuer.</p>
<p>The Market Abuse Directive has indeed made the issuers (and other persons concerned) more watchful of the proper handling of inside information disclosure. They now take greater responsibility for the access of third parties to inside information. The Commission thinks this is a good development. The Commission is also confident that existing and prospective shareholders will recognise the efforts of companies to comply with disclosure rules from the Market Abuse Directive while ensuring a steady and meaningful flow of information on their activities to the public.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that in this early period of application of the Market Abuse Directive issuers will receive guidance from the national securities regulators responsible for supervision and enforcement of market abuse rules.

<p>(EN)The honourable Member refers to a specific case of a company which has been the subject of an EU financial audit. This is difficult for the Commission to comment on, in the absence of more precise information. As a general rule however, it is a condition of Commission funding that projects financed from the EU budget may be subject to such an ex-post control, as foreseen in Article 60.4 of the Financial Regulations. The Commission reviews the Financial Regulation regularly, as foreseen within Article 184 thereof. The last review took place in 2005 and led to a proposal for the amendment of the Financial Regulation<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which is currently being negotiated with Council and Parliament and which the Commission proposes will come into force on 1 January 2007. As Article 184 provides for a revision of the Financial Regulation every three years or whenever it proves necessary, a further revision can be expected to start in 2007/2008, for entry into force in 2010.</p>
<p>When carrying out such audits, the Commission applies the relevant international standards. They include the possibility to comment on the auditor's findings and recommendations: a company or any other body that has been audited therefore has the possibility, during what is known as the "contradictory procedure", to bring further information to the Commission’s attention that may cause a revision with regard to the initial position. This should be done in writing (letter or e-mail), a means which is affordable for a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME).</p>
<p>On the more general point raised, the Commission means to assist SMEs and wishes to highlight the following:</p>
<p>- The Commission adopted a Communication on Modern SME Policy for Growth and Jobs, aiming at creating a comprehensive policy framework for SME actions, in November 2005. It foresees actions to be taken to ensure that SMEs are taken into account when assessing or preparing EU legislation, and to simplify the rules and reduce the procedures for SMEs to participate in Community programmes. The Commission would welcome parliamentary support to further reduce the administrative burden for SMEs and strengthen their participation in Community programmes.</p>
<p>- The Commission has upgraded the role of SME Envoy, which is now carried out by the Deputy Director General of DG ENTR<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The SME Envoy and her team are in charge of mainstreaming the SME dimension in EU policies, listening to SMEs and their representatives and highlighting their concerns to the different Commission services. The SME Envoy can be contacted directly at ENTR-SME-ENVOY@cec.eu.int</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>- The Euro Info Centre (EIC) network provides detailed, appropriate and expert advice to SMEs on EU matters - including Community programmes. There are nearly 270 EICs and over 300 local EIC relay points across Europe. Indeed the Commission has developed two new mechanisms in order to improve the feedback from SMEs into community policy-making via the EIC network: “SME feedback” and the “SME panel”. “SME feedback” will identify difficulties encountered by SMEs in the implementation of European legislation or policies while the “SME panel” will test a piece of legislation or a policy in preparation among a panel of local SMEs. Therefore the nearest EIC may be able to look at the issue with the SME in question.</p>
<p>- In addition specific tools and actions have been developed or are under consideration to improve information available to SMEs on ongoing and forthcoming programmes and to support their participation in EU programmes, including SME help-desks, local contact points or dedicated calls for proposals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Article 8 of the Directive subjects the processing of personal data relating to the health status of a person to special conditions. In substance their processing requires the consent of the data subject, or a national law allowing their processing and laying down appropriate safeguards, for instance in the framework of the provision of medical care of the management of health care services, or when it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject. The Directive allows Member States the processing of these sensitive data for other reasons of substantial public interest provided that they set up suitable safeguards.</p>

<p>(EN)The character of the EU, its institutional complexity and the absence of a unified and homogenous “European” public opinion are important challenges when defining Communication priorities.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that the European public has a relatively weak perception of the EU’s external assistance and its role in the world. While European public opinion surveys have revealed that Europeans are extremely positive towards the idea of providing development aid, only few associate the European Union with Development Policy. The Commission is very much aware of this and, together with Member States, other EU institutions and International organisations, is taking up this challenge. The communication action plan of Directorate General (DG) Development foresees a large variety of activities, both in all EU Member States and in our partner countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP), to promote European development policy. To reach best the various target groups, the Commission has put a special emphasis on information support to press and media. Special training seminars for journalists from the new Member States and from partner countries are organised in Brussels and weekly and monthly newsletters are sent electronically. The Commission has also developed various audiovisual products during 2005 to support the visibility of development policy and in particular Europe’s support to the MDGs (Millennium Development Goals). Some of these products were also part of an information campaign targeted at the public at large at the occasion of the United Nations World Summit in September 2005. The Commission has produced and marketed various TV spots, it has also produced and distributed various VideoNewsReleases as a service to the audiovisual media. Not to forget our publications. A special website on the main European initiatives in development policy during 2005 and, in particular on Europe’s support to the MDGs was put online in September 2005 and will be further developed this year. To connect with people in Europe, the Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid is also happy to the response to his web page and he has been happy to organise an Internet Chat with European citizens. The Commission will continue to strengthen its efforts in this area during 2006. It considers these communication activities important for the visibility of its foreign actions. It is important that with the different policy and communication initiative taken we communicate that European engagement is a value added for Africa and African development is a value added to Europe. The Commission shall do its part but success is dependent on other positive engagements. The EU as such provides more than half of the Worlds Official Development Aid. Clearly the EU deserves more visibility for its huge contribution to combat and eradicate poverty, also for the part that goes directly from Member States or via International organisations.</p>
<p>Heads of States and Governments declared at the end of the June 2005 European Council, a “period of reflection”, following the negative votes in France and the Netherlands on the European Constitution. Already in July 2005 the Commission agreed an action plan to improve communicating Europe. The action plan was followed by a Plan D agreed by the Commission, in October 2005. The Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate sets out a structured process to stimulate a public debate on the future of the European Union. As part of the ambition of informing people on EU’s role through concrete achievements and projects and listening to people’s expectations about what should be done in the future, there is a clear reference to Europe’s borders and its role in the world. The Group of RELEX (External Relations) Commissioners is taking this task seriously and is jointly approaching the challenge.</p>
<p>The challenges of today’s world are big, but the Commission has a good story to tell. Together with Member States, other EU institutions, other international organisations and the civil society, the Commission shall tell that story and shall hear what the citizens have to say.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid is personally engaged together with the Vice President for Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy and other colleagues to respond to this challenge.</p>
<p>Communicating the achievements of the EU development policy and the external assistance to the citizens was, is and it will be one of the Commission’s priorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0031"></a>

<p>Does the Commission consider that abolishing the objective criteria of tonnage and engine power to determine the composition of the crew, the age-limit for withdrawing superannuated vessels from service and the total liberalisation of economy-class tickets are in the interests of the users of these services, and of employment and development on the Greek islands or do they exclusively serve the interests and the profitability of the shipping companies and should the Commission, therefore, reconsider its position?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)In its reasoned opinion addressed to Greece on 19/12/2005, the Commission pointed out the need to comply with Regulation (EC) 3577/1992<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which applies the fundamental principle of the free provision of coastal shipping services.</p>
<p>Opening these services up to competition allows them to be provided at a lower cost for passengers and the community in general. In the event that private initiative is insufficient, public service obligations may be imposed. Although the EC Treaty takes account of the special nature of island regions, island coastal shipping services cannot, however, all be automatically classed as public services. Greece must justify the need for the public service obligations imposed for each of the lines in question.</p>
<p>In its reasoned opinion, the Commission has not expressed any grievance relating to the age-limit established by Greek legislation for the withdrawal of superannuated vessels.</p>
<p>The Commission’s reasoned opinion does not imply the total liberalisation of economy-class tickets. The Commission has only noted that almost all of the island lines are subject to price cap measures without any proof being reported, and even researched, to show that, on the lines in question as a whole, market forces alone will not be sufficient to ensure satisfactory price levels in terms of public service requirements. There are several lines with a significant amount of traffic throughout the year and on which there are several operators, for which such a framework has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p>With regard to the determination of crews, the Commission has stated that for each category of seafarers, Greek legislation stipulates the number of them that must be employed on a vessel, solely on the basis of its tonnage, the number of passengers authorised to be carried and the time of year. By prohibiting operators from being able to take account of the type of vessel in question and of its specific needs, this legislation hinders the freedom of operators to chose the manner in which they provide their services to users, without the usefulness of the legislation in question in terms of safety and environmental protection concerns having been demonstrated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Language skills are developed in separate specific courses, covering 28 languages. All staff are able to develop their language competence in any of these languages, in line with both the multilingualism policy of the Commission and specific work-based needs.

Does the Commissioner really believe that the attempt by the Turkish Government to conflate the issue of the obligations it has incurred, through its signature of the Customs Union and the decision of the Council of Ministers of 3.10.2005 initiating accession negotiations, and the strengthening of ties with, and the upgrading of, the Turkish Cypriot regime is worthy of serious consideration and constitutes an attempt to move forward on the Cyprus issue? Will the Commission say why, instead of insisting, as it should, on the timely ratification and smooth implementation of the Customs Union Protocol, it has rushed out a statement that it agrees essentially to changes in the agenda of the obligations of Turkey, a candidate country, thereby contributing to the 'deculpabilisation' of Turkey in respect of its contractual obligations?

<p>(EN)Following the Parliament resolution on the difficulties faced by the European beekeeping sector in 2003, the Commission has taken into consideration economic losses caused by bee mortality in its support policy on beekeeping.</p>
<p>When Council Regulation concerning national beekeeping programmes has been modified in 2004, eligible actions within those programmes have been explicitly extended to the restocking of hives to consider bee mortality (which is a reality in some regions of the EU).</p>
<p>Under this new action, purchase of colonies and breeding queens can be financed by the Commission and Member States within the national beekeeping programmes in order to limit the economic impact of bee mortality on European beekeepers.</p>
<p>Among the € 23 million available in the EU budget for 2005 for beekeeping programmes, national beekeeping programmes sent by the Member States to the Commission showed that around € 1.5 million had been allocated to this specific action.</p>
<p>The placing on the market and authorisation of plant protection products is regulated by Council Directive 91/414/EEC. This Directive provides that pesticides may only be used if it has been demonstrated that their use bears no unacceptable effects on human and animal health, and the environment. This assessment covers the risks to honeybees and their larvae and the tests applied are based on standards developed by intergovernmental organisations such as the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, in which 47 governments collaborate. Its standards are periodically reviewed. The part on honeybees has been revised in 2002/2003 and the Commission is therefore not convinced of their obsolete nature.</p>
<p>Currently, the Community is running a wide programme of re-evaluation of old pesticides which started in 1993 and must be concluded in 2008.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is surprised that some of the substances continue to be on certain markets. However, it must be underlined that pending a Commission act national rules remain applicable.</p>
<p>This is also the case for the two insecticides that French beekeepers hold responsible for the increased mortality of their bees, namely fipronil (commercial name Regent®) and imidacloprid (commercial name Gaucho®) and to which the honourable Member is most probably referring.</p>
<p>These substances have been suspended by the French authorities since several years and their safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is ongoing.</p>
<p>The Commission is awaiting the results from this assessment. For fipronil, the conclusions of EFSA are expected by March 2006 and for imidacloprid after the summer. After submission of this scientific assessment, the Commission will have six months to take a decision on whether the use of these substances is acceptable.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission is treating the legislative elections in Angola as a particular priority, since they are a significant test of the government’s and the country’s commitment to moving towards democracy. The general situation in Angola four years after the end of the war, as described in the oral question, leads to enormous practical and logistical challenges in terms of organising the elections. President dos Santos has not yet officially announced the date of the elections, but the latest information suggests that it is less and less likely that they will be held in 2006.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures supported by the Commission in Angola, the ‘emergency mine action program for sustainable return and resettlement’, with a contribution of € 26 million, is directly aimed at the challenges identified and contributes to creating the conditions for holding elections.</p>
<p>A significant effort is also being made with a view to contributing to national reconciliation, both at central and at local level, with direct support for projects in the field of human rights and support for the democratic process, with organisations from Angolan local society, with appropriations from the Democracy and Human Rights budget line.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and as pointed out recently in the reply to written question 2512/05 by Mr Ribeiro-Castro, the Commission has informed the Angolan Government on several occasions of its willingness to contribute actively and more directly to the preparations for the elections, but the government has not yet responded officially to this offer of support. However, the Commission believes that the Angolan Government may take up the offer of support for the preparations for the elections, when the date of the elections is announced officially.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0057"></a>

Poland and the Czech Republic were granted a derogation period until the end of 2007, allowing them to charge a reduced level of VAT on new housing.

<p>On 19 January 2006, 'Coca Cola 3E' announced the closure of its factory in Athens and its warehouses on Rhodes, Corfu and at Messolonghi, with the loss of hundreds of jobs and immediate redundancy for 150 workers. In view of the fact that the company's profits rose during the first six months of 2005 alone to € 205 million, from € 156 million for the same period in 2004 - an increase of 17% - it appears that what the company calls 'restructuring' is no more than an expression of its intent to increase its enormous profits even further. This situation confirms that it is not only loss-making companies which carry out redundancies but even the most profitable and 'sound' because, in the name of 'competitiveness', they treat workers as expendable commodities.</p>

Major European network operators, on the other hand, are still subject to double supervision by the competition authorities and regulatory authorities.

It has since proved to be a curb on investment in new networks and markets.</p>

<p>(EN)It is somewhat misleading to suggest that the telecoms sector in the EU lags behind the United States (US); in broadband communications, for example, several Member States have higher penetrations than the US. Competition between US cable companies and incumbents is driving investment in fibre. Competition between infrastructures has allowed regulatory authorities in the US to relax the access rules on the fibre networks of incumbents. Nevertheless, US incumbents are still subject to supervision by state and national authorities<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Many European incumbents have decided to exploit fully their existing copper access networks rather than invest in fibre at present. To some extent this is due to significant differences in network architectures in the US and EU, and particularly to technical limitations in US networks, where the length of the local loop makes xDSL deployment impossible for up to 60% of US households.</p>
<p>Recent data from the European Competitive Telecommunications Association (ECTA) indicates that investment in Europe has grown at a faster rate than in North America or the Asia Pacific since the introduction of the current regulatory Framework, which was in 2002<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and not ten years ago, albeit with significant differences between Member States. For example, telecoms investment in Germany was € 57 per capita compared with € 154 per capita for the United Kingdom<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The honourable Member urges the Commission to consider introducing an opt-out of sector-specific regulation or the inclusion of a sunset clause in the interests of investment certainty during its forthcoming review of the EU legislation. Withdrawal of price and access regulation is already foreseen in the current framework whenever markets are effectively competitive, as is the principle that emerging markets should not be regulated inappropriately. While investment certainty is important, experience with the growth of broadband in the EU since 1995 demonstrates that competition and not relief from regulation is the major factor driving investment. A study by SPC<a href="#defann_66_4" name="refann_66_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Network found in 2005 that broadband penetration in Europe increased by 3% for every 1% increase in competitiveness between different delivery routes (including cable, local loop unbundling/shared access and bitstream)<a href="#defann_66_5" name="refann_66_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also raises an important question of how can we best achieve competition and investment in next generation networks. In Europe today, the decision on finding the right balance between competition and investment can no longer be solely a national decision. This is a European process, and the review of the regulatory framework should not encourage fragmented national approaches which may favour only the former national incumbents and could thereby block the development of a true Europe-wide communications market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)On 30 September 2005 the Commission adopted the Communication ‘i2010: Digital Libraries’ (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0465">COM(2005)465</a>), outlining a strategy based on three main pillars: (1) digitisation of content stored in traditional formats; (2) online accessibility of this content; and (3) digital preservation – making sure that our cultural heritage in digital format will also be available for future generations.</p>
<p>The digital libraries strategy is part of the wider efforts of the Commission to foster a better use of the Information and Communication technologies for economic growth, employment and quality of life, as defined in the i2010 initiative. The digital libraries initiative demonstrates the potential of these new technologies in projects for the benefit of citizens.</p>
<p>In the four months following this Communication, discussion and work on digital libraries has gained momentum, both at national and EU level. Progress is being made in various directions, indicating that the Commission’s strategy is well supported by the different actors concerned, including Member States, and cultural institutions such as libraries.</p>
<p>The Communication was discussed in the Culture Council of Ministers of 14 November 2005, where Member States showed strong support for the initiative and endorsed the idea of a European Digital Library based on the networking of national resources and building on existing initiatives.</p>
<p>The Conference of European National Libraries (CENL), an organisation comprised of 45 major European libraries, has committed to contributing to a European digital library based on an incremental and decentralised model, with a preferred multilingual central access point for users. The Commission is contributing to these collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>A High Level Expert Group (HLG) will advise the Commission on how to deal with the challenges for realising digital libraries. It will bring together stakeholders from the cultural institutions (libraries, archives, museums), publishers, rightholders organisations and IT-firms. The HLG will be composed soon; its first meeting is foreseen for the end of March 2006.</p>
<p>An online consultation on digital libraries was launched on 30 September 2005 and closed on 20 January 2006. It has triggered more than 200 contributions, which can be found at the following site: http://europa.eu.int/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/index_en.htm</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The input of stakeholders, which is currently being analysed, will be considered in drafting a Commission proposal for a Recommendation on digitisation and digital preservation, planned to be adopted by the Commission during the current year. The Commission has also started preparatory work for the announced Communication on digital libraries of scientific information. This is an area with its own specificities and dynamics in view of the need to handle and store huge quantities of digital data, and the rapid growth of publications only available in digital form.</p>
<p>Enhanced co-funding possibilities are being made available for initiatives on digital libraries with a real European scope and added-value. € 60 million are earmarked for projects related to digital libraries through the eContentplus programme (2005-2008). A first batch of projects received under the 2005 eContentplus call for proposals is currently being selected. Finally, the Commission intends to step up its research funding in this area under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework programme for Research and Technological Development. The detailed work programme, including the proposals relevant for the digital libraries initiative, is at present being elaborated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0078"></a>

<p>(EN)An efficient investment fund business is crucial for mobilising savings for investment in the real economy and for helping households to accumulate savings for retirement. EU law in this area is restricted to allowing investment funds to be marketed in other Member States on the basis of their home country authorisation (the 'product/UCITS<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> passport'). While the UCITS passport has encountered some problems in its practical implementation, it has paved the way for cross-border sale of investment funds. However, it has not been enough to facilitate industry consolidation and greater efficiency. The European fund market is still populated by relatively small and inefficient funds.</p>
<p>The question whether the Commission should do more to enable the fund industry to better serve the European investor was at the heart of the July 2005 Green Paper. The Commission invited reactions on a range of new single market freedoms for the fund industry. These included the right of fund managers to manage a fund in another jurisdiction (management company passport); measures to allow more efficient pooling and merger of funds; and the possibility for funds to use custody and depositary services from partner country banks.</p>
<p>Responses received show a high level of interest in expanding the single market framework to include some of these possibilities. These issues are also to the forefront in preparatory discussions on the Parliament 'own initiative' report in response to the Commission Green Paper. However, feedback from industry, investors and national authorities pinpoints a number of commercial and supervisory issues that warrant further exploration. To help identify viable responses that meet these concerns in a cost-effective way, the Commission is taking a number of steps. It has asked an expert group to report on these issues in June: any recommendations will be tested with other stakeholders. The Commission has also launched two studies aiming to analyse the main challenges emerging in the asset management area.</p>
<p>All of this work will feed into reflections on any further steps that might be taken to enhance the single market for investment funds. The Commission will present its definitive conclusions on these issues in the form of a White Paper, which is expected to be adopted in autumn 2006. This could then be quickly followed by any relevant measures to enhance the functioning of the European single market for investment funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU has not allocated Cohesion Fund monies for the building of a flood prevention reservoir near Racibórz on the River Oder. This news has caused widespread dismay among inhabitants of the Oder river basin and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions. In July 1997 catastrophic flooding occurred in the Oder river basin, causing the death of 54 people and damage costing almost € 5000 million. Directly after the flooding the Polish Government set about repairing the damage. We rebuilt more than 1 000 km of dikes and increased flood water retention capacity by more than 150 million cubic metres. In implementing the programme we are working closely with our German and Czech neighbours. Poland is meeting its accession obligations as regards implementation of the provisions of the framework water directive.</p>
<p>Given the above, why has Poland not been allocated financial aid for the project and what is the likelihood of Cohesion Fund resources being made available in the near future?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)On 24 November 2005 the Directorate-General for Regional Policy of the European Commission received a request from the Managing Authority of the Cohesion Fund in Poland for co-financing for the project “Raciborz Dolny Flood Reservoir on the River Odra”. After verification, this project application was considered admissible. A letter was sent to the Managing Authority in which the admissibility was confirmed and a project number was attributed to the project (2005 PL 16 C PE 020). The co-financing envisaged from the Cohesion Fund is € 130 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Commission services are studying the application and it is foreseen that, on the basis of the project description, questions will be submitted to the Polish authorities. If these questions are answered in a satisfactory way and if sufficient financial resources are available to make the approval of this project possible during the year 2006, a Commission Decision can be expected before the end of 2006.</p>
<p>However for the environment sector, financial resources for the period until the end of 2006 are already fully committed through 88 approved projects. Therefore the availability of financial resources depends on the submission by the Managing Authority, before the end of 2006, to the Commission of a sufficient number of applications to decommit savings generated in these 88 projects. Only on the basis of these savings could the Commission approve before the end of 2006 the above mentioned project as well as 11 other projects in the environment sector for which the Commission has received admissible applications from the Managing Authority, for a total value of € 335 million.</p>
<p>If these financial resources are not made available, then the “Raciborz Dolny Flood Reservoir on the River Odra” could be proposed for Cohesion Fund financing under the Regulations of the next financial perspective (2007-2013).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0090"></a>

<p>Energy policy should also be part of regional policy.

What is therefore involved is support for energy investments on environmental grounds, improving energy efficiency, the principle of promoting energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy and the development of effective energy management systems. At a recent conference arranged by the European Parliament with delegations from the national parliaments, it came to light that there is a lack of clarity as to the priorities that the Commission is setting in this area.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission recognises the importance of energy policy action in the framework of the forthcoming period 2007-2013 for European Union regional policy. In addition to the relevant provisions set out in the draft regulation for the European Regional Development Fund, to which the honourable Member is referring to in his question, the Commission had suggested specific priorities for future European Union energy policy action through Community regional development programs in its Communication ‘Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013’<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, notably support projects on energy efficiency, promotion of low energy intensity development models and renewable and alternative technologies (wind, solar, biomass).</p>
<p>The role of the Community funding instruments are further specified in thematic Communications of the Commission, notably such on overriding political challenges for the energy policy of the European Union. Recent examples are the green paper on energy efficiency, the biomass action plan and the EU strategy for biofuels. For the forthcoming Spring European Council the Commission intends to table a green paper on a secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy for Europe, which will open the debate towards an integrated European energy policy. Then, the Commission intends developing a final Communication on energy policy later this year. Taken together, this should give further guidance for the Member States and their regions.</p>
<p>Concerning the integration of scientific research into the European Union policy, it should be highlighted that one of the objectives of the EU research policy is to contribute to the achievement of EU energy policy aims and targets as well as to help to successfully implement EU Directives at national, regional and local levels by supporting research and demonstration projects. Thus, they encompass both the development of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency addressing as well the mitigation of the environmental impact of energy production and use. Main priorities in the energy field proposed by the Commission for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Program (2007-2013) are: electricity, fuels and heat production from renewable sources, energy efficiency and savings, hydrogen and fuel cells, clean coal technologies, zero emission power generation and smart energy networks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The organisation of the national merger control system is a competence of the Member States. In this respect, it is also for the Member States to determine the degree of independence of the National Competition Authorities. Having said that, over the last 10 years, a clear evolution towards greater independence can be observed in the status of National Competition Authorities. This is something which the Commission welcomes.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also mentions the impact of mergers in strategic sectors for the internal market and the growth of the European economy, and cites as a particular example the energy sector. The honourable Member will be aware that the Commission has recently expressed some concerns about the allocation of cases between the Commission and National Competition Authorities in this context. In particular, experiences with mergers in the energy sector in recent years have shown that similar cases are sometimes dealt by the Commission and others by National Competition Authorities. It is therefore important to ensure that similar cases, in terms of their impact on the functioning of the common market, are dealt with in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the Commission has started a re-examination of the 2/3rds rule which has a direct impact on the division of competences between the Commission and Member States. According to this rule, concentrations in which each of the undertakings concerned achieve more than two-thirds of their Community-wide turnover within the same Member State do not fall into the Commission’s competence. The Commission has started to collect relevant data concerning those mergers which would have been looked at in Brussels, in the absence of the rule. It will then be possible to assess how the two-thirds rule has functioned in practice both (a) in terms of the number of cases affected, and (b) in terms of the nature of those cases. Once this fact finding exercise is concluded it will be examined whether there are improvements to the present system that the Commission could propose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
