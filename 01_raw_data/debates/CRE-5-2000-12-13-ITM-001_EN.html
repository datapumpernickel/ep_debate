<p class="contents">It is certainly important, to my mind, that we know which honourable Members have tabled which amendments. For that reason, conducting a debate without access to the amendments must remain an exceptional situation. It is an extremely unusual procedure, and what Sir Robert Atkins says is essentially correct. Unfortunately, however, we have now reached the point at which we can no longer defer this discussion. I therefore ask, Madam President, that we begin the debate, but let me put on record that this practice of conducting a debate in ignorance of the tabled amendments is a highly abnormal practice.</p>

However, a majority of the House decided that we should hold the debate today, so that is what we shall have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">When we discuss postal services, we have to speak about three things. What has surprised me slightly as rapporteur over the past few months is that we have somewhat lost sight of these three things. Firstly, we must ensure that postal services are provided at affordable prices; secondly, we must ensure that the services are of a high quality, and, thirdly, we must ensure that we are able to guarantee the availability of at least a minimum range of postal services in all parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the people of Europe rightly expect of us. To that end, we have received a proposal from the Commission in accordance with the directive which was adopted in 1997. It is a matter of examining how much monopoly is needed to achieve these aims – especially the universal availability of services – and how much competition is possible alongside such a monopoly. I have always taken the view, as far as postal services are concerned, that there should be as much competition as possible and as much monopoly as is necessary. This, I believe, is a maxim that should be taken to heart. I very much regret that the numerous studies on postal services conducted by the Commission in recent years do not give any clear indication as to how much monopoly is required for a guaranteed universal postal service. Such an indication would have made my work a little easier and would certainly have helped Parliament too. As things stand, everyone has been able to pick and choose from this wide range of studies as he or she has seen fit.</p>
<p class="contents">So what exactly is it all about? It is about the degree of monopoly we require. The Commission proposed that the monopoly service be restricted to letters weighing 50 grammes or less. At the committee stage, we agreed on a compromise, namely letters up to a weight of 150 grammes. The Commission proposed the full liberalisation of cross-border mail. We in the reporting committee agreed on a compromise, namely that the same weight ceiling should apply to cross-border mail and national mail. The Commission proposed that legal certainty be created in the realm of the so-called special services, which is understandable, given the problems that exist here, especially in the Directorate-General for Competition. We decided in committee to leave the question of special services as it is regulated in Directive 97/67/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed a review of the directive in 2004. Our committee proposed that this be undertaken one year earlier. We also agreed that the period of validity of this directive should remain unchanged. Back in 1997, at the time of the decisive vote on the last directive, I told Martin Bangemann, who was the Commissioner responsible at that time, that the only good thing to be said about the old directive was that it had an expiry date, that it would eventually lapse. I believe it is right to continue this practice, because it exerts pressure on the markets, and that is absolutely essential if we are to achieve what the people expect of us. As citizens of our countries, we pay for this monopoly every day with overpriced postage stamps throughout the European Union. The quality of the postal services has not improved over the past 500 years!</p>
<p class="contents">We have to think about all of that. It is not the responsibility of postal administrations to create jobs throughout each country, but it is their responsibility to move mail from A to B. If we just concentrate on what the core business of postal administrations is and on the need to ensure that markets are opened up judiciously and gradually – not abruptly, but gradually; the Commission went for abrupt change in its proposal, but we in the committee agreed on a different approach – then it will certainly be possible to safeguard what needs to be safeguarded.

Thus, we propose that the opening should take into account Article 16 of the Treaty, which raises the provision of traditional postal services to the category of services of general interest, given the place they occupy in the shared values of the Union and their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion, for which reason they should operate on the basis of principles and conditions that enable them to fulfil their missions.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we point out weaknesses in the draft directive, requiring that the economic and social impact of liberalisation be made known and an assessment be made of the economic effectiveness and service quality provided by the companies so that Parliament can decide with certainty and clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Without jeopardising the modernisation of all postal services and the opening to competition, Member States must continue to preserve their rural network of counter services, which help bring the remote places closer to centres of decision making and are thus indispensable to the social cohesion of the smallest urban or rural communities. The Committee on Legal Affairs has been even more demanding as regards price limits on services reserved for the universal provider, but it proposes the same 150-gramme weight limit and jointly rejects the 50 grammes laid down in the draft directive. The difference from the basic report is a simple matter of detail included within the framework of a parliamentary discussion, which, incidentally, has been extremely well conducted by the rapporteur, Mr Ferber. It is also guaranteed that cross-border mail will remain a service reserved for the postal services, and also, if VAT comes to be levied on postal services, that the tax should be levied at a reduced rate so as not to raise the price of stamps in the Community. My committee has clearly rejected the idea of special services, which, as I understand it, were aimed at draining the universal service of any profitable activities, leaving it only with services where costs outweighed prices, and it also made subject to liberalisation the so-called new services, defined as “all those that the universal service provider does not undertake or is not naturally obliged to produce”.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, there would be much more to say, but I shall confine myself to adding that only rarely has there been such political consensus on an issue among the various committees called upon to express their opinions in this Parliament. Postal services, like schools, roads, and bridges, are part of the European cultural landscape and our shared concept of civilisation. This Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and will continue to support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we have just been reminded, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has tabled a number of amendments and slight modifications to the Commission’s proposals too. As is well known, there are two conflicting visions here of what are called public services, and I hope that it will be possible to reconcile them one day. According to the first view, public services cannot be truly European unless they are transformed into markets, that is to say unless the private sector is given the infrastructures, know-how and networks patiently acquired sometimes in the public domain and, where postal services are concerned, practically always in the public domain. The second view is that, if postal services are to be opened up to competition, there must be no conflict between traditional and modern practices. It must also take place in a Europe of rights, that is to say a Europe whose citizens, and in particular, those who are in most difficulty, are assured a minimum of what may be considered essential rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the latter view should be taken of postal services for, as has just been seen, the post office is not just an ordinary public service. It is a public service in which the human and social dimensions are very important. It is a public service whose network is sometimes the last civic link with democratic institutions in difficult places such as inner cities. It is also a public service which has a notable territorial aspect to it. For all these reasons, the postal services which are now to be opened to competition and which are to a very large extent already in competition where very many products are concerned and which are themselves subject to competition from new technologies and are faced with new consumer expectations, as we are agreed, cannot be treated as a mere market. </p>
<p class="contents">As we have all agreed, it is therefore only right to talk in terms of a universal service, that is to say a service offered to everyone throughout the territory of the European Union. What is unacceptable, however, is for the cost of the service to be identical in every country, given the differences in geography and population density. What might be acceptable for the Netherlands or Malta, that is to say a reserved sector reduced to 50 grammes, may not be practicable where Greece or France is concerned because of the geography of these countries. That is why I, personally, am happy that we have compromised by setting the minimum weight/price limit at 150 grammes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the universal service should be in a position to develop. There is no reason why the service offered to people should not incorporate all kinds of technical and economic progress, and I believe that, from this point of view, doing away with special services is a step for which no clarification had first been provided. Finally, a new date for liberalisation is unacceptable until a prior assessment has been made. That has been the major misunderstanding in this debate. The Commission ought to have provided us with an impact study of the various phases of liberalisation. It has not done so. It must do so next time without fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In response to Mr Ferber and his contention that postal companies do not have an obligation to create jobs, I agree with him, but believe that we have a responsibility to create an environment where companies like postal companies can deliver a good, efficient, universal postal service and to ensure that the jobs thereby provided are good-quality jobs. That is our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">No one is arguing that there should be no change in relation to postal services. Technology and changing markets will drive change, in any event. I agree with the generally declared objective that there should be gradual and controlled change; but I disagree that the Commission's proposal is in any way controlled or in any way gradual. It seems to me that the Commission's proposal goes too far, too quickly, and that, in fact, it would devastate some national universal service providers. I know from my own experience in Ireland that the Irish postal company would indeed be devastated. Forty-six per cent of its revenue would be opened to competition. It would not be able to survive in such an environment, it could not deliver universal services in Ireland, it could not maintain the current level of local post offices in Ireland as a result of such competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to reconsider its position and accept Parliament's position. But, in particular, I urge the Member States in Council to consider their position; and I am quite concerned that despite the fact that Members of the governing party in Ireland are supporting the compromise position here in Parliament, the Irish Government is not supporting that position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You know how difficult this issue is; it is laden with ideological overtones, sometimes from both sides. We therefore owe him our thanks for rallying a large majority behind a sound compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group agrees with the Commissioner and with the Lisbon meeting of the European Council, though not that of Nice, that further steps need to be taken to open the market in postal services. Competition in the postal sector, as it has done elsewhere, will ensure that we have a more effective and an affordable service for consumers. However, my group also takes the view that we as a Community and as Member States must naturally ensure that conditions are created for the provision of a universal service too.</p>
<p class="contents">But, Mr Savary, the purpose of the universal service is to offer the postal services that people typically require and to offer them at affordable prices throughout the territory of the Member States. The purpose of the universal service is not to act as a citizens' advice bureau or to organise psychological counselling. The fact is that, in order to make a universal service possible, we are reserving a domain in which monopolies can operate. In other words, in this exceptional case we are deliberately excluding competition. But this exclusion must only apply to postal services and not to advisory services, social services or anything else. We cannot find any legal grounds for excluding competition from these other domains.</p>
<p class="contents">So, if a Member State wants to have a nation-wide citizens' advice network, it should pay for it. When I buy a postage stamp, I should not be helping to finance a citizens' advice service in France or in any other countries. That would truly make a mockery of the universal service. Yes, we do want to guarantee a universal service, and, in order to do so, we must exclude competition from a certain area of the postal services. The great bone of contention in our committee and in the House as a whole is this: how large an area do we have to keep free of competition so that a decent universal postal service can be provided? I believe the compromise ceiling of 150 grammes that we have proposed, along with the application of the other criteria, constitute suitable next steps. For this reason, a majority of my group will be supporting this compromise too.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation on the ground, of course, varies widely. Let me give you an example. The Belgian Post Office cannot claim to serve a country of vast dimensions, nor can it claim to serve a remote country on the periphery of Europe. Yet its postal services are disastrous, even though it has a reserved right to provide them. This is why we are giving the green light for the next step. May I also point out, Commissioner – and this is the second of the motions we have tabled – that we should like to have a report by 31 December on this next step that we are about to take, so that Parliament and the Council can jointly decide on further steps towards more open markets, and I also hope that you will be able to present a clear evaluation report in the year 2003, on the basis of which we can then initiate the next moves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur Mr Ferber and the members of the committee for their hard work on this particular dossier. It has not been an easy dossier to follow and it has not been rushed or done wrongly. It is excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous directive of 1997 called for: "a gradual and controlled liberalisation". What the Commission came up with during this year was neither gradual nor controlled. What it came up with was, in the words of Neil Armstrong, the famous American astronaut: "one giant leap for mankind" in that they moved from 350 grammes to 50 grammes in one fell swoop. Therefore, whilst that may be welcomed in certain parts of this House, it would have had a devastating effect on postal services throughout the European Union. This morning we need to examine what those proposals would have meant.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to make the point made by Mr Jarzembowski: so many studies have been conducted by this Commission, yet we have never seen them. A commissioner came before the committee and said that they would be put on the Internet – we never saw them! Yet we are expected to go along the lines that the Commission wanted without ever seeing those so-called studies. The reason why we never saw those studies was because the social effects mentioned in them – the effects on postal services – were simply not to the liking of the Commission. A reduction of the universal service – the very core of the postal service sector – to 50 grammes would seriously put at risk the ability of the national postal operators to deliver a universal service at an affordable tariff to people, irrespective of where they live. That is a crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not saying that people who live in cities should get a better service than people in rural areas. I am not going to give the old Florus Wijsenbeek argument: well, why should we be delivering letters up there – people should get on the Internet. That is why he is no longer with us.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, what the Commission is proposing, supported by some in this House, will in my own country lead to a reduction in service levels, in particular in rural areas. You can forget the daily guaranteed delivery and collection service. You can forget a single tariff: zonal pricing will be introduced. In other words, people in rural areas will pay more. There will be job losses. I am sorry, Mr Ferber, I am concerned about job losses and the effect they will have. It will also lead to the closure of rural sub-post offices, because they rely on postal services for their very survival.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to stress the human element. Some people have said that we have liberalised telecoms and it was not a great problem. But telecoms are about machines, this is about people meeting the service face to face, not meeting the service the other side of a telephone or computer screen. We often pontificate here about being the representatives of the citizens of Europe. Well, if my mail bag is anything to go by, the citizens of Europe do not want to see their postal services decimated.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind my Conservative MEP colleagues of the mess they got into in the UK when they tried to privatise the British post office. I fought against that and, having won that battle, I am not going to give that up to see the battle reopened via the back door of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have a report before us that is an excellent response to the Commission's proposals. It is a response that is not only measured, but also guaranteed to improve our services for consumers, irrespective of where they live. Again, I stress that what we are talking about today is people and public service and not ideologies. It is about getting that public service delivered to them, irrespective of what is on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would recommend our compromises because I believe we have ensured that postal services will be developed in the European Union and that those postal services will deliver to the people of Europe. If you go down the road of the Commission or some in this House, then you will decimate those postal services and we will be slated by the people for that action, and rightly so.</p>

Quite the reverse, in fact: I intend to make them more effective, and Mr Ferber’s report is not a sound proposal in my opinion. Some of my colleagues do not share my opinion on a number of scores, as will become evident in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought the Commission’s proposal was a sound one. It represents an important step towards an internal market, and is important for consumers and companies who use those postal services, but we closed the door on it. At this rate, we will need 100 years to bring about an open market for postal services in Europe. Mr Simpson, your predictions have, as far as I can tell, not materialised in Sweden, although that country operates an open-market system. The same holds true for the Netherlands, and when I talk face to face with other people from postal companies, they do not express these concerns either. I therefore assume that you are only voicing half-truths and saying what you like to hear.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment. At the very least, that will give us an end date. I believe that my amendment is gradual and controlled. It is not as ambitious as I would have liked, but I feel it is a sound compromise. We are now facing a peculiar situation, really. Although we go along with the postal monopolies, I notice that the German postal services are floating their company on the stock exchange, the Mecca of capitalism, and advertising in the Belgian newspapers to sell their shares because they are a profitable company. And where do these profits originate from? A monopoly. I have noticed that the Royal Mail has shares in a postal company in Sweden because over there, it can compete within an open market. But I ask you: would a Swede be able to compete in Britain? No. This is the type of situation which we want to avoid. In this case, we are on the same side as big business. They have literally laid down the law. It is a hypocritical situation, if you ask me, because these companies now have a finger in all sorts of pies and are paving the way for the free market. They are doing this very actively. They are restructuring and are making people redundant, Mr Simpson, even though they are monopolies, and I believe we are protecting those interests. We have turned the safety net for post users into a hammock for those large postal companies where they can carry on doing what they are now getting away with. I object to this practice and will vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the voices of users and consumers, the postal workers and the unions are listened to, if attention is paid to the concerns of the public authorities and of local councillors and if account is taken of the opposition voiced by a number of governments to this development, then it might well be wondered where Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposal has come from, so unrealistic and unworkable does it appear to be.</p>
<p class="contents">How was the Commission, which is supposed to represent the overall interests of Europe, able to propose a development so contrary to what is called for by the relevant players? Is there a certain kind of ultra-liberal dogmatism that makes one particularly blind and deaf? How has the Commission been able to avoid assessing the previous stage before proposing moving on to the next stage?</p>
<p class="contents">All it would seem to have drawn from the Lisbon conclusions is about how to pursue liberalisation by means of directives, while the emphatic reference to the role of services of general interest is at present reflected only in communications and statements. However, we know that guaranteeing equal high-quality access to everyone everywhere requires tariff equalisation to be maintained and a certain number of services to be kept for those providing a universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to innovation should also be guaranteed so as to take account of changing needs, the consequences of the development of the information society and the fight which may be required to ensure that no one is excluded from this society.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be logical to reverse the burden of proof rather than always have to justify exceptions to the sacrosanct principle of the internal market. It would be more in keeping with citizens’ expectations to restore the balance where public services are concerned by making any new extension to the commercial sphere conditional upon respect for the fundamental objective of the sustainable development of European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Commission’s new postal directive envisaged, in fact, the almost total liberalisation of postal services. By putting operators in competition with each other in the most profitable areas, it would lead to the closure of a large number of post offices, job losses and insecure jobs and would result in social dumping. We are given two reasons for the need for further liberalisation. Firstly, to continue the process of creating a large, liberalised European market while stating that liberalisation of this kind would create jobs. However, no one is deceived into believing that the Commission’s proposals are not part of an initiative to abolish the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reference is made to the 1997 Directive. However, if liberalisation had been such a great success, then why, in spite of the repeated requests by Parliament, has the Commission still not carried out a public critical assessment of the consequences of the first phase of the liberalisation of the sector in 1997, not only in terms of employment, but also in terms of postal rates and the number of post offices remaining throughout Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is this: as soon as it was known about, the planned new directive elicited a great many reactions. The fact is, across the range of very different approaches, the proposals made have been deemed inadmissible by a majority of players in the postal services field and also by a great many parliamentarians. Trade unionists, consumer associations and postal workers have expressed their views right here in Strasbourg. A European appeal has been launched by the MEPs in three of our parliamentary groups.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been gauged is the considerable importance people attach to their local post offices. What lies behind this concept is what it represents as an integral component in social cohesion and harmonious urban and rural planning. Social cohesion is a frequently recurring theme here in Parliament. Like a good many others, it is a term requiring some practical expression. I believe, moreover, that it is this which has made it possible to curb the most retrograde provisions of the directive proposed by Commissioner Bolkestein. Indeed, the notion of special services is eliminated by the amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and by taking account of the opinions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased about that, because this notion of special services was in any case intended to exclude new technologies from the scope of universal service. The 50-gramme weight limit proposed for the reserved sector has been increased to 150 grammes, the rates have been increased from two and a half times to four times the standard tariff and the dates from which the new directive is to apply, like the date for transposition, have been put back. I also think it important that there is no longer any reference to a new time limit for liberalisation and that there is, in addition, a formal requirement for a genuine assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third and last remark: although these initiatives are worth emphasising and represent serious resistance to the initial project, we ought not to deceive ourselves that we are not embarking upon a new phase in the liberalisation of the postal sector. That is something about which I, unlike other colleagues, was not happy. We therefore need to remain vigilant. We need to ensure that there are no harmful consequences for employment and for the post office network, or for postal rates, because we are told it is to be beneficial. However, Parliament also needs to work on determining what is required of a high quality universal service relevant to the demands of the new century within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Social and economic development is leading to an explosion in the need for information. Enabling everyone to access the various means by which information is transmitted is crucial to the economy and to society. It is not, however, possible to enable everyone to access these modes of transmission in the framework of unfettered competition. The modern economy, which was so dear to those at the Lisbon Summit, needs a modern universal service developing along lines quite different to those of the dogma of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that restraints have been placed on the initial project and yet, at the same time, the fact that a new phase of liberalisation is being embarked upon will lead me to abstain from voting on Mr Ferber’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, I hope that the broader membership of the European Parliament will accept the recommendations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism concerning the future administration of postal services within the European Union. The opening up of postal services to greater competition is one of the recommendations of the Transport Committee. However, we must recognise that unfettered competition in the area of postal services would result in a severe reduction in the quality of these services in rural and peripheral parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is recommended that universal postal providers within the Union will be able to deliver all postal items below 150 grammes in weight. This will have the effect of protecting the quality and continued regularity of postal service deliveries. Private operators will also be able to deliver letters at four times the price of a normal letter.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive. There has been absolute and total consultation between all interested parties in the field of postal services in Europe concerning the specific provisions of this directive; and I am satisfied that these proposals which have come through the Transport Committee of the European Parliament are realistic and pragmatic. They will ensure the economic viability of the rural post office network in my country and in other rural and peripheral parts of the European Union. Regular postal deliveries must be seen as an essential economic and social element in rural villages and towns.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be very clear on one particular matter. If there is unfettered competition in providing postal services in Europe, then lucrative urban areas will be cherry-picked by private operators at the expense of the poorer and less profitable rural parts. We cannot, Madam President, Commissioner, and will not, tolerate such a situation. That is why I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the Transport Committee of this Parliament with regard to the future administration and workings of postal services in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, we are benefiting from the fruit of a wise decision which will further the progress of this extremely important dossier. The Presidency undertook to deal with the issue and intended to do so before the end of its mandate. If we are able to make an effective contribution, then that will, in any case, be a step in the right direction. This is a dossier which warranted swift treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this in all sincerity, for we Italian radicals feel, on the contrary, that the Commission's proposal, put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein, makes complete sense and that it would bring about both gradual opening-up of the market to competition and, in any case, the establishing of<span class="bold"> </span>fixed<span class="bold"> </span>time frames for all operators. This proposal could not be considered to be as <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> as some say it is.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, parts of the Ferber report would appear to weaken the proposal. In fact, it provides for minimal subsequent opening-up of the market and provides absolutely no certainty regarding future steps while, as far as the universal service is concerned, the Swedish example should reassure all those who feel that privatisation will mean the end of the postal services. This is and must not become the case. We must remember that the postal services and, in general, logistics must in the coming years be one of the fundamental bases for the development of the new economy and that, if we adopt defensive tactics to protect the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, defending the major interests of monopolies and unions, then thousands of jobs will be threatened. This would be in outright contrast with the goals the European institutions set themselves in Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, protectionism is still very much alive. This is certainly the case within the postal sector. While electronic communication, such as e-mail, has enjoyed a real boom, former state monopolies are mainly turning inward. A gradual introduction of competition within the post is to be welcomed so as to acknowledge its social function. This is why the European Commission has not suggested liberalising all postal services as a second step in the process. According to Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposal, more than two thirds still remains in the hands of monopolies. But this is not enough for a dozen or so national postal companies. Backed by a massive lobby, they managed to persuade the majority of this House to adopt an even more conservative stance. It is exactly those groups which like to portray themselves as progressive who are putting the brakes on. When I then hear that the monopolists are opposed to this idea, it is like asking a turkey how it feels about Christmas dinner. The monopolists are combing the markets and buying up private companies with funds generated by the monopoly. Experience in Sweden and the Netherlands, among others, has taught us that the objections to a free postal market are unfounded. There are no remote addresses which are being excluded and employment will recover after the necessary efficiency operations. The worst decision which the European Parliament could make this week would be to abandon an end date for the second phase. If the step which the European Parliament now wants to take is far too small, let us then at least ensure that we pick up the thread in a couple of years’ time. In a climate of honest competition, monopolists can show what they are made of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is the country where the highest number of letters are delivered the day after they have been posted. Also, no other country in the European Union has such fast distribution of post from abroad. There is a connection between all of this. Even though the previously dominant national company in Sweden is still by far and away the largest, the growing competition currently from 50 other companies has meant that they have been forced to become considerably more efficient than they were before. It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me briefly to say a few words regarding the quite obvious hypocrisy also found within this sector. The British Royal Mail and the French <span class="italic">La Poste</span>, to name but two, oppose any form of competition in Great Britain and France respectively. This does not prevent both companies from wanting to get in on the act and claim a share of the market in countries where deregulation has taken place. It would, of course, be reasonable for the Commission to examine the legality of companies who refuse other companies access to their markets and yet gladly claim a share of the market in countries where deregulation has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, who has made several attempts at reaching a compromise. There should be no reflection on him, but there has been a lack of desire on the part of others. I do not consider the current draft to be a compromise. It would have been a compromise if an end-date for completion of the liberalisation had been set. If this date is set later than, for example, 2007, it will, in my opinion, be completely meaningless. By then, the market will have resolved this issue. There is therefore currently no reason to support such an amendment, and in that case I see no alternative than to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The House certainly has no problems with that. At the same time, the directive provided for the preservation of a high-quality universal service, and that is the real crux of the matter. The point is that a universal service needs to be funded, and this has been said a few times already. The Commission stated at the time that it would present studies and data and figures on the implications of the funding requirement. We are still waiting for these.</p>
<p class="contents">So there remains something of an unresolved question, namely what and how much it takes to establish and finance the sort of reserved domain that will guarantee us a good, solid universal service. It is therefore desirable that Parliament should not subscribe to the battering-ram strategy proposed by the Commission and should adhere to the strategy of controlled and gradual opening of the postal markets. And as for employment, my dear Markus, we see things differently. It goes without saying that the postal services are not a job-creation programme. But this Parliament and the European Union also have some responsibility for employment and for the social conditions in which the postal services operate. Whether the new providers create jobs and the number and quality of such jobs cannot be a matter of indifference to us, nor can the number and nature of the jobs that are to be preserved by the traditional providers of postal services. These things must also be our concern. Let me say this to Georg and Markus: when the postman calls once, or even twice, we are well aware that this is not the ultimate social service in Europe. But when grandma is happy because she has a friendly postman, which is also a factor in the quality of postal services, we should not begrudge her that pleasure but be happy with her. I should like to express my very sincere thanks to Markus Ferber, because he has shown himself very willing indeed to compromise so that we could put together a constructive proposal. This is it now – I think – and the Commission will take it from here with our wholehearted support. Provided it proposes a high-quality universal service as a dynamic blueprint for the future, the Commission will have our support, but not otherwise.</p>

I am not expressing an objection in principle to either of these but my concern, too, is with sustaining a good-quality, affordable and genuinely universal service provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak in support of the 150-gramme limit for reasons of caution. In the UK, many areas are fortunate enough to enjoy a much higher level of universal service provision than the current directive requires, but aspects of our services are already under threat, particularly post offices in rural areas. These are particularly vital in my own constituency of Scotland. No one has yet succeeded in reassuring me about the effects of the Commission proposal in both these respects, which is why I am not only supporting the 150-gramme compromise but asking for a thorough review or reviews on the effects for universal service provision before any other proposal or proposals come forward.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as has been reported, the EU is prepared to consider sport in a special way, should we not also consider postal services in a special way?

I would also like to congratulate our co-rapporteur, Mr Simpson, on his perseverance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Dutch newspapers, Mr Bolkestein recently criticised the French for adopting a non-liberal attitude, or, at least, that is how the headline in one of the newspapers read. By the same token, I could criticise the Commissioner for not really applying the Dutch consultative model to this situation and for failing to anticipate the social implications which a liberalisation proposal such as this would have. After all, you may quote facts and possibly be right in terms of what Mr Sterckx had in mind, i.e. technological development, the way in which the sector is developing, the role of state companies, the way in which the Deutsche Post has now taken over DHL, etc., but this does not mean that you <span class="italic">are</span> right. I believe that being proved right is an important matter in this House. In my view, we are taking one step back instead of forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have levelled the criticism, which I share wholeheartedly, that we did not have the impact studies at our disposal. Where it was possible to study the impact studies, it appeared that the social aspects in particular had been neglected in terms of social cohesion, employment, special services, etc. Similarly, consultation involving the social partners simply failed to meet the mark, and it is against this background that my group will most certainly support these proposals. In other words, the question is raised as to whether my group supports the deferment of liberalisation, which brings me onto another topic. In the capacity of rapporteur of the general interest services for our committee, there is no doubt that we will need to cast a critical eye over these developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree with you there. But you did forget one other criterion. Our responsibility for our national economies also obliges us to maintain a high level of employment. Because we share these values, this Commission and this committee took the decision they did, and for that I actually ought to be grateful to the privatiser and liberaliser-in-chief, Mr Bolkestein.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is so ill-prepared to enter into negotiations, anyone who fails to present the requested report on the impact of the 1997 Directive, anyone who argues from an ideological platform – "We shall achieve these very aims you have identified by liberalising, liberalising and liberalising again" – need hardly wonder when he falls flat on his face! Your original report, Mr Ferber, was very closely modelled on Mr Bolkestein's, and I must express my gratitude to you for the fact that you allowed reason to prevail in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that the compromise which is now on the table takes account of the aforementioned criteria, and I am delighted that our rejection of the general liberalisation of express services and cross-border services has now been set down in black and white. I am pleased that special services have not been redefined. I am gratified that there is no deadline for liberalisation, because the paramount aim from a national economic point of view must be to provide the population with proper postal services. I believe that a guaranteed universal service is the only way to achieve this aim in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the market or of liberalisation, but the request that was made for a systematic, professional and painstaking analysis of all the implications of the directive has not been met, and that is why I am prepared to accept the present compromise proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He states in the explanatory statement that he was forced to seek a compromise between hundreds of largely homogeneous amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, we do not feel that there is any other fair way to settle an issue which is so complex and, at the same time, so paradoxical. The complexity is caused by the implications for 15 different national situations, although all with exactly the same problems – maintaining a high-quality universal service and at least keeping levels of employment stable – and the paradoxical nature of the matter is mirrored in the contrasting elements of the reform proposed by the Commission. I would mention by way of example the time frames of the reform proposal and its entry into force, the fact that we have no knowledge of the effects of the first directive and the attractive, though groundless, observations on the future of the reform, starting with employment and its quality, maintaining an adequate universal service and the impossibility in material terms of accomplishing reform without recourse to a compensation fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain might be able to enlighten us on this matter, for it established the fund and has used it, and I would mention the uncertain legal bases of the fund, the virtual criteria used in its composition and the discretionary authorisation of its application. Moreover, the report does not mention the geomorphologic characteristics of the different countries and the<span class="bold"> </span>resulting differences in the costs of the universal service even though the categories of users are the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right, therefore, when he states that the compromise reached is the only compromise possible. Otherwise, irregular dealings would have gone on which would have been anything but transparent and above-board, with pandering possibly leading to conjuring tricks involving the special services during the transition to the private market. With regard to this, it would be as well for the Commission to conduct an inquiry to ascertain whether a private postal monopoly is not being created in Europe in the face of the process of liberalisation of the public postal monopolies, and to indicate what, in its opinion, the maximum permissible concentrations should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have yet to see an internal market topic which has caused so much misinformation, emotions and bitter reproaches to be exchanged. One of those reproaches concerns countries which are now professing liberalisation, but have not made any changes at home. According to my Spanish colleagues – and I would like to check this out with the Commissioner – Spain has transposed the 1997 Directive in its entirety, others have not done anything, and those who have not done anything would now like to take huge steps to make up the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein, the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties. Is this true, and if so, what steps have you taken? Also, I would appreciate it if you could outline exactly to what extent the old directive has been transposed in the different countries. Spain’s attitude in this matter is proving to be absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The misinformation has been about people in favour of liberalisation. They are also supposed to be against the universal provision of services as a matter of course. This is simply not true. Quite the reverse in fact: the concept of universal services is ideally suited to solve problems encountered in rural areas and areas which are difficult to access, via agreements and, if need be, compensatory funding. However, I am firmly opposed to monopolists who do not tolerate anybody on their home patch but take the liberty of making their purchases on liberalised markets. Who distributes the post in Sweden? Who can compete in Sweden on a free market? The Royal Mail, which Mr Simpson takes such an indulgent attitude towards. He has tabled an amendment on the public/private relationship. But to be absolutely certain that nobody could take this amendment further, he only submitted a recital and not an article. Fortunately, there is a directive in place which prescribes transparency for public companies, and I can assure you that gross subsidies will be monitored at very close range. No more public money to spend within liberalised markets. Go and play on your own turf. I trust the Commissioner will promise that he, together with Commissioner Monti, will exercise extra vigilance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with one last observation. I am extremely disappointed at Parliament’s conservatism. We are voting tomorrow, and I hope the amendments by Mr Atkins or Mr Sterckx will be adopted, otherwise I will have no choice but to vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I make no bones about the fact that, as a Greek, I had – and still have – acute cause for concern because some of the European Commission's proposals, if they are implemented, will hit the universal postal service in Greece very, very hard, not in the densely-populated areas, but in the remote mountain villages and on the small, remote islands. This, of course, does not only apply to Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, the rapporteur accepted a number of views which, if they prevail, as we hope they will, do much to improve the situation. Crucial issues such as the 150-gramme limit rather than the derisory 50 grammes proposed by the Commission, a price four times the basic standard tariff, rather than the two and a half times proposed by the Commission and the express service are handled much more realistically in the report, as are cross-border postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">On the last point in particular, I was most impressed by the European Commission's arguments, based as they are on the low average ratio between cross-border postal services and total mail volumes in each Member State. It is extremely unscientific to use the average as an indicator when there is such a wide spread between the figures used to calculate it. For example, in the present case, a country with a much lower than average ratio will obviously not have any problems, while a country with a much higher ratio will despair if it has to liberalise cross-border postal services as Mr Bolkestein proposes. In other words, it is like calculating the average income of the richest and the poorest person, which of course gives a perfectly satisfactory figure per se but can hardly be deemed to be socially acceptable to the poorest person.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish, having congratulated and thanked the rapporteur, by expressing the hope that Mercury, the winged messenger of the Gods, will continue to fly to the most remote inhabited points and that the knock on our door in the morning will herald either the milkman or the postman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that Mr Simpson has been to Sweden and to Norrland, which is one of the ‘worst’, but most splendid, sparsely-populated areas in the whole of Europe. You do not appear to have learnt anything, and you do not appear to have listened to the arguments that were put to you. I have many reports which you may read and in which you will find reasons why liberalisation is so important and such a good idea. The Royal Mail competes with other companies and delivers letters to me in Malmö in Sweden. This, in my opinion Mr Simpson, is a good thing. In this way I get a better and cheaper service.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal is a good one, but it is not sufficiently liberal. The text of the report takes the wrong line. The postal service monopoly must be abolished. The interests of consumers are best served in a market with free competition. We know this. This, of course, also applies to the postal market. Why should other conditions prevail in this market? The rapid technical development and the requirements placed on postal companies to adapt their activities quickly make an end-date for the abolition of the monopoly necessary – as early a date as possible. I personally think that 2007 is much too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the Swedish postal service was completely liberalised as early as 1993. At that time, I was a member of the Swedish Parliament and was involved in taking that decision. The Swedish Post still has 95 per cent of the market share in Sweden. In order for private postal deliverers to have a reasonable chance of establishing themselves in the market, it is therefore necessary for them to capture a large share of the market, i.e. for the market to be competitive. We in this House must give the postal market a chance. These are new times, Mr Simpson. I would like to say: “Learn from Mr Blair.”</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say that the postal service in Sweden has not deteriorated, in some respects it has even improved. The costs are not higher than in other countries. If we do not do something about the postal service now, it will be even worse in a few years. Consumers will lose out, employees will lose out, Europe will lose competitive strength and growth. Good luck, Mr Bolkestein! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is being destroyed is the very spirit of local public service, universally appreciated and respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore regard this important phase of examining this directive as a manifestation of the agreement and the bond between Parliament and the citizens of Europe. We have been able to find a majority of MEPs to respond to the questions and challenges it raises, as well as the fundamental risks it poses for the images of our various countries, the identity of our public services and the cohesion of our societies. In this connection, I would thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as well as Mr Simpson for the result that has been achieved. I am all the more grateful due to the fact that my own group has distinguished itself in this counter-offensive.</p>
<p class="contents">We had joined together in firmly denouncing these liberal excesses and their harmful effects on the territorial, economic and human fabric of our Member States. As a Frenchwoman, I am only glad that I have no part in the dismantling of that reassuring and life-affirming network of 17 000 post offices and sub-post offices, knitted together over 550 000 km2 of our territory and embodying public service for our citizens, in both suburban and rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate on postal services is also a warning to the Commission. It will have taught them that impartial and objective studies prior to the issuing of directives ought to be the rule and that, because economic liberalisation does not in any way constitute progress if it is synonymous with social dehumanisation, the notion of general public service ought to be preserved. Account ought also to be taken of indicators to the contrary, such as the liberalisation of postal services in Sweden, and of subsidiary aspects such as the quality of post office jobs and the symbolic value of the post office. In the light of this, I entirely support the compromise proposed by Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The governments which brought this about were not Socialist, but Conservative or Liberal. They only made this decision after it transpired that private companies were unable to guarantee a swift, regular, steady, affordable and universally deployable service.</p>
<p class="contents">The radical reform which the Commission proposed at the beginning of this year is threatening to turn the clock back by two hundred years. Why should we impose that model which is now being tested in the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland on the entire European Union as a permanent measure? Apparently, the proposal is founded on an ideological principle, namely that companies should no longer be publicly owned. If this is the case, then not only banks, chemical companies and steel companies must be privatised, but also public utility companies such as the energy supply, public transport and the postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the proposal aims to create a great deal more space for competing private companies, without waiting for the promised evaluation of the effects previous liberalisation decisions have had. On the other hand, the proposal would mean that the position of a group of interested companies which benefit from the wholesale liberalisation of the postal company would be strengthened from 2007 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed liberalisation has sweeping implications for the services in rural areas, for employees of postal companies and for private users of the post. It ultimately means that there will be fewer post offices, the service will slow down and the post office will no longer be able to provide the social services functions. Nor let us not overlook the higher rates due to the fact that different service companies will operate alongside each other. This translates into longer hours and less job security for the staff.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unlikely that the planned protection of the universal provision of services by means of a compensatory fund, as a result of which private profits are ploughed back into public services, will last. Fledgling companies could in future cite this restriction in their freedom as grounds for filing a complaint on account of improper government intrusion and distortion of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is positive that a majority of this House now refuses to take matters as far as Commissioner Bolkestein proposed at the beginning of this year. This has my support, but it would also be preferable if mail between 150 and 350 grammes remained in the hands of the existing postal companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Postal services are of immense socio-economic importance and have always played a key role in social cohesion. The current proposals have been the subject of very emotional debate right across the Union, particularly in my own rural constituency, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent the constituency of Connacht Ulster in the west and border counties of Ireland, which is predominantly rural and one of the most peripheral regions. The Commission's proposal to liberalise the postal services has been discussed intensively across the length and breadth of my constituency from Malin Head to Connemara and from the outskirts of Dublin to the islands. It was evident to me when the proposal first appeared that it would never be acceptable in the shape in which the Commission presented it. Parliament – which is the institution best placed to reflect the views of the citizens of Europe – made this clear to the Commission and the Commissioner even before he was appointed by us.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, the Commission chose to ignore the view expressed by the vast majority of Members of this House from various Member States and political groups. I sense a clear consensus amongst Members that this directive must address the very real concerns of citizens for the future of a viable post office network.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Commission opted instead to bulldoze ahead with the ideological proposal that fails to pay attention to the views of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to commend the rapporteur on a very fine report: a report that reflects the views of the vast majority of the Members of this House and, indeed, of practically all citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His task was made difficult by the complexity of the subject and further complicated by the limits of the Commission's proposal and the delays it suffered. These limits and delays also contributed to a debate in which the ends are often confused with the means.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree on the fact that we need a high quality service with the lowest possible tariffs for the consumer. It appears that we all agree – and this is my personal opinion – that the lever of competition and of a progressive, gradual liberalisation is also useful for this purpose, but that it is not the end: it is the means to the end.</p>
<p class="contents">If we think that we can put liberalisation forward as the solution to all the problems, then we are wrong, also because it would be a mistake in this sector not to recognise the need, which exists and which cannot be denied, for a universal service and for the guarantee that running the services will also provide the necessary means to cover the additional costs of the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions that we should therefore be asking are rather: how great a monopoly is necessary in order to guarantee the provision of these means? We therefore need to have access to the studies and analyses, which differ from State to State and from country to country in order to guarantee the achievement of this objective. How can we make it possible for the services and industrial management, inside as well as outside the reserved area, to restore quality in order to reduce the reserved area necessary to guarantee those means? This will mean removing the definition of special services which, paradoxically, would prevent the operator of the reserved area from upgrading its services.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, in future, the Commission will present to us studies and more comprehensive proposals as alternatives to those which have thus far constrained and limited our debate. I will back unconditionally not the compromise, but Mr Ferber's recommendations, for I feel that they are the only recommendations possible under the current conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must congratulate Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson on the excellent work they have carried out and which we are able to consider this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Spanish experience, which has been mentioned a few times, I believe that Parliament’s amendments improve on the Commission’s proposal because it introduces moderation – strict moderation – into the pace of opening up and liberalisation. We all agree on the need for this opening up and liberalisation, but the pace is important.</p>
<p class="contents">One message went completely unnoticed at the Nice European Council, and I think it is also close to Parliament’s position, which is that services of general interest must be taken clearly into account and be clearly favoured.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the service we are considering faces fierce competition from the new information and communication technologies. That competition cannot be considered in current terms, because the use of those technologies is undergoing a dramatic increase and we therefore have to view the issue with a little perspective. This sector is already suffering from enormous competition from those new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have included the special services in the directive itself, and I believe that Parliament has given them the added value that they must have because, otherwise, the Commission’s proposal could become a back door through which the services of general interest could be attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in dealing with this issue we are talking about economic and social cohesion. It is very important to understand that it is not only the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds that have the task of defending economic and social cohesion; it is all the Union’s policies, as laid down in Article 158 of the EC Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that the final solution is acceptable because it reconciles the need for competition with liberalisation and, most importantly, with the obligation for a universal service, and we know that there will be subsequent stages which will make it possible to assess the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcomed the fact that the reference to postal services in rural areas was accepted in committee. It was no coincidence that I tabled an amendment which also mentions the problems of mountains and islands. I am making particular reference to mountainous areas, even though they do not always fall within the definition of rural regions, because, observing the development of the postal system in many European countries, the question of mountains is now one of the most difficult matters to resolve. If we were to analyse the data already available to us, we would probably discover that a great deal, hundreds, maybe thousands of post offices have been closed in mountainous areas. Clearly, over and above the evaluations of the economic quality of the system which always have to be carried out, the real risk is that the mountainous areas will become marginalised, and new solutions therefore have to be sought which make it possible to maintain an essential service such as the postal service, enhanced by other services. In my opinion, this will be one of the major issues affecting the development of the European mountainous areas in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The effects of the first directive have not been made public, for the consequences are obvious: job losses and poorer working conditions, public services of varying quality throughout Europe, especially in rural areas and working class districts. A few large private groups will cherry-pick and divide up amongst themselves those profitable sectors of post office activity which the European Union is still preparing to offer them.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, a self-styled ‘soft’ version of the Commission’s liberalising proposal is offered to us, particularly in connection with the price-weight threshold of 150 instead of 350 grammes. The gradual, controlled liberalisation presented by the French Presidency as a lesser evil is a hypocritical way of handing an essential public service over to a market which is neither controlled nor controllable, as has already been done in the case of France-Télécom.</p>
<p class="contents">When the left-wing coalition cites realism in an attempt to obtain a compromise solution with a right-wing party, it is a way of disguising its own capitulation to private interests.

<p class="contents">But why has it been difficult? Because it is based on a Commission proposal which I believe was rotten from the outset. And why was it rotten from the outset? Commissioner, please allow me to say that you know perfectly well, because the studies that you have at your disposal show that, for example, in Spain 44% of the postal service is liberalised. And the proposal you are making in fact moves towards liberalisation. But whom does that liberalisation benefit? It benefits those companies and those countries which so far have done absolutely nothing. Actually, they have done something. They have massively financed their public postal service companies and now, rationalised, financed, with enormous economic power, they intend to enter the rest of the European Union’s postal service markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, those that have worked within the framework of the 1997 Directive are being penalised and those that have done the opposite are benefiting, and that is not a liberalised market or a process of homogenisation. That is not the construction of a cohesive and social Europe, as has been said previously. We have to seek equality of opportunity; we have to seek a legal framework and a liberalising framework, within which we all have fair and balanced opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This compromise, to which Mr Simpson and other Members also contributed seminal work, succeeds in taking into account the fact that, for the entire European field but particularly for the users who live in rural, peripheral, sparsely populated or disadvantaged urban regions, the postal services represent a fundamental link, a fundamental means of connection. Moreover, the fact cannot be ignored that the sector employs almost two million people. It is therefore right to proceed along the road to modernisation and efficiency, and there is no doubt that the liberalisation process which is already underway can also bring these results. We want liberalisation but not blind liberalisation. The process must continue according to the time frames and procedures which are appropriate to the complexity of the problems and do not affect the area of services of general interest, which are an essential cornerstone of social and territorial cohesion. Therefore, my advice to you, Commissioner, is, to quote a well-known Manzionian phrase, ‘Forward ... but carefully’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal provides for gradual further opening and will, in my opinion, surely lead to better services for the consumer at a more competitive price. As I understand it, this was the rapporteur’s initial view too, and his proposals were constructive. However, the compromise proposal which was submitted by the two large parties to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at the eleventh hour and brought about without the help of the Liberal Group, does not accommodate this view.</p>
<p class="contents">I, with many others this morning, continue to be in favour of restricting the reserved area down to 50 grammes. This is more than enough to support the public tasks, such as adequate universal provision of services and a uniform rate. The line of the compromise that 150 grammes should be four times the basic rate is not only over the top, it is also harmful to further liberalisation. I fear that this will mean that the present monopolists can further strengthen their position on the back of the taxpayer and that the threshold for newcomers will be raised quite a bit. But my key objection must be the lack of decisiveness. This is evident from the compromise proposal from the two largest parties. If according to them, the time is still not ripe for further opening, surely we should be able to make the necessary preparations so that the market can be further opened up? This means that an end date must be provided. The pressure is on. I welcome a review in 2003, but it must lead to the next step: complete liberalisation by 2007. The postal services are ready for it, so is the market, and the customer wants efficient, high-quality and affordable services. The Commission proposal accommodates these requirements, but the rapporteur’s compromise proposal does not, which is why I reject it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe in the need for liberalisation, competition and value for money. It is iniquitous that the Royal Mail in Britain is using taxpayers' money to intervene in continental liberalised markets whilst at the same time fighting to prevent that liberalisation in the United Kingdom. That is why I have re-tabled some of the amendments which we discussed in committee and which we will be voting for – especially in relation to the liberalisation of direct mail. That is essential for the development of the direct marketing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We have concerns, also, about the increase back to 150 grammes from the 50 grammes that we believe is necessary. We have, alongside this, an absolute commitment to the universal service obligation. If it can be done in rural Sweden then it can be done in rural Britain without any great difficulties. I do not take any lessons from the Labour Party about the rural areas. When I was the Minister for the Environment in Britain I was responsible for producing a rural White Paper, which dealt with some of the problems relating to rural post offices, so I do not take messages from the Labour Party, however nicely spoken by Mr Simpson.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad to see that our continental Liberal friends are giving the lead to British Liberals. British Conservatives support Commissioner Bolkestein and we intend to consider, in the course of this debate – and subsequently as the debate proceeds and as the amendments are considered – whether we will vote against the further compromise, however much I respect and regard Mr Ferber's report as a compromise in the face of many difficulties. But, because we believe that Commissioner Bolkestein's original operation is much the best, we may well decide to vote against the further compromise in order to maintain those original proposals. It remains yet to be seen. We should consider it at the end of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Sweden the Post Office went from profit to loss. Swedish Post lost jobs. Sub-post offices closed down. Prices for posting a letter in Sweden are 30% higher than they are in the United Kingdom. And if I may now turn to the United Kingdom, privatisation of the Post Office in the UK was blocked because public opinion simply would not tolerate it.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find outrageous is for the Commission to propose privatisation through the back door. But what is really inexcusable is for the British Conservatives to support the European Commission's plans to decimate our postal system in the United Kingdom. It will be a triple blow to Britain and a triple blow in particular to rural Britain: an end to the daily delivery and collection; an end to the uniform price – people in rural areas will pay more for their post; and third and finally, an end to our extensive and excellent network of rural sub-post offices.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal directly to the British Conservatives. Maybe do not listen to us, but listen to the Women's Institute in the United Kingdom, listen to the Council for the Protection of Rural England, listen even to the Countryside Alliance. All of them are backing Mr Simpson and opposing your party's views on this matter.

Commissioner Bolkestein's proposals were regrettably a bridge too far. I certainly recognise that there is nothing wrong with the concept of liberalisation <span class="italic">per se</span> and that it can bring benefits to consumers. However, it also brings certain obligations – particularly the need to guarantee universality of services. This would not have been the case with the original proposals. While they would have worked in highly urbanised countries, they spelt disaster for rural countries like Ireland. In exposing somewhere between 46 and 48% of the revenue of An Post to competition, it would have created serious doubts for the long-term viability of the Irish postal service as we know it. The cherry-picking that would have ensued would have jeopardised the ability of An Post to deliver daily and universally at reasonable cost. Furthermore, the ability of our national postal service to cross-subsidise our rural post office infrastructure would have been put in serious doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the amended report that has emerged from the committee. It is indeed a balanced compromise and I hope that it will be accepted by the Council. Let me say this to An Post: if this happens, you will have been given a valuable breathing space. Use it to develop and invest in Ireland's rural post office system. There are many possibilities apart from the one-stop shop where all government services are available to the local community, such as e-commerce and the Internet. Do not take the short-sighted easy option of allowing the rural post office system to die. It is a decision that you will regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was justified because it is in keeping with the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union which prioritise the establishment of the internal market through the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment. Justified too, since 1990, by the positions successively adopted by the European Councils devoted to this sector. Justified, finally, by the Lisbon European Council which, a few months ago, asked for this process to be speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">It was expected, too, because the Commission was behindhand in implementing the commitments specified in the 1997 Directive. However, the European Commission’s and Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposals have unleashed quite a commotion. These proposals were logical enough, however. What an outcry, though! The compromise proposed in Mr Ferber’s report lags way behind the European Commission’s reasonable proposal, which is very modest – too modest, I fear – given the need for modernisation of the European economy. And when, this morning, I see the whole of the European left wing congratulating Mr Ferber, I remain very sceptical about this compromise. At this rate, it will be 60 years before the internal market has been completed in the area of postal services. What temerity, but, above all, what a delay!</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot therefore help but draw a parallel with the outcome of the recent Nice European Council. In the run-up to Nice, there were great proposals and noble ambitions. At the Nice Summit itself there were great speeches but, at the end of the day, little was achieved. In the same way, the great flights of rhetoric, here in this debate, on the need to build the new Europe do little to conceal the faint-heartedness and conservatism that exist. All we can now do is hope that, one day, we shall be able to move on from the present stasis and give real impetus to the European project by overcoming the various forms of self-aggrandising corporatism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are some amendments, in particular those which emphasise the importance of the universal service and of the rural post offices, which I can support. Universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and everything we do is designed to create a proper climate for its improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to most amendments, however, I must say that very little is left of the original proposal, which the Commission presented in May. The Commission proposed a step-by-step approach, with a further stage of market opening of 20% overall to be taken in the year 2003. What I see in return is not only a rejection of this degree of market opening but also of the dynamic process of modernisation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly do I see? Firstly, no 50 grammes, which goes against the need to create actual competition. Secondly, no opening of outgoing cross-border mail although this is already a reality in ten Member States. Thirdly, no definition or special services contrary to the existing directives' objectives and also contrary to the case law of the Court of Justice. Fourthly, no opening of express mail, even though this is a new and separate market. Fifthly, no step in the year 2003, which is contrary to Article 7 of the current directive, and sixthly, no timetable for further reform, which goes against the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit and the needs of the operators themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a positive way forward. In particular, whereas the Heads of State and Government at Lisbon called for an accelerated market opening, the amendments which I have just now described would result in the opposite, namely a decelerated market opening. The two years' delay in implementing the next step would not be consistent with the current directive. The debate about modernising the postal sector started in 1989 during a Telecom Council at Antibes. Look where we are now, more than ten years later. Only 3% of the letter market has been liberalised. Shifting the next step from 2003 to 2005 would be another delay that, I am afraid, is not acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The degree of market opening as now proposed by Parliament would reduce the 20% of the Commission proposals to only 6% from the start of the year 2005, without any prospect of completion of the internal market in the postal sector and that, I am afraid, does not comply with the conclusions of the European Council, nor would it meet the needs and expectations of postal clients, both business users and individual households. Nor would it meet the interests of the employees in the sector who want to look ahead. In short it would be too little, too late, and would bring to a sudden halt the much needed momentum for further change, gravely harming the incumbent adaptation and threatening long-term employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, stopping competition in outgoing cross-border mail would be a retrograde step, difficult to enforce by regulation and leading to complaints from competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">Special services are another very important area where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged. Under the existing directive the principle is clear. New and distinct services are always outside the reservable area but there is no clear definition of special services in the current directive, and that opens the door to endless debate and market uncertainty. It would be unacceptable to allow continuing litigation to determine what happens here. We need clearer definitions or else we would fail in our duty as legislators to modernise the regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that modernising the postal services sector is difficult and politically sensitive. The post office is close to people, to consumers and to employees alike. In this process of modernisation, fear should not be our guide but rather the challenge of improving the sector. If we do too little, too late, the postal sector as a whole will be in danger. It will be overtaken by technology and ignored by consumers who do not get service for their money. I am sure that many of you, and in particular the rapporteur, will agree more than politics perhaps allows you to say. I call upon all of you not to shy away from your responsibility as elected legislators to do what is required and to support a dynamic process of change.</p>
<p class="contents">May I quote three actors in this field. Firstly, the chief executive of the UK post office, Mr John Roberts, has talked about competition leading to improvements in quality and efficiency and lower prices. Secondly, the President of La Poste, Mr Claude Bourmaud, recently explained how the coming decade will herald the most profound transformation ever for postal operators around the world. He said that between now and the end of the decade the opening to competition of virtually the whole postal market appears to be inevitable. Thirdly, French Senator, Gérard Larcher, who is a well-known expert in the field of postal services, called upon all parties to look forward. In 1997 he said, and I quote: “We should not deal with the problems of today by focusing on the notions of yesterday. Let us open the debate to solve the problems of La Poste in the framework of tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="contents">All three of these people make important points. The postal service is increasingly having to compete in the wider communications market with modern technology developed by the Internet, mobile telephones and the integration of different means of communication. The traditional post offices with their rigid structure of employment and slow adaptation to market requirements will not be able to compete in those markets if they are held back by Parliament's amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Society demands a modern postal sector. May I point to the main European consumer organisations, such as the BEUC, which have welcomed the Commission's proposal. Many consumer organisations would want to move even faster than the Commission in opening the postal market because they expect greater competition to lead to higher service quality and lower prices, but the Commission has not proposed this fast-track liberalisation as preferred by consumer organisations. Our proposal strikes a careful balance, because universal service providers will need time to change the structures further, to become more flexible enterprises so they can adapt to new market conditions. Only the introduction of real competition in a controlled and progressive way, according to a fixed timetable, will assist them to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European legislator fails, those Member States progressing rapidly down the road indicated by the Lisbon Summit will be penalised, as their postal operators will be subject to competition from operators benefiting from an extended monopoly. Most of the amendments adopted by Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism would, if accepted, lead to a situation where hardly anything would change. This would mean that postal services would increasingly lose ground to other means of communication. It would be a very short-sighted approach. It would be a rearguard battle. The monopoly of postal services would cause them to ossify and lose volume which would lead to losses of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of your concern about preserving the universal service and the postal network and I share this concern. I stand for cast-iron guarantees that universal service obligations will always be protected. Where we differ is the method to achieve this goal. Trying to preserve this <span class="italic">status quo</span> and maintaining the structures of the past is not the right way. The market requires flexibility and adaptability to the new communications environments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal responds to this requirement in a very reasonable and a gradual way. It recognises that under the existing directive there was already a shift in the balance between the reserved area and other means to ensure a high-quality and enduring universal service. These include licensing requirements, including universal service obligations for new entrants to the market, a compensation fund and setting tariffs at an appropriate level geared to costs. However, without competition, the situation would become unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, I can accept those of your amendments which are non-contentious and others which rightly give emphasis to issues such as universal service as applied in Member States, redressing complaints, and the rural network. These concern Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 7, 24, 28, 29, 32, 39, 40 and 41. I can also accept the new amendments tabled yesterday, namely 46, first paragraph, 58 and 59, which clarify certain important points. Regarding Amendments Nos 60 and 61, I can agree with the principle of completing the internal market at a future date to be determined within a reasonable time frame. That is all in line with the Commission's proposal and the conclusions of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it will not surprise Members of this Parliament that the Commission cannot accept the remaining proposed amendments. The reason is that they go against the grain of what the Commission has proposed – what is necessary to achieve the process of modernisation to the benefit of postal consumers and employees alike. We must maintain the momentum for change and achieve a solid first step, plus a timetable for further change.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Union cannot afford to give uncertain signals in such an important area. That is why I cannot and will not be silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a failure to meet properly the challenges set to us all at Lisbon. If the European Union, of which the Members of this Parliament are the elected representatives, wants to have the most competitive, knowledge-based and dynamic economy in ten years time, it needs a modern postal sector. Therefore, I would call upon all the Members of this Parliament to support the European mission and I conclude by saying that the time to act is now.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are trying hard to carry out modernisation and gradual liberalisation, and we do not deserve to be lectured here by you, Commissioner. You should at least thank us for taking our decision today, because this will enable you to find out in December whether the Council adheres to the line taken by the Lisbon European Council and decides in favour of your version of liberalisation, or ours. But to lecture us and then achieve nothing in the Council is a slightly hypocritical course of action, Commissioner. You really ought to listen to the majority of this House.</p>

On the other hand, I have the feeling that the Commission will be failing in its job if it did not give just as honest an opinion as Parliament in reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this whole matter will be discussed at a Telecom Council next Friday. The Commission will put forward the same opinion and therefore the Council will act on the Commission's proposal as it sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, if Heads of State or Government decided in Lisbon that the European Union should be the most competitive place in the world in ten years' time, then we have to act upon that. If Members of this Parliament are of the opinion that whatever Heads of State or Government say is of no concern to them, that is not an attitude that I share.</p>

<p class="contents">I take the conclusions expressed by the Heads of State or Government as being the guidelines for the Commission and I have spoken this morning in the spirit of those conclusions.</p>
