Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for his constructive and very close cooperation over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Czech Republic’s successes over the last few years are beyond dispute. There are still deficits in some areas, however, on standards in food-processing establishments, for example. Our consumers need have no fear, however; nothing that fails to meet our standards will be allowed in the EU internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem that has increasingly been brought to my attention recently is the suspected trafficking in human beings and in particular children at the German-Czech border. The Czech Government should be encouraging victim support programmes here. There is also a need for training programmes for the police and border guards to increase awareness of the issue of people trafficking and there should be greater cross-border cooperation on the basis of INTERREG.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the plans for barrages on the upper reaches of the Elbe are concerned, I have managed to persuade the EU Commission that an environmental impact assessment for this project is absolutely essential and that intermodal alternatives must be worked out. I live in the Elbe valley in Saxony, which was flooded in summer 2002, and I know what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to talk about the Czech parliament’s intention of honouring the former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have spent years dealing with the matter of the Beneš decrees here in Parliament and I found a compromise formula that was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the plenum in April last year, I find it insensitive and provocative of the Czechs now, just before the country is to join the EU, to be passing a law that not only evokes the past but actually honours it. I do not want anyone who supports this law joining my Group in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was very interested in Estonia even before I became this Parliament’s rapporteur for its accession, and I have visited it regularly for 11 years. I am therefore firmly convinced that we are not just being polite when we say in the report that ‘the European Parliament stresses the determination and continuity in efforts made by the Estonian authorities in carrying out the preparations for accession throughout the whole period of transition’.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see – now he has just gone out – I could see former foreign minister Toomas Hendrik Ilves in the House and I would like to thank him on behalf of all our other Estonian colleagues, for that determination, which was shown by all political camps in Estonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Impressive personalities, like – among others – the former President Lennart Meri, or Mart Laar, who was twice Prime Minister, have done much in the past to point the country towards Europe. I am convinced that with the EU’s support the country’s dynamism, which is seen especially in Tallinn, will also accelerate economic and social development in other, more remote parts.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Russia, Mr Brok has already said something about the border treaties, and I would like to add that it must also be clear that the EU’s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia applies equally to all the new Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking for clear answers from the Council of Ministers when on 5 March Russian minister Sergei Ivanov repeats the USSR’s – and sadly also today’s Russia’s – propaganda lie in <span class="italic">Le Figaro,</span> ‘<span class="italic">que l'URSS n'a pas envahi les pays baltes, mais a été appelée à l'aide</span>’ – that is, that the USSR did not invade the Baltic countries, but was summoned to their aid.

Satisfying though this is, it is overshadowed by the fact that, at the present time, the application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>is still in abeyance in the occupied sector of the island and that talks between the communities seem at present to have become deadlocked.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental cause underlying this deadlock is the fact that the principal negotiator for the Turkish part of Cyprus, Mr Denktash, is as yet unwilling to concede, or unable to grasp, despite the Annan plan, that Cyprus is an independent and indivisible country. It can join the European Union only subject to the condition that it should adopt a constitution conferring upon it a single international personality and functioning federal institutions. As is, unfortunately, confirmed by his recent statements rejecting the Annan plan, Mr Denktash’s strategy cannot be intended to do other than lead to a breakdown of bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fortunate that the UN plan includes two compensatory mechanisms. The first is the plan for Greece and Turkey to intervene in the bilateral negotiations on 22 March. This will give Turkey the opportunity to remove what is, according to the Commission, a serious obstacle to its own prospective accession, namely the absence of a solution to the Cyprus problem. The referendum on 22 April could provide a second safety net in that, if the majority of Turkish Cypriots vote in favour of the Annan plan and of accession, the ghosts of the past can be banished to the archives of history.</p>
<p class="contents">The days ahead will be crucial to Cyprus’ future. The European Parliament agrees with Commissioner Verheugen, and can do no other than hope that the people of Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish, will seize this historic opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They expected the monitoring report to praise the successes of the alignment process. That is not its purpose, however. Its purpose is to analyse the problems of direct and indirect relevance for coexistence within the European Union, so that integration into the European Union can be a success for all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased that the Latvian Government’s representative in Brussels and the country’s former chief negotiator considers my work thorough and sound and has confirmed to me that the report correctly identifies the country’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would at this point like to express my thanks for the intensive discussions with the embassy and other ministries and state bodies. The information they provided helped me to gain a realistic picture of the situation in the country. I would also like to thank my colleagues for their close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the Commission, I found that the work of the new Corruption Prevention Bureau can be described as effective and promising. I am convinced that it will enable Latvia to overcome its negative image.</p>
<p class="contents">When I visited the country, I also met a committed minister of justice, and I am convinced that with her the reforms are in good hands and will bring success quicker than assumed in the Commission report. I can say the same about agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also pleased to find that my report triggered a political debate about what is probably the country’s greatest social problem, how to better integrate the Russian-speaking population. The debate surrounding my report included a discussion of how citizenship can be achieved for what amounts to one fifth of the population and how the process can be speeded up. I have borne patiently the accusations, condemnations and insults that have been hurled at me recently in the hope that the debate on my proposals, which after all were backed by the Council of Europe, would have a successful outcome, that is result in higher figures for naturalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what some Latvian politicians are claiming, the content of my report and the things that it calls for are identical to those of other European organisations. We cannot accuse the Council of Europe and the OSCE High Commissioner of belonging to a particular political family. It is of course true that in my report I did not satisfy the heroic national pretensions of part of the country’s political elite that considers itself infallible. That was not my aim. I wrote this report with a sense of responsibility to the common values of our European Union. These include the indivisibility of human dignity and I stand by that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we arrived in the summer of 1999 at the start of our term of office, we arrived together with the Helsinki decision marking the unification of the procedure for integrating the new countries, the single wave. Today, as our term of office nears its end, this circle is being successfully closed and this is something which is very, very serious and important for the whole of Europe. The two months left are little time. Today we are exercising our criticism of the new countries as colleagues, not as observers and advisers. In this sense, I, as the official rapporteur for Lithuania, wish to confirm the important positive job which has been done in this country and helped it progress, so that in two months it will be in a position to become a fully fledged member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems, as in all the new countries. However, serious problems have been resolved, such as, for example, the issue of Kaliningrad, relations with the Russian Federation, the problem of the nuclear power station in Ιgnalina and the problem of regional cooperation. What do we need to do? We need to support this effort. To support environmental issues, to support the strengthening of the trans-European networks in the field of energy and in the field of transport, so that these countries are integrated more fully into the European structures.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have another identity (I am from an island in the Mediterranean, Crete), it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to mention the integration of the European Union in the Mediterranean with Cyprus and Malta. This circle is closing and it is closing in an exceptional manner. I hope, on the basis of what the Commissioner said to us earlier, that the relevant position of the European Union is constant, so that when Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union and the Cypriot question has been resolved, which we hope it will, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>can be applied 100% to all policies in the whole of reunited Cyprus.</p>

We must, however, recognise that the historical step of enlargement raises legitimate questions and fears on both sides in view of the challenge of reuniting two worlds which have, unfortunately, in recent decades reached very different stages of development. These will inevitably accentuate the differences between wealthier and less prosperous regions and will lead to an increase in the population living in the less disadvantaged regions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have to accept that. It is also true, however, that the step to be taken in May 2004 is of the greatest political significance, in that it powerfully demonstrates the vitality of all the countries of Europe involved in enlargement when they are faced with the challenge that history has set for them.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope is, Mr President, that from that moment onwards we shall all – current and new Member States alike – have the opportunity to work together and exercise our joint responsibility in the development of the European Union. This joint responsibility implies maintaining and even strengthening the principle of economic and social cohesion. From this viewpoint, we see enlargement as a contract providing mutual benefits for both the new countries of the Union and the current ones whose income levels still justify the assignment of Community development aid. In this respect, we thoroughly welcome the draft financial perspective for 2007-2013 that the Commission has just put before this Parliament. It also implies strengthening the quality of democracy in the European institutions, where it is essential to achieve greater democratic transparency and supervision, along with greater and more effective participation by the national parliaments in the building of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, Hungary is one of those countries whose performance in preparing to join the European Union has been outstanding. It has been my duty to accompany this development closely. It is true that there are still a few problems that Hungary will have to overcome, but we are aware of its government’s determination to fulfil the commitments it has made in good time. Rather than highlighting them now, I think it would be more appropriate to underline this country’s success in recent years in meeting the challenges that it has faced and resolved to overcome. Hungary, like all the other acceding countries, will at last be taking its well-deserved place as a European Union Member State. As rapporteur for that country, I therefore call on you all to support the Brok report, which embodies years of effort and hard work and ushers in a new era in the life of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the date draws nearer, expectations become all the more realistic; enlargement will not do away with every problem at one fell swoop. Over and over again, I get letters from members of the public pointing out ways in which, contrary to the official line, Beneš decrees are to this day being applied in cases in which compensation is outstanding. The only comment I can make on this is that I would see a more sensitive handling of history and of such historical figures as Edvard Beneš as being desirable. Nevertheless, Austria is one of the countries that stand to gain most from enlargement and it is profiting, above all from strengthened trading relations with, and investments in, the Czech Republic. As its neighbours, we were strongly supportive of its accession, in the expectation that enlargement in Central Europe would bring peaceful development and economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Malta, I cannot do other than congratulate this important small Mediterranean state, situated where Europe and North Africa meet, on its decision to join the European Union, a decision now supported by all its political forces, and also on the efforts the country has made to prepare itself for the EU. When one considers the structural weaknesses of its shipyards and, in general terms, the need to convert a protected and insular economy into an open market economy, the adoption of the EU’s <span class="italic">acquis</span> was a great challenge and a major achievement for this small island state. All I can say to the Maltese people, though, is that they must have no fear that they, as a small country, will be swamped in something as large as the European Union. The appointment of Mr Borg, Malta’s foreign minister, as its Commissioner, shows the value that Malta attaches to its accession to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For someone like me who lived through – albeit in the privileged position of foreign correspondent – the hard years of the communist dictatorship and who then went back to cover Poland as rapporteur, this is an important, and I would even go so far as to say, an emotional moment. I would never have imagined in those years that Poland and the other former communist countries would have been restored to democracy and free and effective economic development in such a short space of time. I believe that this is the last time that I will talk about Poland in this Chamber and I would like to send my thanks to all those who, both here and there, in Brussels and in Warsaw – I can see Commissioner Verheugen here – have contributed to healing this wound in our continent. In addition, I hope that the Poles will fully appreciate the grandeur of the European dream. Nevertheless, I would also like to briefly mention another country: Romania. Mr Podestà is going to talk about this country shortly, in greater depth. Romania still has a long way to go, but it is doing all it can to come into line with Europe and prepare itself. We criticised Romania for its delays; it reacted by trying to put its house in order. Now of course it needs to be watched, spurred on and monitored, but it should also be encouraged, and this is why the reprobative tone which Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne used in her report was excessive. We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Podestà which move precisely in this direction, that is, constructive criticism.</p>

That concerned the recognition of foreign certificates of study, and the situation was resolved with the recent law. Today, foreign certificates are officially recognised in the same was as Slovenian certificates. There will, of course, be problems, but there is no alternative, as was rightly stated this morning by Commissioner Verheugen, the man to whom great credit is due for this enormous political and diplomatic operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovenia’s positive situation stems both from the strong consensus among the governing and opposition parties and from the scale on which the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> has been faced up to and the care and skill with which it has been tackled. Already the next objective is to enter the eurozone, an objective that, some years ago, seemed difficult when inflation was rather high, but that now seems attainable within a reasonable time, given that, at the end of 2003, inflation fell, settling at between 4% and 5%. Slovenia has, therefore, been able to reconvert some large plants – the legacy of <span class="italic">bona fide</span> socialism – into small businesses that have subsequently become relatively dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">In foreign policy, the issue of relations with Croatia remains open: there has recently been news of the Croatian parliament’s ratification of the agreement on the distribution of the assets of the succession countries of the former Yugoslavia, an agreement signed in Vienna in 2001, but until now only signed by the Croatians. Within this legally defined framework, it will therefore be easier to resolve other problems, not least that of the Croatian unilateral declaration on the exclusive Adriatic maritime environmental zone, criticised by the European Union too for being unilateral and not achieved through an agreement between all those concerned. The general climate between Zagreb and Ljubljana has, however, recently improved and the values of security, stability and prosperity to which Slovenia aspires are those of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Entry into the EU is recognition of the road taken towards modernising the country while respecting Community values and principles. Congratulations and welcome, therefore, to Slovenia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I realise that this report is not the most important one, and may be the least important of all the reports we have produced about that country over the past six or seven years. What is certain is that Slovakia will be joining the European Union on 1 May. I have monitored that country for years and there is no mistaking the progress it has made in many areas. Let this be a compliment to a small country, the last to gain its independence and whose political problems before the election of 1998 meant that it was also included late in the countries with which negotiations were taking place. Today, we are talking about the issues that have not yet been resolved and about what is yet to happen in the acceding countries before 1 May. In that respect, I share the Commission's view as far as Slovakia is concerned. It is up to the government in Bratislava to do what is necessary; if not that country will have a problem after 1 May, with all the implications that this entails. I could not agree more with what Commissioner Verheugen stated this morning: if a problem of that kind occurs, we, in the European Union, cannot resort to any compromises, but need to have the nerve to act firmly. However, I join him in hoping that the problems will have been resolved by 1 May.</p>
<p class="contents">A few general remarks should not be missing from this report. I would reiterate my concern about corruption and would encourage the government to attach high priority to continuing the fight against it. Slovakia is continuing to improve as regards its economic performance. Economic growth is respectable; unemployment is falling, but I doubt whether all Slovaks are reaping the benefits of that. Although the reforms in social security, particularly to get people on benefit back to work, are recent, they appear to impact negatively on certain groups in practice. This particularly applies to Roma in some parts of the country, particularly eastern Slovakia, where there are hardly any jobs for them. Needless to say, such a regulation will then be ineffective. This could have been one of the reasons behind the various unpleasant incidents that took place recently, such as the looting of shops. There is, in itself, no excuse for such actions; they are illegal, but I should nevertheless advise the Slovaks to study their social legislation again carefully. As Slovakia has promised to do more, and not less, for the Roma, I do not object to amendments which aim to underline this once again. I do, however, object to amendments which accept the link between the looting of shops and the problems surrounding social security. In my view, the former is unacceptable and something should be done about the latter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, old and new countries should stop thinking in a purely ethno-centric manner. Besides, the whole integration procedure, as the report makes clear, speeds up progress by these countries with reforms in their economic, administrative and political environment and this is the biggest gain for their people.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I should like to express the satisfaction of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market at the fact that these countries are aligning with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in the fields of company law, accounting rules, customs law and movements of capital and, more generally, at the noteworthy results achieved as a whole in the field of transposing legislation into their national law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I would express the Committee’s regret at the delay appearing in certain countries in the fields of trade, cross-border transactions and recognition of professional qualifications. Here it would point out that a clear message must be sent that the huge prospects opening up for their peoples are tied in with the obligations which they have with regard to the application of Community legislation.</p>

<p class="contents">As regards the nuclear power station at Kozloduy, I should like to say the following. If it transpires from the inspection carried out in November 2003, that all the recommendations of the Atomic Question Group have been carried out, the Commission can consider postponing the closure of Kozloduy 3 and 4 for a little while longer. If, however, this is not the case, the Commission needs to adhere to the agreed time schedule for the closure of units 3 and 4.</p>
<p class="contents">There is far more concern within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with regard to Romania. Despite all the Romanian Government's efforts, we have to conclude that, to this day, that country has no functioning market economy. In practice, much more is yet to be done in order to eradicate corruption and implement structural reforms in a tangible and consistent manner. Romania's route to the European Union is difficult on account of the late start to privatisation, the late reform of state-owned businesses and the fact that its investment climate still leaves a great deal to be desired. Romania’s lack of appeal to foreign investors is another reason why the rule of law should, as a matter of urgency, be further developed in the area of Romania's economy. It is necessary to create a culture in which responsibility is accepted and laws applied. We therefore very much welcome the proposal in the Brok committee's report for a re-orientation exercise and, at the same time, for more attention to be given to problems relating to the rule of law. There is also a need for core sectors such as energy, mining and transport to be restructured. All in all, Romania still has a huge effort to make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that all those countries have made unbelievable efforts to make progress in the social sphere on various fronts. They have a number of trump cards which they can play and about which far too little is known, certainly in our countries, where people often think that the new Member States are still at an early stage of development. Needless to say, that is not the case. For example, the population is very well educated: 88% of 20 to 24-year-olds have at least attended higher education. That is more than in the 15 current Member States, where this figure is 74%. Moreover, the population in the ten new countries is younger than in the 15 current Member States. The phenomenon of an ageing population will therefore take a little longer to make its presence felt.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, those countries have great potential in terms of human resources. Utilising this potential to the full should be high on the agenda. At present, human resources are still deployed insufficiently. Unemployment in the acceding countries is high and opportunities for employment low. Of the population of working age, 14.3% are unemployed, as against 8% in the European Union. Unemployment among young people under the age of 25 has taken on tragic proportions: at 32%, it is twice that of the European Union. An extreme case is Poland, where youth unemployment is 41%. Moreover, in seven of the ten candidate Member States, youth unemployment in 2003 rose compared to the year before. It is therefore obvious that those countries, in accordance with the European employment strategy, should develop active and sustainable employment policy. Lifelong learning should keep workers deployable within the changing labour market. The number of people between 25 and 65 who attended courses in 2002 is 5% compared to 8% in the European Union and there is also the risk of a brain drain of highly-qualified staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is health and safety at work. Some countries prefer to provide higher wages at the expense of health and safety provisions on the shop floor. Purchasing power and pre-tax income are far below the EU average, but they have increased – even considerably – while they fell in our countries. This amounts to a simply outstanding achievement. A big problem, however, is that wages remain too low to enable people to escape poverty. Poverty in the ten countries concerned affects 40% of the working population. Social security should be developed more effectively. Social partners should be organised more effectively because at the moment, they still have insufficient organisational power to be able to really organise social negotiations in the countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Economic adjustments, combined with processes of industrial restructuring under which mainly workers have suffered, is making for ever-greater problems in the new Member States’ labour markets. Now, when they are on the threshold of accession, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the overall goals and ambitions of a Social Europe will remain and cannot be lowered. The successful implementation of the Lisbon strategy in an enlarged Europe is dependent on social standards and on social legislation, both of which are means to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Going beyond that, the Social Affairs Committee urges the new Member States, in their political agendas, to give more attention to human capital.

This is a fantastic achievement by these people. As members of the EU they will, just like the rest of us, gain full freedom of movement to promote increased solidarity and strength throughout the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In different ways during my work with enlargement, I have met many ambitious, hard-working people. I therefore regret that, in the existing Member States, we seem to be so afraid of the workforce coming here. I am ashamed that, in my own country, there is talk of social tourism. This freedom of movement would mean a necessary injection into our slightly stagnated labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is more important in these countries than in the existing Member States. The areas are larger; three times as many people are involved in agriculture as in the present EU; and agriculture represents a larger proportion of the gross national income, that is to say, agricultural policy is more important for these countries than it really is for us. We need a policy for all the countries. We need, of course, to ensure that the new Member States have organisations that provide support and control and that they can tighten up food standards and the monitoring of animal and plant health. Much has happened and, if we compare the current situation with the Commission’s report, we can be pleased about the information that we are receiving to the effect that much of what had not been achieved by 30 September 2003 has now been achieved. We hope that the rest can be done by 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other two countries that we are dealing with, Bulgaria and Romania, are concerned, it is important to report that Bulgaria has made substantial progress in recent years and that the country deserves great praise for this. Romania has been in a more difficult situation and has further to go in order to catch up but, even this morning, we have received reports that things are happening, and of course we must recognise this and approve of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania is the most typical agricultural country of the candidate countries, having many small farms. Forty per cent of the population still works in agriculture, and many farms rely on subsistence farming. A huge economic and social change is necessary in order for development to be made possible, but we must remember that we have a shared responsibility. The candidate countries have their responsibility, but the existing Member States must also take responsibility. The Commission must participate rather than just making demands. It must also stimulate and make resources available. More effective use must be made of the SAPARD resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Having tried to follow the developments in Central and Eastern Europe for almost 40 years, I feel sincere joy at being able to welcome these countries both on 1 May 2004 and during 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a few aspects that I, as draftsman of its opinion, would like to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of transport, Romania is making considerable progress. Nevertheless, privatisation and restructuring in this sector deserve special attention. In terms of safety, particularly at sea, it is known that the situation of the ships sailing under the Romanian flag is often dubious. This House is taking this problem seriously. Romania must resolve this issue prior to accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the general absence of administrative capacity for regional policy, the incentives from the European funds are at risk of missing their intended purpose, while this is very much needed in the socio-economic framework. We would ask Romania to make a major effort to upgrade the Civil Service in such a way as to guarantee good use of funds and control over them. My amendments aim to make a few changes to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">While it cannot be denied that Romania is making progress, there is still a long way to go on the road to accession. I should like to encourage that country to walk that road with determination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our committee expresses satisfaction at the progress made by Bulgaria in most of the individual sectors of transport and calls for enforcement of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>to the road, railway and aviation sectors. It calls for the removal of its flag from the Paris list to continue to be a priority for it. It expresses its regret at the fact that chapter 21 on regional policy and coordination of structural instruments remains to be concluded. It calls for Bulgaria to ensure that effective structures exist to prevent, detect and punish instances of fraud and corruption, especially for Phare and ISPA programmes. It calls further for the strengthening of coordination and cooperation between ministries, as well as with relevant agencies and other stakeholders. It considers that direct efforts are needed in effective cooperation and communication, mainly between central and regional level, where we consider that there are problems, as well as in the consolidation and completion of institutional structures at both central and regional level.</p>

In this capacity, though, I do think that we should not be any less strict with the accession countries than we are with ourselves in matters relating to the complete transposition of the European Union’s Community acquis in the field of gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than focusing on what is missing,<span class="italic"> </span>then, we should show appreciation for the progress and the reforms that a country such as Bulgaria has managed to make, under difficult conditions, since its liberation from Communist dictatorship. After all, many countries that have been Member States for years are still having problems with properly transposing the directives on equal rights and opportunities for women and men, something that is, let me add, apparent from the Commission’s latest report on the Lisbon strategy for the Spring Summit. At this stage, then, in my humble opinion, we should be wary of delivering too many homilies to countries such as Bulgaria. Instead, we should be doing everything possible to help it, and countries like it, and to encourage it and them to proceed further along the right path, on which they have encountered these difficulties, so that – as we hope – this wonderful European country can accede to our European Union in 2007. The same applies to child protection, where there is certainly still much to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When having talks in recent weeks with the rapporteur and other Members, I tried to improve this report, but I must say that this attempt did not succeed, and this is why I have tabled some amendments on which we will vote in the House tomorrow. It seems to me that this report is not very balanced, that it is inaccurate and inconsistent with what our Parliament has maintained to date. Given the shortage of time, I will just concentrate on two aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: the issue of children in institutions and the issue of adoption. The serious nature of this issue should lead us to make serious and balanced assessments of the efforts made, of the improvements achieved and of what remains to be done. Above all, claims that have not been proven should be excluded, if we do not want to offend a friendly country and if we do not want our Parliament’s credibility to be lost. Rigour is of course needed, but not prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I do not agree with those who – in the name of totally understandable demand to reorientate the Romanian Government’s policy on some sensitive issues linked to European integration – fundamentally reject the results achieved to date. I should not like to think that these hurried and ungenerous judgments were influenced by the cost of enlargement to include countries of the Carpathia and the Balkans. If this were the case and if there were political short-sightedness of this kind, then I would like to mention – as Mr Daul did this morning in the House – the 50 million who died during the world wars of the last century. I believe that the only way to avoid the future risks that the recent war in Yugoslavia too has shown to be potential and real is to make progress in terms of integration. Rigour is of course needed, but so too is understanding of the efforts made and the results achieved. It will be much easier for a state to become fully legitimate within the EU than outside it. I believe that 2007 must remain the target for Romania and Bulgaria. This is not a certainty but an objective, even if – as Commissioner Verheugen said – the keys to this success lie above all with Sofia and Bucharest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hopefully the new countries understand that the Union is not about national objectives, but making progress on the basis of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that there will be no attempt to use the Union as a forum for punishing the past injustices of the East or supporting the unilateralism of the West. The European Union will not resolve conflicts through war or by using force, but through negotiation. That we have learnt from our history. The European model differs from Eastern and Western practices in that democracy also embraces civil rights at work, in education and even in the information society. It is also connected with the rights of employees, and consequently, the tripartite model in labour relations should also become standard practice in the new Member States as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The main partners in the enlarged Europe will be the United States of America and Russia. There are political and commercial problems regarding both. Internally we are divided to an unusual degree. When enlargement has taken place, the Constitution will not yet be in effect, decisions will not have been taken on future financial frameworks, and the outgoing Commission will have taken the Council to court. Two thirds of the Members of Parliament will have left even before the Commissioners. Nationalism seems to be on the rise, and the largest Member States are pushing for privileges.</p>
<p class="contents">If the agreement on the Constitution is not adopted this year, that will become more and more difficult in the years to come. Hopefully, it will not have turned out to be just a self-seeking exercise. Enlargement will nevertheless show that peaceful and equal cooperation is what is most enduring in all circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, the Europe that, since the Second World War, has been divided by an Iron Curtain, both physical and ideological, is to be united. The objective is both a political and a formal unification, as well as a real levelling out of the major economic and political differences that have divided Europe. We must therefore be delighted about enlargement, even at those times when it proves to be problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember, however, to tell the people of Europe about our common European success. In spite of the success of enlargement and of the ever greater importance of the EU in people’s everyday lives, it is still a fact that we politicians are not good enough at delivering the message to the people. Once more, therefore: in our political work, higher priority must continue to be given to informing and communicating with the people. It may be that, in the forthcoming election, we shall already be given a lesson in the form of a disappointingly low turn-out.</p>

Unemployment in Central and Eastern Europe is at a lamentably high level, never before has the gulf between rich and poor been so wide, social tensions are increasing and corruption is rampant. The one-sided pressure exerted by the EU towards privatisation with the minimum possible delay has positively laid waste centres of industry in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia that were once vigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">Social instability endangers democracy, and so the Copenhagen criteria are no longer the right instrument to deal with it. Such tendencies should be firmly brought under control and nipped in the bud.</p>
<p class="contents">Although individual countries have been given warnings about their treatment of the Roma, it is clear that the EU must take a Community approach, or else the problem will prove unsolvable. It will not be achieved by states acting on their own. The issue with the Russian minorities in the Baltic states is a political one, one in which Moscow may well appear to be exerting influence, but which is in fact a conflict centring on education and citizens’ rights, and it demands a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in my view, more than a political scandal that someone like Mr Telička, who has competently guided the Czech Republic towards accession, should have public doubt cast upon his appointment as its Commissioner for having, as a young man, belonged to the Communist Party for two years or so. This is the work of the evil genius of stagnant anti-Communism, which is capable of poisoning the atmosphere not only in this House but also in the acceding states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most painful paragraphs in various reports pertain to the Roma, who are being discriminated against, disadvantaged and treated as second-class citizens everywhere, including in the current Member States. In Slovakia, this has already culminated in riots and even a fatality, mainly on account of the reforms implemented in Slovakia, which, among other things, mean that social security benefit has been capped and is no longer dependent on the number of family members. This directly affecting the Roma, with their huge families, who believe that the measure is directed against them. That is why I should like to call for more effective measures not only in Slovakia but also elsewhere in order to improve the plight of the Roma. Moreover, the measures should not only be put in place for the Roma, but above all, they must be implemented by them, for they do not participate enough in the improvement of their own fate and their own emancipation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will focus my speech on the agricultural aspects of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I am concerned about the possibility of social problems such as a rural exodus and increased unemployment, and stress the importance of semi-subsistence farming in the accession countries. Like him I note that considerable problems remain, such as the fact that the administrations of several countries are still not capable of correctly implementing Community law, including the payment of agricultural subsidies. This situation is particularly worrying given the level of corruption in some candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am particularly concerned about a series of problems in the area of food safety and public health. On 4 March, for example, barely two months before accession, Poland asked for a transition period of six to 12 additional months in order to bring some 300 agricultural and food companies in line with European rules, when they should have been ready on 1 May 2004, thereby acknowledging its lack of preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be added that, since 2001, the ten accession countries have received around EUR 500 million per year through the SAPARD funds, for the sole purpose of adapting their agriculture to their rural areas. They are far from achieving this. I regret the fact that this whole undertaking was conducted so hastily. It strikes me at the moment that enlargement is like a runaway train that no one knows how to, or wants to stop. I cannot see, therefore, how I can share in the rapporteur’s conclusions; rather, I am concerned about them. This is why I will vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report began in committee with an approach that was appropriate right to the end and with which I and the rest of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy were satisfied. We must send out a message that is resolute but, at the same time, full of hope to the people and the government of Romania. Romania must proceed with greater earnestness and with greater rigour on the road of reforms, but it must get on the accession train, the European Union train. We cannot send out a message of gloom that excludes Romania from this prospect. It is important that our family extends to Romania, a country that needs the European Union and that needs and, in certain sectors, also wants democracy despite the existing problems. Let us, therefore, adopt this new version of the Nicholson report with conviction, hoping that it encourages the structural reforms that are necessary for Romania’s entry into the European Union in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two issues. Firstly, I believe we should acknowledge that Romania is taking steps and making efforts to comply fully with these criteria. I regret that Commissioner Verheugen did not acknowledge this. As we all know, this does not mean that there are no more obstacles to overcome, but it is encouraging that those obstacles have been identified and that the Romanian authorities have taken measures to remove them. The fight against corruption, as the Commissioner mentioned, to guarantee the independence of the justice system – and fundamental legislative reforms, contained in the new Constitution, are underway in this regard – press freedom, the reform of public administration, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to say that some of the recommendations contained in the report by Mrs Nicholson, such as the publication of the report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, have been accepted favourably by the Romanian authorities and, therefore, I believe that paragraphs 17 and 18 have become obsolete. And, of course, of the remaining obstacles I must mention the protection of children in international adoptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly and finally, I would like to say that, while the adoption of concrete measures within the specific time limits is important, it is also important that all of these measures move unequivocally in the direction of full compliance with these criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been the approach taken by the ten States joining us on 1 May and the same approach must be taken in this case as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the date is premature if you believe that every problem has to be sorted out before accession to the European Union, but then probably none of us would be able to belong to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the date is the right one, though, if you believe that now, and from now on, is the right time to join with these countries in a common union in order to resolve these difficulties. Whatever justified criticism may have been levelled at them, the fact is that these countries have, over recent years, worked very hard at their own modernisation and at the evolution of their societies.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, I do believe that there are certain problems to which we have to pay particular attention: corruption has already been mentioned, as has crime. One problem that I would like to stress here is the social problem, and social issues. I do believe that what matters is not just price stability, zero deficits, and tax cuts, but that what matters most of all is that growth is achieved and new jobs created – more stable ones, too – and the need for social stability in these countries to be supported and encouraged. Recent weeks and months have shown us the problems that there are in this area – with the Roma and Sinti in Slovakia, for example. You can trace something of a logical progression linking these disturbances with cuts in taxes, cuts in expenditure, and cuts in social spending. I do not want to say that this single problem is the only example, and the same is true, of course, in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that the total number of Roma and Sinti in Europe adds up to some 6 or 8 million, I believe that fact very much justifies the widespread desire – which I share – for a Commissioner whose area of competence would include the integration of Europe’s minorities, especially of the Roma and Sinti. In any case, I would ask the Commission, both before and after 1 May, to give a great deal of attention to issues of social integration, especially that of the Roma and Sinti. I know that Commissioner Verheugen is very well aware of how important this issue is, and I believe that the whole Commission, in the coming weeks, months and indeed years, should address it together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the one minute available to me I will refer to the report presented by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne on Romania. I believe it is a very well executed and exhaustive report on the problems existing in that country. It highlights the need for that country to make progress in compliance with the law and to combat corruption, as well as the need to strengthen the rule of law and respect for minorities. I am referring in particular to the Hungarian minority of more than one million inhabitants in Romania and also, naturally, to the Roma minority.</p>

For none of those ten countries has a date been set, and so they are encouraged to consider themselves wholly responsible for the success of the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still two candidates, Romania and Bulgaria, that having further to row to the finishing line, and Romania is lagging behind the most. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wholeheartedly endorses the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, which we see as an important contribution to highlighting any problems Romania is left with, particularly in a bid to meet the political criteria of Copenhagen. This is Romania's own responsibility: the key to success lies in Bucharest, as the Commissioner has already stated.</p>
<p class="contents">This list of problems has prompted the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to send a unanimous warning to Bucharest. The tone was clear enough to wake up the Romanian Government. A reorientation of the process is what is now called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, there was a large-scale lobby campaign on the part of the Romanian Government, with the message that reorientation was unnecessary. Much more constructive was the more recent list by Romania's Prime Minister stating tasks yet to be done, as well as the recent Cabinet reforms, in order to give the negotiations with the EU more chance of success. In this way, a foundation has been laid for observing the obligations of Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very pleased that the Council and Commission share Parliament's concern. As the prospect of enlargement on 1 May instils fear of the unknown among the European citizens – as the Commissioner has already pointed out – we should apply the greatest possible care in dealing with the later accessions. The public must be really convinced that the candidate Member States offer them the same certainties as the 15 current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption, about which humanitarian organisations in our countries receive many complaints, the freedom of press, also the subject of many complaints, problems with the judiciary and child care: these are the major points that need to be discussed and resolved as a matter of priority. The many letters they have sent indicate that this approach has sparked a great deal of enthusiasm among the citizens in Romania. It is important to show them that we are concerned about their fate. In this light, the contribution by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This fact would make it illogical to call for the suspension of Romania’s accession negotiations; it would send completely the wrong message. The opposite is true: what is needed is not for the negotiations to be broken off, but for them to be stepped up. We have to make it clear that we will now work even harder with all our Romanian partners to conclude the outstanding chapters and to resolve the country’s problems. That is the message that we must send to Romania today and when we vote on the report tomorrow: we will help you, but you must do the work in your own country yourselves; it is you who must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that Romania has a lot of time to make up; for almost ten years in the 1990s, the reform process made no headway at all. It has to be acknowledged, though, that some chapters have been driven forward at a faster pace in recent years, and that is something that has to be supported. We think it wrong that the report should state, in item 1, that Romania’s ‘becoming a member in 2007 is impossible’. This has to be expressed in more positive terms: it is still possible that Romania will become a Member State in 2007, provided that the problems with which we are familiar can be dealt with, provided that there is an independent justice system, that corruption is combated, that the administration is efficient and that minorities are integrated.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be careful not to set the country up as too much of a scapegoat. I see that, in items, 17, 18 and 19, we call for teaching to be provided in minority languages; I would be a happy man if people in other countries, including Member States of the EU, were able to use their own languages in schools, libraries and theatres in the way in which Germans and Hungarians can in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference to child marriages in item 19 has to be qualified. The practice of children being forced into marriage is not universal in Romania, but it does occur in some Roma families.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be important for my group to see whether our amendments will be adopted tomorrow; if they are, we will be able to vote in favour of the report. If they are not, we will have problems with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The concern was such that we doubted whether the negotiations could be concluded by the end of the year and therefore whether Romania could join us by 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">This strong message has today been taken on board at the highest level by Romania and we warmly welcome the personal commitments from the Prime Minister, Adrian Nastase, especially as they were accompanied by very concrete initial measures, which will certainly speed up the reforms that are still needed in order for the country to conform to the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that, to date, the Commission has been able to close twenty-two of the thirty-one chapters that it had to examine and that considerable progress in the fundamental areas of reform of the judicial system and in combating corruption should follow very quickly after the major cabinet reshuffle under way. The repeal announced of the current provisions of the criminal code, which is capable of limiting the freedom of the press, and, most importantly, the swift adoption of legislative provisions aimed at better protection of children, will be further tangible proof to us of the will of the Romanian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we welcome these encouraging signs and hope that they will enable the Commission to guarantee, in good time, that the accession of Romania will take place on the planned date, in circumstances that will ensure the good functioning of a further enlarged Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By doing this, I will be happy to contribute, in a modest but heartfelt way, to the arrival of the ten new members of the European Union. The same applies to Mr Van Orden’s report on Bulgaria. It is true that the rapporteur’s comments may sometimes appear very favourable, or even too much so given the situation in Bulgaria. On the whole, however, the conclusion of this report seems to me to be the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">The impression given by Baroness Nicholson’s report on Romania is different; in fact the contrast is striking. There is a feeling of unease when you see the indulgence of the report on Bulgaria and the severity of the one on Romania, when the two countries have a great deal in common. Baroness Nicholson did a significant amount of work over several months to monitor the case of Romania, and I welcome her efforts. However, the close attention that she pays to particularly painful problems, such as adoptions, led her to make very harsh judgments, so harsh, in fact, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already significantly amended the original text, which I welcome. Other amendments that we have tabled will, I hope, be adopted in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the resolution before us contains blatant contradictions. Several of the provisions come from different points of view and I fear that as a whole, it lacks the coherence needed for the European Parliament’s message to Romania to be clear, precise and firm. I regret this, because Romania, which faces huge problems and massive underdevelopment, needs to be understood, criticised when it deserves to be, but also advised and encouraged as to the path that we wish to see it follow and which will lead it towards becoming one of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should recognise the progress Romania has made in strengthening the Court of Audit, in judicial reform and in the introduction of the new Constitution, and we should not rule out a successful close to the negotiations this year. Every effort must be made, in particular by the Romanians, to maintain this momentum. However, we should signal our intent to them, and we do so by seeking to amend the resolution to replace the wording calling accession in 2007 'impossible' in paragraph 1.</p>
<p class="contents">But problems remain. Despite efforts to reduce the number of children in institutions, Save the Children Romania says that no attention is paid to combating trafficking for sexual exploitation. The recent reported death of 17 psychiatric patients from malnutrition and hypothermia in a hospital in southern Romania shows the severe problems faced by disabled people. Our Amendment No 3 shows that discrimination against these and other groups is magnified amongst Roma communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the rapporteur's view that the challenge is not simply one of closing chapters in negotiations but still one of dealing with endemic problems of corruption and political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am delighted that people from my own region in the east of England are linked through a network called Praxis with the Arad County Council in Romania. We must not lose sight of our aspiration, which is not simply about completing a political process of European enlargement but about bringing the people of Romania together with all those we represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So I found Commissioner Verheugen’s comment on agricultural policy this morning very helpful. Perhaps we ought really to be considering whether, if the accession countries’ administrations cannot implement these things quite that fast, the problem might not lie with us rather than with the countries of which we demand these things. After they have joined us, I would like to see a lot of our dead weight subjected to scrutiny, as we in Germany had to do after reunification, in order to take a look at all the red tape that had accumulated over the years and to consider whether the new Member States might not perhaps be able to provide us with more flexible and quicker solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is by way of general comment. I am the shadow rapporteur for Hungary, which has, of course, always been the model country, the country that, as long ago as August 1989, helped to cut through the Iron Curtain, to break down the Wall. With the pan-European picnic in August 1989, when everything was hanging in the balance, Hungary sent Europe a vital signal, and they have always done very well in fulfilling the criteria, so that they could actually be an example to the others. I am therefore particularly amazed that the Hungarian prime minister has come up with this curious proposal that candidates should stand on a sort of Unity List, with seats shared out between the government and the opposition, and that this would be the way to enter the new Europe. That really is an old way of thinking. Not a few Heads of State or Government would like to have things split half and half between government and opposition; perhaps the German Chancellor would in his present situation. The only thing is that democracy is about competition; it is about grappling with problems in order to find the right solutions, and so I wish that Péter Medgyessy, the Hungarian prime minister, would drop this idea and get back to our way of conducting parliamentary debate and, in his internal affairs policies, to competition between parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There remain only 51 days before the historic date of 1 May 2004, on which the European Union will grow to become a Union of 25 Member States. This particular enlargement of the European Union will be accomplished on Workers’ Day, a date symbolising our need to face up to the challenge of giving the Union of 25 states economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no less significant that, the internal policy of the enlarged Europe being a work of peace, we are developing it into a real, outward-looking common European peace policy. I have made Cyprus my concern ever since I entered this House in 1984, a time when few thought its accession a realistic prospect. Then, a few years later, Parliament forcefully urged that a solution to the Cyprus problem should not be made a precondition for its accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I well remember such former Members of this House as Mrs Pauline Green, Mr Jan Willem Bertens, and Mr Yannos Kranindiotis; we believed that the accession process would be the catalyst that would bring about unification. There is now a substantial chance of the 30-year-long division of Cyprus being brought to an end even before 1 May. Not merely is it to be hoped, it is also to be expected, that the negotiating parties will indeed seize this opportunity, which may well be the last for a long time, and I hope and trust that Turkey will stand by its recent indications of willingness to work towards a solution. We must bring about a united Cyprus, in which all Cypriots can live together in peace, and which can play a full part as a Member State of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Never before in the course of history has a new order been achieved without war or the use of force. This development is thrown into particularly stark relief when we consider the road taken by those states that have been able to overcome what was called ‘actually-existing socialism’ and to find their way to freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania deserve particular credit for having been able, along the road to freedom, to regain their independence as states. Speaking personally, I am grateful to the people, parliament and government of Latvia, who, with the European Union’s support, have created the conditions for solving an extremely complex problem, that being the progressive integration of a large Russian-speaking minority. When one bears in mind that the country’s ethnic makeup is the result, more than anything else, of decades of occupation, it was not self-evident that this would happen, nor was it so in view of constant misunderstandings and suppositions on the part of, among others, the Russian Duma. At this point, I want to extend thanks to Mr Brok, who, this morning, gave voice to clear expectation of a change in the Russian position.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Estonia, Latvia has set itself a task with, in future, a European dimension. I am convinced that the Russian-speaking minority will be successfully integrated into Latvian society, but that will depend on these citizens giving unmistakeable demonstrations of their loyalty to the Latvian state. It is also dependent upon their unconditional acceptance of the values and principles of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Future stronger and more extensive cooperation with Russia will depend, above all, on Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania putting down deep roots in the European Union. This cooperation is a strategic challenge for the European Union as a whole and the new Member States will have an indispensable contribution to make to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the two of them are sitting here beside me, so once again, I will express my thanks and appreciation for what they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur for Lithuania, I was particularly pleased by the high degree of approval – over 91% – in the referendum on accession to the EU, but also by the country’s high level of economic growth in recent years, which alone has made it possible to raise the funding that is needed if the social problems of transformation are to be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">Lithuania, though, is also a very pertinent example of the continuing tensions between democratic institutions and the Mafia elements that are attempting to exert influence at the very highest levels of the state. Where this is concerned, I have confidence in the independence of Lithuania’s constitutional court; I am also optimistic that the Lithuanian parliament’s investigations with a view to removing the present President from office will produce results commensurate with the requirements of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perhaps this very point, among others, that I find lacking in Romania, and many speakers, including those who spoke this morning have already addressed this. Perhaps not only the small-time players should be punished, but also the Mister Bigs. In Romania, too, corruption and nepotism go right up to the very top; that is one reason why the country has fallen so far behind, while another is that too few changes of personnel were made after the political change. The revolution was not a complete success. The simple fact is that many of the old structures are still in place – not only at the highest level, but also at others.</p>
<p class="contents">If the criticism is justified, then it is equally right that we should express our support and our willingness to help, but the main thing is that the work has to be done in the country itself, and sometimes the clearing-out has to start right at the top. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU, a body of 25 states, will soon have a population of 455 million and be the biggest economic zone in the world, even bigger than the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia, on which I am shadow rapporteur for my Group, has undergone huge changes over the last ten years, with the current government determined to deregulate. For instance, it has just cut business tax, along with income tax, to a competitive flat rate of 19%; this is most worrying to its neighbour Austria, which fears that businesses will relocate over the border. There have been similarly huge, visible changes in terms of prosperity, security, democracy, the rule of law and the fight against corruption in public life. In particular, we observed huge improvements in human rights, including minority rights, such as for the Roma communities and the gay community. Other matters as diverse as safety in nuclear power stations and food hygiene laws have also been implemented to the high EU standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Security is also improving for all our continent, as all acceding countries bar Malta and Cyprus, which I particularly welcome as British Commonwealth states, will shortly be joining Nato. We can safely say that previous enlargements of the EU have historically been a success story. Conservatives, on balance, welcome the process and expect a similar outcome this time. However, we in the United Kingdom are right to bring in measures to prevent benefit tourism, whilst at the same time welcoming those seeking to work in our country.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the horizon, we look forward to Romanian and Bulgarian accession in 2007. I am confident that the strong warning in the report on Romania will provide the incentive for its government to drive through the necessary reforms to satisfy all the Copenhagen criteria in time for Romania to join in due course, as scheduled. Today's sacking of the Romanian Justice Minister is a clear demonstration of the necessary political will for that process to occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself have witnessed at first hand on my visits to the accession states the quite extraordinary progress that has been made and Members have rightly drawn attention to that progress. There is still work to be done, but a huge amount of work has already been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has addressed this issue in a most effective manner. I wish to express my gratitude to Members for the role they have played in the very important task of communicating to the citizens of their countries the unique and extraordinarily important moment we have reached in terms of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree also with what Commissioner Verheugen said this morning on the need to send out a positive message – and it is a remarkably positive message. I cannot understand how democrats cannot see just how remarkable the moment will be on 1 May when Europe will be reunited and when the most extraordinary event will come about without the firing of a single shot, as one or two Members have said.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has full confidence in the Commission's ability to manage a smooth transition to membership of the accession states. I have already paid a personal tribute in this regard to Commissioner Verheugen. The Commission has the sole competence among the institutions to carry out the task of ensuring the proper functioning across all policies. I think that is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency at the same time urges the newly-acceding states to complete their preparations and in particular to complete preparation in areas where problems have been identified by the Commission. This is worth doing for the new accession states themselves and for the Union. I would encourage full attention in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Bulgaria and Romania, we had two fine reports before us today from Mr Van Orden and Baroness Nicholson. The presidency intends, in partnership with these countries and with the Commission, to ensure the application of the fundamental principle of this enlargement process and in particular the principle that each negotiation will be based on the merits of the individual case. The European Union will continue to monitor very closely the commitments made and the effective implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in order to guide both countries in their preparation for membership. The presidency urges both countries to continue carrying out these preparations energetically.</p>
<p class="contents">We are determined to do as much as possible to carry out the mandate of the European Council of December and to finish the negotiations this year. Welcoming both countries into the Union in January 2007 remains the European Union's objective.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members specifically mentioned issues relating to Cyprus and Turkey. Mr Poos, in particular, touched on this. At last month's General Affairs and External Relations Council ministers again expressed the clear preference of the Council for the accession of a united Cyprus. We welcome the agreement of the parties to resume the negotiation process for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem within the framework of the Secretary-General's mission of good offices. The Council fully supports Secretary-General Annan's efforts for the conclusion of an agreement, and we remain ready to accommodate the terms of a settlement, in line with the principles on which the Union is founded. I hope that the parties will redouble their efforts to reach agreement in the talks that are under way, and this clearly is in the interests of all the people of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">As we prepare for the European Union decision in relation to Turkey in December, we must also welcome the progress that Turkey has made to date in legislation for reform. Minister Cowen highlighted the crucial importance of moving ahead with the practical implementation of reforms at all levels of the administration and throughout the country when he led the EU Troika meeting with Foreign Minister Gül in Ankara on Monday last. Minister Cowen reiterated the assurance to Minister Gül that, if the European Council decides in December that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU is committed to opening negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of other issues were dealt with, but I want to return to one issue – the question of free movement and migration. A number of Members made the point that there is no evidence whatsoever to support some of the more scaremongering stories that have been spread in this regard. I welcome those particular contributions. Certainly at this point there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the floodgates will open as and from 1 May next. At best, this is tabloid hysteria. The study by the European Commission and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions shows that, even under conditions of full freedom of movement, migration from all the new Member States to all current Member States is likely to be about 1% of the working-age population of the new Member States over the next five years. That is hardly a flood!</p>
<p class="contents">The study shows that typical potential migrants are young and extremely well educated – the very type of people we need in the Union. It also shows that they are single, with no dependants, and that there is a high propensity for them to return to their native homes. The study confirms the view of the European Commission that fears of a huge wave of migration from the new Member States after 1 May are unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">I mention this point in particular because I know from the domestic debates on referenda in Ireland how easy it is for people of ill intent to misrepresent what in fact is the position. The reality is that Europe should be a Europe that welcomes the ten accession states and that we should fully meet all our obligations to the ten states.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank the Members. It has been a very thought-provoking and thorough debate. I know Members have put a huge amount of time and effort into what were necessarily truncated contributions. But points made have been well noted by the presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we also agree that people in the new Member States have shown a willingness to change, a willingness to go along with far-reaching reforms that some of us might like to see in our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption: ‘Germany!’)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am a member of the European Commission, and I have not spoken in relation to any particular country; there is a need for reform in a whole array of European countries, irrespective of who governs them.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the Presidency, which, in close cooperation with the Commission, is driving this process forward, and, where there are things still to be done, is doing them together with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make just a few more comments on the discussions this morning. I would like to say to Mr Titley, on the subject of anti-Semitism in Lithuania, that we picked up on the Lithuanian newspaper’s anti-Semitic outbursts at once. It was in fact the Commission that raised this issue in the first place, and the Lithuanian Government has since responded by taking appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">To those Members of this House who have spoken on the subject of the Roma, I would like to say that this is indeed one of the great unresolved issues in Europe, but that we cannot expect the accessions to produce a solution to it. It will take us at least a generation, if not several, before we can do away with social discrimination against the Roma, but what we did insist on as a precondition for accession was a detailed strategy that would help to overcome such discrimination in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to Mr Sacrédeus’ interesting comment on Turkey and Cyprus by pointing out that it was the Commission that made the explicit political connection between the Cyprus issue and Turkey’s political aspirations towards Europe and declared that it was hard to imagine us being able to initiate accession negotiations with a country that did not recognise an EU Member State or had stationed troops in it in such numbers as to contravene United Nations resolutions. It follows that Mr Sacrédeus’ appeal ought not to have been necessary, and that was the line we took; that was what led to the Cyprus talks happening now.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by returning to the subject of Romania. It was the Romanian Government itself that attached the greatest importance to the Council recommending a date on which the accession negotiations were to be concluded this year, something on which the Commission took a different view. Our line was that we needed more flexibility here, that this would be in Romania’s interests, and that it would be sufficient for us to conclude negotiations by the end of 2005 in order for accession to take place in 2007. The Romanian Government, however – for political reasons that I can well understand – insisted on 2004 as the date, and so we are entitled to expect it to make special efforts to fulfil all the conditions by then. I am happy to confirm what has been said by a number of speakers, that the warning shot fired by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy produced very rapid and credible responses; I have gained the impression that Romania has pulled itself together and that the process is now on the right track. I cannot do other than encourage the Romanians to continue acting in such a decisive way, and then, I think, we may yet reach our destination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not correct. The reality is in fact the opposite. The draft Constitution is entirely unsuitable for an enlarged Europe for two reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it maps out a State structure that is much too heavy and too rigid for a diversity of countries with very differing concerns. In an enlarged Europe, we in fact need a streamlined and flexible cooperation structure, which allows for a variety of forms much more easily than the current draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the draft Constitution provides for European institutions mainly functioning by majority, which is difficult to conceive in an enlarged Europe with no national safeguard clause. As the accession of Turkey appears to be under serious consideration by our governments – a possibility that I personally object to – have they thought about the far-reaching consequences of the reforms that they are proposing, which risk giving Turkey a central decision-making role in a Europe with uniform rules? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is interesting to note that the UK Unionist Parties are so enthusiastic about EU enlargement and keen to welcome on board these new Member States, many of whom are small, like Scotland, and in many cases have recently regained their independence.</p>
<p class="contents">A contradictory approach is taken by these Unionist Parties at home, where Scotland is deemed, by them, to be too small, too poor and too weak to be able to exercise the normal rights and powers of independence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Ireland, for example, has prospered as an independent EU Member State and it is fitting that in its role as EU presidency, Ireland will preside over this, the largest ever single enlargement of the EU. I have no doubt that Scotland too would be better off independent rather than being misrepresented and betrayed on a regular basis by UK ministers in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
