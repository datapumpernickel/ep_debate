<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 28 by Ioannis Souladakis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0781_EN.html">H-0781/99</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes. Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?</p>

According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority. The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site. According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana. Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material. It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country. This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%. At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India. In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology. So much for the political aspect. Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty. In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used. However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy. In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this. Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have explained the position of the Commission. You have to accept the fact that there is no <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on nuclear safety. So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Turkey it is different. The plant is not yet there. I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.

<p class="contents">The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action. As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe. None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme – Balkan Task Force. This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it. The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.</p>
<p class="contents">The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict. No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission. However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium. From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.</p>
<p class="contents">Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed. It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used. This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far. This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?</p>

We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo. But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium. That is also mentioned in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted. A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility. But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.

I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities. The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet. We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. I urge the Chinese again to do so. We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities. We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them. But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts. It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile. I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.

If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.

As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment. Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues. I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.

I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.

It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU. Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.</p>
<p class="contents">Are these reports accurate? What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration? Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?</p>

<p class="contents">In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure. At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks. The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code. The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman. The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public. It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself. However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ('mainstreaming') into the full range of EU aid policy. The guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in 'gender mainstreaming' but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate-General for Development.</p>
<p class="contents">'Mainstreaming' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy, strategy and measures. To achieve that, the Council's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety. Current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days' training in such issues should form an essential part of the Directorate-General for Development's introductory courses for new staff.

It is not to be brought in as a “sort of optional add-on”. This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women’s and men’s priorities and needs are better reflected. In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender. Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies. It would appear that we are in agreement about this. </p>
<p class="contents">However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers. If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming<span class="italic"> </span>will no longer be a priority. Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised. Only <span class="italic">one</span> manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day. That is naturally unacceptable. What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training? Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course. This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times. </p>
<p class="contents">As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.

<p class="contents">Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory – after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission – it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training. That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority. It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground. So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.

The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme. In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.</p>
<p class="contents">This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions. Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors. Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind. These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan. Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999. Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation. Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them. I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side. But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia. I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well. He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible. So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.</p>
<p class="contents">We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact. Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation. Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land. There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Greek action plan for employment</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies. The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with. The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures. Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: “Yes to Work” and “Back to Work”. We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres – this programme has already started but has not yet been completed – and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission’s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations. I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.

If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before. What has been done about training? Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?

<p class="contents">Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity. The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines. As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated. They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed. The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation.

The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control. Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.</p>

For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines. At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands. However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic. Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, – EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States – and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment. That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece. The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination. So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated. This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted. At the Commission’s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made. These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification. Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this. In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs. That is the sort of exemption we are talking about. Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures – which you have referred to – reach these severely less-favoured regions. They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists. Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them. I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to. I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.</p>
<p class="contents">With these forecasts of the structural policy – which I know very well – and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.

What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector. Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers. In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation. The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission’s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply. We are waiting to see what the next move will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation. The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending. Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage. What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries. And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
