I was tempted to start my contribution with a quotation from Gray's Elegy written in a Country Churchyard: ‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, /And waste its sweetness on the desert air." I hope the interpreters can cope with that. It is a bit presumptuous to compare myself to a flower, but, as so often, those who have worked very hard on this particular piece of the jigsaw in the liberalisation of the telecommunications market are here to join in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted to report the successful conclusion of this piece of work. The Commission and other colleagues will recollect that seven or eight years ago we tried to do this using a system of test‐house certification for type approval of telecommunications terminal equipment. For a variety of reasons, which we need not dwell on here, that really did not work terribly well, and Parliament and the committee took the view that the Commission was right to look at moving towards a system of manufacturers' self‐certification.</p>
<p class="contents">We have resolved a number of important issues, particularly at the conciliation stage. One was the question of the ability of terminal equipment to harm the network. I would draw the attention of Members to the joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission that came out of the conciliation process, because this is very sensible and states that the Commission will carry out a continuous assessment and will evaluate whether that risk occurs frequently. I went to a considerable amount of trouble to try to find out how frequent a risk this was going to be. I am very happy that the Commission will undertake this piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">At the conciliation stage we also adopted some strengthening amendments on the whole question of consumer rights that were flagged up to us from some Member States, but Portugal in particular. The directive is now the stronger because of that work.</p>
<p class="contents">During the work in committee and Parliament we also consulted with the Commission about essential requirements and the rights of disabled users, which, again, strengthened the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also clauses on the efficient use of radio spectrum and the emergency services. All in all, I hope we can congratulate ourselves on having done a very worthwhile piece of work. I commend both Parliament's view and the conciliation conclusion to you all.</p>

I did not realise that she was such a fine diplomat when it comes to politics and the telecommunications and radio sector. She has succeeded in combining the many very diverse elements of this issue, and, on behalf of my group, I wish to say I am happy that we have achieved consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain factors which Parliament feels are important have now been taken into consideration, such as, for example, adapting equipment for use by the disabled, something that has to be included in all technical matters. Standards have been raised, and the question of the radio ham has also been given attention. The question of the responsibility of the manufacturer and that of the distributor has also been raised. That is important because when this procedure is applied more widely it will be as if the burden of responsibility were much further removed, and thus Parliament is absolutely right to have highlighted the issue. We have found a procedure to apply in the case of equipment that does not comply with standards and in emergency situations, and naturally, as usual, Parliament has stressed the need for transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">We see that many of the requests made by Parliament have been given due attention, making for a healthy compromise. Customers and consumers can therefore feel safe using equipment, while sanctions and operations remain in skilled hands. I therefore think the agreement that has been reached is a good one and an example of how progress can be made in such matters, to end in a spirit of consensus. Practice will reveal what the future holds, and if there are defects in the system we will have to go back and deal with them.</p>

I say out of sympathy also because since 1992 this subject has played such a major role here. Parliament and the Council are of course working on the final phase of adoption, but in the preliminary stages, the Commission and all the services were very heavily involved. I mention this in particular because – especially as far as radiocommunication services are concerned, and this is the direction in which the debate is now heading – it simply was not possible to start work on this soon enough for this dossier to be brought to a conclusion in time to have an effect. It is this area of development which we believe is particularly significant. If you think that in the future a large proportion of terminal equipment will operate by radio, that is by cordless transmission, then you will see how important this whole subject is, and how important the whole debate has been.</p>
<p class="contents">If you listen to the experts, who say that in terms of technical development, one year today is equivalent to seven years in the past, then you have some idea of how urgently this decision was needed. I can only congratulate all of us – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – on going through the conciliation procedure and thus concluding our work on this far‐sighted proposal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, if Mrs Read is feeling a little lonely here in plenary she could comfort herself with the words of England's own bard, Shakespeare: ‘We few, we happy few, we band of brothers" (and, I would add, <span class="italic">sisters</span> ). The presence of many people is not always a sign of the importance or seriousness of the subject. Both the Commission and I personally have always greatly appreciated your work. By bringing forward European legislation and in that way defending the interests of citizens I would say that you are one of the most effective Members of Parliament. I only hope my remarks will not harm your chances of re‐election.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately the citizens themselves do not always appreciate the good that is being done for them, especially here. Both Parliament and the Commission have to show that they are effectively fighting red tape and over‐regulation. There is a prejudiced view that we produce ever more regulations but, in fact, the piece of legislation that we have been producing here – and, thanks to your efforts, have been able to complete and convince the Council of – is replacing more than 1, 000 national regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that we are listening to each other. People who have prejudices will not listen to us. They will repeat what they are always repeating, namely that the European Parliament and especially the Commission are eager only to produce new regulations for regulation's sake. Considering the advantages for small and medium‐sized enterprises that this is creating, I would like to see some of their associations praise Mrs Read. It is something which is making their lives easier. I would say to our trading partners, the US and Japan especially, who are always attacking Europe and saying we are a Fortress Europe, that we are now the most open market‐place for these products in the world. We can only hope – and we will do our utmost to ensure – that our trading partners will follow our example.</p>
<p class="contents">So many thanks to Mrs Read and to everybody who has participated in the work. The Commission is quite satisfied, and we endorse the declaration by Parliament and the Council that some adverse effects could possibly result from the introduction of these devices.</p>
