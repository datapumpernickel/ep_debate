<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the Commission expresses its concern regarding the social and economic consequences that the closure of ArcelorMittal and Nokia will bring. Some 600 direct job losses, as well as indirect job losses at suppliers, are concerned. In the case of Nokia, at least 3 000 jobs may be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">A company’s decision to close down production plants is for the company itself to make. However, the European Union can play a role, and the company needs to follow specific rules. As a very minimum, the Commission expects ArcelorMittal and Nokia to observe strictly the EU directives on information and consultation, collective redundancies and European Works Councils. The Commission also expects ArcelorMittal to comply with the agreements it concluded and the commitments it entered into with employees and local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can also provide specific support. The European Social Fund offers retraining of workers, including various forms of assistance such as counselling, help towards self-employment, and so on. If it is not possible to keep the jobs, and the workers are made redundant, Belgium or Romania, in this case, could apply for support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) if the Fund’s criteria are met. First contacts between the Belgian and Romanian authorities and the EGF services of the Commission have already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, I would like to highlight the main challenges that we face. First, it is becoming increasingly clear that growth is at risk in the EU. Indeed, recent projections showed that growth in many countries across the globe – especially in developed countries – is strongly decelerating. The EU economy is no exception to this trend. The sovereign debt crisis is making things even worse for several euro area countries by pushing up interest rates and further affecting confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, employment is a major concern. In the second quarter of 2011, employment growth measured over four quarters was a meagre 0.3%, and in August, the EU unemployment rate was still stuck at 9.5%, the same level as at the start of the year. In contrast to our assessment in the spring, when the prospect was one of job-loss recovery, we now have to fear an employment crisis in the EU with a number of negative features: high youth unemployment, which is twice as high as the average unemployment rates; high structural unemployment with high budgetary and human costs; long-term unemployment, which has already risen from its earlier level of under three per cent of the active population pre-crisis to just over four per cent in the middle of this year; and rising levels of precariousness. The recent recovery in employment stems mainly from an increase in temporary jobs, as the number of workers on a permanent contract has risen only moderately over the past four quarters.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is increasing social unrest as a result of the deterioration in employment, the implementation of severe austerity measures and wage cuts in the context of persisting inequality. Indeed, there is an increasing perception among Europeans that the cost of the crisis is not equally shared, with the poor suffering the most – and, as we have seen, this is a potentially explosive situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, it is important that EU policy makers provide a clear, coherent and comprehensive response in order to calm financial markets and bring back confidence. This plan should address structural flaws in the Economic and Monetary Union and concerns about Greece and other countries, but should also revive the growth potential of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of our public finances is very weak and we face lower growth expectations in the near future. This means that labour market recovery cannot rely on public stimulus measures and it cannot rely on GDP growth pulling the huge numbers of jobseekers back into the labour market. What we need to do is improve the functioning of Europe’s labour markets. Existing labour supply and labour demand will need to come together sooner; job matching should be more efficient; and existing jobs will need to last longer and be more productive.</p>
<p class="contents">With precisely this in mind, the Commission issued country-specific recommendations just before the summer break. These recommendations provide specific guidance on labour market functioning, tailored to each Member State’s situation and covering a wide range of labour market reforms including payroll taxes, child care, education systems, wage-setting mechanisms and retirement patterns.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all this, of course, what matters is not just what we say in Brussels: at the end of the day, what matters is what the Member States do, what governments do and what firms do. In order to be successful in improving labour markets, we need to build, and to make use of, the right partnerships in Member States, with the social partners and the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a road map for stability and growth to resolve the current crisis. Furthermore, our next Annual Growth Survey will present further proposals focusing on how to promote a growth-enhancing agenda that helps to create and maintain jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of extremely adverse market and financial situations, companies and their workforces throughout Europe have, by and large, engaged creatively in restructuring processes that were constructive, effective and instrumental in limiting job losses. The Commission wants to encourage permanent business adaptation to swiftly changing economic circumstances while maintaining a high degree of employment and social protection. Measures supporting the reallocation of resources across firms and sectors are strongly needed. They include employment protection legislation and business practices related to corporate restructuring which do not hinder the reallocation of resources, across sectors, towards higher-value-added and faster-growth activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the EU has put a substantial amount of energy and effort into promoting adaptation to change and restructuring. As announced in the Communication on ‘Industrial Policy’, in the Single Market Act and in the ‘New Skills and Jobs’ Flagship Initiative, the Commission wishes to put adaptation to change and restructuring on the agenda of public authorities, the social partners and other concerned stakeholders by means of a new consultation exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Its objective will be to disseminate and apply the good practice across Europe in the field of anticipation, preparation and socially responsible management of restructuring. The Commission will be using the knowledge and experience acquired over the past few years, including through the Restructuring Forums, studies and seminars. However, we must recognise that this <span class="italic">acquis</span> is still largely unknown to economic and social players. Furthermore, the Commission considers that it needs to be reviewed in the light of the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The EGF currently works with two possible intervention criteria: an application can be made either on trade-related grounds or on the basis of the global financial and economic crisis. This second criterion is time limited and runs out for applications presented after the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">As the unemployment situation in the EU is still far from recovering, the Commission has proposed – with the clear support of Parliament but without, so far, having achieved a qualified majority in the Council – an extension of this so-called ‘crisis’ derogation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is doing all it can to ensure that the crisis remains an intervention criterion for the EGF after the end of the current year and until the end of 2013, when the new EGF Regulation, proposed as part of the Cohesion Package on 6 October 2011, should enter into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being from Liège, I share the astonishment and dismay of the 581 workers made redundant and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am also thinking of the radical restructuring announced by the steel-making group in France, Germany and Luxembourg. The reasons given are always the same: a poor outlook for the steel market in Europe; strong competition with imports from China, Korea, Russia and Brazil; the downturn in the automotive market; and, lastly, the competitiveness gap, for example, between the Liège plant and the best plants in northern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, and despite 2010 being a difficult year, the financial centre of the steel-making group ArcelorMittal Belgium made EUR 1.394 billion in profits. It paid zero euros in taxes, in other words, a tax rate of 0%. This is particularly shocking. The group’s management would appear to be driven primarily by financial considerations, with a stop-and-go policy practised over a number of sites. Furthermore, these managers believe that site closures are nothing more than an economic adjustment variable, where human issues are of little importance. We must not put up with this any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned rules. Is it not time that the Commission drew up a binding code of social responsibility for multinational companies? Six years have passed since our Parliament adopted a report on relocations, on a corporate code of conduct, on the repayment of subsidies, on obligatory consultation between companies, trade unions and public authorities. Since then, it is clear that little real progress has been made regarding these various proposals. What, then, does the Commission intend to do about this, and when?</p>
<p class="contents">While we do need to keep our companies competitive and make Europe an attractive destination for financial investment, we also need to adopt a robust European legislative framework to deal with relocations and restructuring and to ensure that full account is taken of another type of capital: human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the case of the Liège plant, I hope that it will be eligible for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund assistance, to compensate those workers who have been made redundant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday it was Renault and Vilvoorde; tomorrow it will be Gijón, Asturias, France, Luxembourg. Commissioner, how much longer are we going to sit doing nothing when the facts point clearly to the de-industrialisation of Europe, when companies seek to maximise profit oblivious to the needs of the people and the regions affected, amidst a crisis of confidence among workers, and a rage that is spreading throughout Europe when we see that those companies can do anything they like without even the most minimal restrictions on their activities?</p>
<p class="contents">For years – and not just now, Commissioner – we have been asking for this, as my colleague has said: it is six years since the Cottigny Report. Nothing has been done, Commissioner. Furthermore, in terms of the Globalisation Fund, to which you yourself have referred, we are seeing an attempt to divert it, to use it for other purposes, and even to put an end to the Globalisation Fund itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a new European strategy to confront these restructurings, Commissioner; we need to relaunch that consultation process that you put an end to, that you were engaging in and stopped as a result of pressure from industry and BusinessEurope. We need to put an end to these delays and to the feeling of resignation we see within the College of Commissioners. I am aware of your efforts, Commissioner, but you need to redouble them, because Europe cannot continue to sit and watch the destruction of its industrial fabric.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow the market to be all-powerful while we do nothing. We need to have a common European legal framework that is comprehensive, that put needs first before and after restructurings, that listens to trade unions and workers, and, above all, Commissioner, we need a law of rationality, not the law of the jungle, which is what we Members of the European Parliament are observing impotently, as, I very much fear, you are too.</p>

However, there is precious little left of either of these industries today. The most recent victim fell last month, or this month, at ArcelorMittal in Liège, where countless jobs have been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this is particularly tragic for the workers who have lost their jobs. I hope that we, from Europe, will be able to provide the necessary support to help them find a new job and that we will support them with the opening of our labour market, resulting in more jobs, and by coupling this with growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we in Europe should also learn our lessons. Several Member States have actually gone too far with a pathetic industrial policy designed to try and protect industries and jobs against globalisation, while in fact, a different policy, namely modernisation, was necessary. It is therefore imperative that the Commission keeps an eye on how European State aid and State aid by Member States is allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second, very important point and it has to do with reconversion. We from Europe definitely need to focus on innovation, on modernising our economy. In my own region, we have a good example of that, precisely in the steel industry. Since Flanders is steel-friendly, many efforts are being put into high-tech innovation in the steel industry in order to create absolute added value and to be internationally competitive once more.</p>
<p class="contents">When guiding Member States in the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy, Europe and the Commission have to be unreservedly committed to enabling that innovative and high-tech reconversion. It is absolutely essential that we as Europe stop fighting globalisation and that we stop giving our citizens any false promises. It is important, just as you have mentioned, that we as the European Union adapt, that we link up reconversion with growth in order to make a modern economy possible. We must once again anticipate what globalisation will bring to us. We should no longer allow ourselves to be passive victims of it, but rather try to give it more direction from Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world’s largest steel producer, ArcelorMittal, is therefore closing one of its three blast furnaces in Poland. It has already closed furnaces in Belgium, Germany and Spain. Here, we immediately start talking about the need for European intervention, and about subsidies from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. We think up ways, European-style, of how to fix the market, which is logically pushing down steel prices with the falling demand.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, it is clear that ArcelorMittal is capable of restructuring production itself and of looking after its employees very well. In 2004, ArcelorMittal made 1 700 employees redundant in the Czech Republic. In 2006, more than 1 000 were made redundant, and in the following years again, more than 1 000. Arcelor at that time applied a policy of voluntary redundancies. The people who went voluntarily received severance pay equal to their average monthly pay for between one year and two-and-a-half years. As a result of these steps, the company turned around its former losses of almost CZK 1 billion, and last year made a CZK 700 million profit.</p>
<p class="contents">I now therefore consider it a huge error and an injustice for EU money – our money – to fund the restructuring of blast furnaces in Belgium or other West European countries. The Czech experience shows unambiguously that there is no need for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You read out some general considerations to us regarding employment, adapting to change, and growth. Today, however, ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel-making group, is making massive profits. Moreover, thanks to certain tax breaks euphemistically called ‘notional interest’ – which should, incidentally, be prohibited at European level – it has ended up making unbelievable profits at a time when it is announcing the closure of the hot phase in Liège.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, today, the question ultimately is not whether the Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be implemented, which I obviously want. What I am asking of you, Commissioner, and of the entire Commission, including, moreover, the Council Presidency, the Polish Presidency, is something else entirely: it is actually, as has been said, to prevent the deindustrialisation of Europe. Steel is not dead; steel has a future, in Liège and elsewhere. Its production processes are becoming more diverse. We need steel and high-tech products. That is true. These are not outdated industries. These products are, on the contrary, extremely high-tech products.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to European inertia, 50% of steel production has gone elsewhere: to China, India, South Korea, to the East, to Japan. This exodus has placed entire industries under threat. Not just ArcelorMittal in Liège, today, but an entire industry inexorably linked to its clients: car manufacture; construction; the green industrial revolution, namely wind turbines; trains; trams; all buildings requiring simple, environmentally sustainable steel production, steel production that is fully integrated into the industrial fabric. We will need all of these. To get there, Commissioner, we will need more energy than you have described.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the banks are being recapitalised. That is all well and good, but what is stopping us from recapitalising the European steel industry too? The domino effect we are seeing today – between the hot phase and the cold phase, between maritime and continental steel industries, between the steel industry and all of its subcontractors – is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This needs to be stopped, Commissioner, and to stop it, I suggest that you do four things: firstly, launch a public takeover of the plant. You did so for Dexia. Why not do so for the steel industry? I am asking you to do so. The opportunity is there to replace this private sector failure and actually establish a Europe-wide steel industry. To ensure that this happens, I also call on the Presidency to convene a European Council of Ministers for the Economy to lay the groundwork for a proper European steel industry plan. Let us take the initiative, then. Thirdly, I believe that we need investment, and to that end, I suggest you use the project bonds that Mr Maystadt presented to us in the Committee on Budgets and which are an extremely interesting and valuable tool. Lastly, I believe that a consolidated tax base is needed to prevent relocations and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">So, yes, I believe that for all workers, for engineers, for the regional and national elected representatives of Europe, there is a future for the steel industry. European industry has a future and a chance to build that future. This chance starts in Liège, and I am waiting for you there.</p>

This is resulting in the direct or indirect redundancies of thousands of employees. At the same time, ArcelorMittal, which, year after year, has been fed billions of euro in State aid and tax exemptions, is continuing on its breakneck quest for profit. For example, the Walloon Region has provided hundreds of millions of euro in aid to Mittal for CO<span class="sub">2</span> quotas and over EUR 110 million in investment, when, at the same time, the group made a net profit of EUR 238 billion, for the sole benefit of its shareholders. State aid has merely served to fund Mittal’s devastating strategy: buying out a competitor at a low price to rob it of its know-how, then destroy it, so as to ultimately import at a lower cost. Mittal is definitely a predator, but national and European policy choices have allowed and funded its predatory actions. Yes, this is the result of your policies, and your institutions are bowing and scraping to Mittal to the bitter end, because even now that it is talking of job losses, you are still proposing to grant it State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do now, then? There are two possible answers to that question: the one offered by the majority of this Parliament, which entails whinging and relying on the sacred markets, at whose altar they pray, in giving even more State aid via the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and in keeping citizens sweet until the next elections; or the one offered by progressive Europeans, who propose nationalising ArcelorMittal, given the billions in State aid that that group has already received. The aim: to create a public group in the form of a European economic interest group (EIG) for the steel industry, with the support of our universities’ high-tech laboratories.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to the immoral drivel that we hear, the steel industry is not an industry of the past; it makes high-value-added products; it is vital for a European metal industry. We still have the know-how, the means of production and a qualified workforce. Therefore, we must not allow Mittal or anyone else to destroy them! We must protect them and develop the European steel industry. Let us give Europe, at long last, the industrial policy that it will need in the future.</p>

European legislation has placed unforetold pressures on businesses and industries and makes it more viable for multinationals to shed European jobs or relocate to Asia. Meanwhile, with the help of EU funding, a number of large companies have relocated from Western Europe to Eastern Europe, in the opposite direction to labour migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of people was designed to alleviate labour shortages, not create overcrowding in the job market. Yet due to legislation coming with freedom of choice, migrants flock to certain countries to find there are not the employment opportunities they envisaged. Because they are entitled to welfare support, they stay, increasing unemployment and competing with domestic applicants for posts.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the Commission should instruct companies to open up opportunities to other EU applicants only when there is not enough domestic competence to meet an industry’s needs. Twinned with reducing the burden of legislation, allowing Member States to compete in the employment market, labour could be targeted where needed, easing the congestion of unemployment in the worst-affected areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is which countries are next. We may condemn one company, Arcelor, but it is obvious that it is also Nokia’s problem. The question is which companies will be next. I am very often told in conversations with various companies and large investors that, ‘We will have to pull our business out of Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed this subject in the European Parliament five months ago: what can be done in order to prevent the relocation of our companies? Currently, it is becoming a reality. We are talking about this only in the context of the crisis and the drop in steel sales, but maybe we should also think about rising costs. We maintain a climate-oriented policy which is a burden on companies and which will be an even bigger burden if we tighten other criteria. This is exactly the context in which many enterprises declare that it might cost us further relocations. So the question is whether this is the big wave, the beginning, or is it just the end and a few cases, and also how big the loss of jobs will be that is still ahead of us in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing is that we may lose our industry without achieving our climate goals, because outside Europe, these companies are free to develop their production, polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming, while here in Europe we are losing jobs. Moreover, in the future, when the crisis has passed, we will have to import steel and pay extra for transportation and pollute the environment by this transportation. Therefore, it seems to me that we need to take a very hard look at how we are going to achieve the objectives of industrial production while protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to enhance its efforts in order to achieve a global agreement on climate, because that will not promote relocations due to much lower costs than in Europe. At the same time, as has already been mentioned in the discussion, the same question is being asked again and again: what can we do to keep this industry in Europe. Therefore, we must balance the different objectives in order to curb rising unemployment rates in Europe, and this time we do not have to pay extra from the Globalisation Fund, because it is just another expense.</p>

ArcelorMittal’s brutal decision is just another example of this in a traditional industry.</p>
<p class="contents">That decision – and this has already been said by others – was taken despite substantial profits, tax breaks and also the efforts made by our workers to improve competitiveness. It is the cause of considerable distress for hundreds of families, and it threatens the entire production chain, including the cold phase, the downstream industry and subcontractors. This represents thousands of jobs in a region that is already severely affected by unemployment. This decision to close, which stinks of pure speculation, and which is probably the first of many in Europe, comes with the owner’s refusal to sell the plant to any potential buyer in order to avoid competition. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, how can we force this multinational to sell its production plant, thus ensuring competition by continuing activity and securing jobs? Trade union leaders advocate a transitional takeover by the public authorities. Do you think this is feasible from a European point of view, and how? Those two specific questions aside, Europe needs industry and industry needs Europe now more than ever, with the crisis. We must strive to ensure that the manufacturing industry and SMEs are once again at the centre of growth, even in traditional sectors, which are still innovative and can guarantee the industrial independence of Europe and the Union. This is one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe therefore needs to allocate adequate budgetary resources to kick-start a proactive industrial policy across the continent, a policy which does not play workers off against each other or promote social dumping, but which supports research, develops competitive clusters, maintains integrated processes and addresses the energy challenge. It is high time that Europe reacted and stopped acting powerless by putting up with others’ speculative strategies, which are impoverishing our citizens.</p>

The steel giant is closing its liquid steel phase and thus laying off hundreds of workers. Two thousand people are going to be affected directly or indirectly. Naturally, our thoughts are with them and, as elected representatives of Europe, with all of the workers involved at Arcelor’s other sites and at Nokia’s sites, too.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that in Liège, in addition to the essential support measures and measures to redeploy the workers, in addition to the equally essential clean-up of the site – this is very important, in fact – all options are on the table at the moment. It is important to point out that promises should not be made to the workers if they cannot be kept, and I echo Mr Daerden’s question regarding the compatibility of some of the options envisaged (such as temporary regionalisation) with our European Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner pointed out, the directives on redundancies should be observed, but Europe must also learn from these social tragedies. Parliament must call on the Commission to strive for progress and a change in mentality. Now that we realise that our regions in Europe can no longer depend on a single sector of activity, more than ever it is time for diversification, for specialisation. In the immediate future, therefore, the Union must work with the regional authorities to facilitate the economic regeneration of the Liège basin. For example, there is an obvious need – and I agree with the strong sentiments expressed by Isabelle Durant and even – miracles do happen – by my communist colleague just a moment ago, although he has now left – to preserve the steel units, which have a high added value. It is also vital to invest today – and I am finishing here, Madam President – in jobs for tomorrow, in sectors as varied as biotechnology, agri-foodstuffs and biologistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparing for the future and ensuring alternative employment are, without doubt, the best responses we can offer our citizens today, in Liège and in the other regions of Europe alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is not just economic troubles that are causing this painful rise in unemployment in all regions of Europe. Before we become too self-congratulatory, we should look at the policies of our own EU institutions, which are shouldering a large part of the blame.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I realise that this debate is primarily focused on Arcelor and on Nokia, but I also want to mention my very serious concerns about a large and important employer in my region of Northumberland. I am talking about Alcan, the aluminium smelter. Alcan is a smelter which, earlier this month, announced that it may have to close and it may have to close partly because it has effectively been strangled by EU legislation. The Emissions Trading Scheme and the Large Combustion Plants Directive have caused Alcan to face serious competitivity problems. Closure of the plant will mean the direct loss of around 750 jobs and many more indirectly in a part of Northumberland which is already afflicted by very high levels of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">I and many others warned about the knock-on effects of ill-thought-out legislation such as this, but our concerns were brushed aside by the Greens and over-zealous environmentalists whose fixation on reducing carbon emissions made them deaf to all of the arguments about economic and environmental damage. We warned of the risks to businesses, we warned of the risks to jobs, and we warned about the serious effect that it would have on the environment caused by carbon leakage.</p>
<p class="contents">Employers like Alcan and ArcelorMittal are at breaking point, and one by one they are going to relocate to other parts of the world where they are not choked by the same cumbersome environmental legislation that we have here in Europe. Of course we want to reduce carbon emissions, of course we want to avoid carbon leakage, but we do not do that by exporting jobs and by exporting companies to other parts of the world. We do nothing but export jobs and we export the emissions along with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As happens every day in the financial sphere, today we find ourselves again confronted with industrial groups that are exploiting States, that are exploiting regions.</p>
<p class="contents">After demanding tax relief, financial aid for employment and research, and free CO<span class="sub">2</span> emission allowances, yesterday they promised us investment only to today shut up shop without sparing a thought for the impact that this might have on the men and women whose skills and commitment were the group’s main asset. And all this for what? To satisfy the thirst for profit – which we refer to in French as ‘<span class="italic">cupidité</span>’, or greed – of the shareholder. In this case, I can speak in the singular because I am referring to Lakshmi Mittal, the owner of ArcelorMittal, who, not too long ago, was the fifth richest man in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These decisions highlight the urgency of a European response because, if we want to regain our economic sovereignty, we have to act at European level. Indeed, although companies like ArcelorMittal, Nokia and BNP Paribas – and I could mention many others – may be able to exploit Member States and their regions, it is much more difficult for them to do so when they are confronted with a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What does working together mean? It means an integrated tax policy, not just a common corporate tax base, but harmonised rates, ensuring that we can no longer compete against each other. The same applies to social and environmental standards. It also means establishing a common industrial policy rather than one that is fragmented among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Union is not going to turn into a steel empire overnight, but by spending its budget in the right way, it can orientate its industrial development. It is high time that we stopped subsidising certain activities – we recently voted in favour of coal mining subsidies – that are, in fact, diverting resources that could be invested in the technologies of the future, including steel manufacturing.</p>
<p class="contents">European action must also prepare for when things go wrong. We need binding rules, a binding legislative framework that imposes a pan-European process on these multinational companies, inviting them to base their choices on objective facts and to take decisions in conjunction with all of the social partners. It is in this framework, too, that we must demand a return on all of the tax, social and environmental subsidies that these companies have been able to enjoy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is not: it is part of a tree of rotten apples; it is part of a trend of profitable corporations using the crisis as a cover to throw thousands, or tens of thousands, of workers onto the scrapheap in order to maximise already healthy profits and push them up even further.</p>
<p class="contents">This represents a failure of right-wing governments and their policies, and their fawning over these corporations: the creation of taxation policies to suit these corporations and the giving of subsidies to these corporations. Look at the massive tax breaks from which ArcelorMittal has benefited in Belgium. ArcelorMittal Belgium declared EUR 59 million in profits and paid EUR 42 000 in taxes. ArcelorMittal Upstream announced profits of EUR 35 million and paid a whopping EUR 936 in taxes, and ArcelorMittal Finance managed to declare profits of EUR 1.4 billion and not pay a single cent in taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the thanks for this generosity on the part of the Belgian State, paid for by Belgian workers and by the impact on public services and so on? Almost 1 000 direct job losses, and many more jobs indirectly lost.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies in Ireland where, despite our generous corporation tax rate, and despite increasing its European profits by 21% over the past year, the insurance company Aviva is still committed to laying off 1 000 workers. The response of the Commission reminds me of the response of the Irish Government, which is mere lip service – crocodile tears for the workers who have lost their jobs, but a continuation of the policies that got us here.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the demands of the workers in ArcelorMittal to nationalise that company to save the jobs, and I think the trade union movement across Europe must, in the context of unemployment and the context of the crisis, wage a campaign to have any major corporation threatening job losses taken into democratic public ownership and run under democratic workers’ control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore understand the economic and social tragedy facing us and, above all, facing the employees, my fellow citizens of the commune where I was born and where I still live.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some people think that industry is taking advantage of the current delicate economic situation in order to relocate its plants to regions that are believed to be more favourable and more conducive to profit-making. However, I cannot help but express my regret, as others have already done here, at the lack of power and dynamism of our supposed European industrial policy. I also regret, in particular, the fact that we constantly impose new regulations on our industries, be it through energy prices, excessive environmental protection requirements or highly prejudicial tax arrangements. All of this undermines their competitiveness in relation to their third-country competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the constraints that I have mentioned and the absence of a genuine industrial policy result in an unfavourable climate and limited development prospects for the industries still based in the European Union. The European Commission, with its often absurd proposals, and certain enlightened Members of this Parliament are the ones who are jointly responsible for the decisions that have harmed Europe’s heavy industry, including the steel sector, which is closing loss-making plants.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore calling here for a renewed industrial policy that is worthy of the name, based on innovation, with a view to ensuring greater coordination of sectoral policies and more realistic climate change and environmental policies. It is true that the industries leaving Europe are no longer creating pollution here, but we will eventually import for sale on our market products from third countries that use production methods that create much more pollution than our methods.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is our role here in the European Parliament. The national social partners and the national governments will be the ones responsible for managing the social and economic situations on the ground. I, personally, trust them to do so in my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, after experiencing three years of Nokia in our country, the company’s slogan could become ‘Disconnecting People’, as was suggested by a newspaper in Finland. This was obviously a specific developing country-type investment, similar to the attempt that is also currently being made in the case of Roşia Montană to launch gold mining using cyanide technologies. The dishonest pursuit of profit only serves to exacerbate the precarious situation of the majority of people, national chauvinism and scepticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Nokia took full advantage of the facilities generously offered by the Romanian authorities, benefiting from the handouts without meeting their obligations. Now they have decided, in an unprecedented cynical manner, to shut down. While trade unionists from Bochum in Germany have received compensation amounting to 60 minimum salaries, Romanian employees are only being offered three salaries in compensation, and their chances of reintegration into the labour market are virtually non-existent in the current economic climate. This is why I am calling for the European Commission to get involved without delay so as to ensure that the staff made redundant are treated decently, with the aim of supporting their professional retraining.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the sharp fall in transactions on the steel market and in the price of steel is about to cause new restructuring in the steel industry. There is the risk that 10 years after privatisation, the almost 9 000 Romanian employees at the ArcelorMittal plant in Galaţi will be affected. A common strategy is needed for all the decision-making phases in order to maintain production capacity and ensure genuine protection for the workers’ interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the prospect of a rise in unemployment, I think that the European Commission’s priority must be, first and foremost, to preserve jobs rather than checks on electricity tariffs, which will help preserve the production units.</p>

Therefore, when faced with mass redundancies in a company, it cannot intervene effectively and deal with the social issues of mass unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The disappointment of the victims is understandable. We need to break the vicious circle that exists: firstly, there is the announcement that no profit is being made; secondly, production overcapacity continues; and finally, when there is no other alternative, those directly affected are drip fed the idea that their company will be closed temporarily or permanently. That is what is happening in both Liège and Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen this before. We have heard it done before. It is too hasty a reaction. What we need to do is provide prospects in good time and explore alternative options if jobs cannot be maintained in the same sector. What we need is firm dialogue among partners and a proactive approach that offers long-term prospects, as long as they are offered in good time, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if this social dialogue results in other industrial projects in other sectors, that is still better than nothing. It is still better than the worst possible solution: unemployment. Workers whose jobs are under threat need to be offered prospects rather than becoming resigned to the fact that, little by little, they will suffer a tragic fate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if this debate has one merit, it is that it is highlighting the need for a genuine industrial policy at European level. We should add that in order to achieve this, the European Union will require real resources, rather than the purely symbolic ones it currently has, particularly when it comes to the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the former intends to make approximately 3 500 workers redundant in Romania, Denmark, Finland and Great Britain before the end of the year 2012, and the latter plans to get rid of 1 000 workers in Belgium, as well as to cut back production at its Spanish plant.

<p class="contents">First, helped by Nokia, we have found out how we Europeans lost our competitive edge. For too long, producers chose to relocate in order to reduce production costs. That was fine from a cost-reduction perspective, but it was not a guarantee of increased quality in a very competitive market. Cheap is not enough. That is what companies like Nokia found in Romania. Nokia closed up shop in Romania because it was severely hit by its own lack of mobility in terms of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">So costs are important, but knowledge and innovation are vital. From this point of view, Nokia only has itself to blame. What about the 2 000 or so Romanians made instantly unemployed by Nokia? Should they blame the smart phones that defeated Nokia? That would not be very smart.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem for Romanian workers is that a unified European market allows Nokia to operate successfully or unsuccessfully in Romania, while Romanians face a restricted labour market. In other words, Romanians won the right to be made unemployed by Nokia, only to then be denied a job anywhere else in Europe. That is the second lesson that we can learn from the Nokia fiasco in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, assistance from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund could alleviate the problem, but only an unrestricted European labour market will solve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nokia received massive financial support for the construction of its plant in Bochum in Germany and then for its plant in Cluj in Romania. At the same time, the redundancies and the safeguards put in place for the employees were financed from public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is dishonest to cite the crisis and production costs that are allegedly too high or, as has been mentioned today, environmental legislation as a justification for mass redundancies. Every employee at the plant in Cluj generates turnover of EUR 1 million each year and costs less than EUR 10 000 per year. We can no longer stand by and watch companies unscrupulously pocketing European money and then simply moving on like a plague of locusts. All the small agencies working on European projects have to sign contracts concerning the sustainability of their projects. Why does the same rule not apply to large companies? It is high time for us to introduce clear, tough regulations in this area. A voluntary approach and calls for compliance are completely useless.</p>

There is a small town where I live, and within the region I represent, called Brough. It contains a large airfield where pilots trained in Spitfires for the Battle of Britain. People have now started to talk of the ‘Battle for Brough’, as BAE Systems threatens to shed 900 jobs, leaving a workforce of only 400.

For this reason, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that we must put in place an investment policy alongside the austerity policy in Europe. Steel is needed for renovating buildings and for increasing the proportion of renewable energy. If we want to make environmentally friendly cars, we need lightweight, high-quality steel.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also invest in modernising the steel works in Europe and must move away from run-of-the-mill products and towards high-quality steel. This is something that is particularly lacking in the ArcelorMittal group. Yesterday was the meeting of the European works council of Mittal. The trade unions have found out that ArcelorMittal writes off more money than it invests in all the countries where it has a presence and that it benefits significantly from tax breaks.

<p class="contents">I am well acquainted with Liège’s steel industry. I worked in research there for 20 years. The sector does have a future. Cutting-edge research is being carried out into all aspects of galvanising and vacuum coating. That side of the steel industry has a future. What Arcelor wants to do is carve up the company, in other words, carry on with cold rolled steel production, for the moment, but stop hot rolled steel production, while keeping its research centres. It will carve it up and then it will see if it survives. That is not how an industrial policy works. We cannot leave Europe’s economic policy in the hands of financiers. They have destroyed the Liège operation. Tomorrow, the cold rolled steel division will probably close, and who knows what will become of the research centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, either Mr Mittal will agree to sell and there will be a buyer, or the region will be redeveloped. However, Mr Mittal cannot say today, after the gifts he has received, after the CO<span class="sub">2</span> allowances, after all the aid, that he is going to carve up our steel sector and then see what happens.

Nokia demonstrates that the limits of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are clearly identifiable and highlights the free-rider effects for companies, which are much larger than we would like.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, Nokia built a plant in the 1990s in Bochum with EU funding and, in 2008, closed production there from one day to the next. It then moved to Romania because the cost of setting up a plant there was lower. It has been said that as much as EUR 22 million was provided from the European Structural Funds. In Bochum, 1 300 workers were made redundant overnight and EUR 10 million of public money was invested to ensure that they could find new jobs. EUR 5 million of this came from the European Union. Now the same thing is happening in Romania. Nokia is closing its plant again, 2 200 employees are being made redundant and another request has been submitted for European money.</p>
<p class="contents">Nokia must be put on a blacklist for subsidy shopping and must not be given any more support. At this point, we really need to consider how we can prevent free-rider effects of this kind and how we can put a stop to this. This should not happen at the expense of the workers. However, we need to change the way in which our subsidies are structured and Nokia must pay back the money from the structural funds which it has received in Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the Florange site is concerned, I call on the Commission to speed up its selection process for the NER 300 programme, because we must examine all the other options for maintaining activity on European soil. Indeed, this site brings together, under the Ultra-Low Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="sub">2</span>) Steelmaking (ULCOS) programme, all the elements needed to set up a pilot project in the field of CO<span class="sub">2</span> capture and storage, thereby striking a difficult balance between heavy industry and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, the more blast furnaces are shut down for the long term, the more it will cost to start them back up again, and the greater the risk of this project failing, which would be catastrophic not only for the Lorraine steelmaking area but also, on a wider scale, for all the regions in Europe that are interested in reproducing this kind of equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was born out of steel and steelmaking. We cannot let it disintegrate and perish because of a financial crisis and because of the demise of steelmaking, for the sake of our jobs, our regions and our workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, ladies and gentlemen, you voted for all the texts that have given rise to the current situation, you approved these policies, you approved widespread free trade, you approved the agreements reached at the World Trade Organisation, which is leaving European industry, bound hand and foot, to the mercy of a number of foreign speculators.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission does indeed have a responsibility to bear. Under the pretext of maintaining free competition, it systematically opposed the creation of large European industrial companies, and recently, for example, it opposed Alcan’s acquisition of Pechiney, for the sake of competition. It opposed the ATR merger with de Havilland, as it was terrified at the prospect of a European company dominating the global market.</p>

Large companies should certainly be supported, but only those whose decisions to downsize are really justified, and who need help for their laid-off workers. Please do remember, however, that the five million jobs that Europe has lost during the crisis were lost, to a large extent, in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector. When helping the large, let us not forget that schemes should also be introduced to help SMEs to create new jobs. They are the ones who can respond to the difficult situation in the labour market in a timely and effective fashion. The elimination of administrative, tax and investment barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises is absolutely essential in order to create new employment opportunities as soon as possible for the five million who have lost their jobs. SMEs are the ones that can accomplish this task most quickly and efficiently and with most long-lasting effects.

<p class="contents">Commissioner, this resolve needs to go hand in hand with an industrial strategy for Europe, a firm commitment to innovation, training for the new jobs and the management of existing knowledge, because otherwise we run the risk of losing a strategic sector, and making Europe a poorer place for its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, Commissioner, I ask you all to show firm commitment and leadership in the intelligent management of European funds, and to set out some bold strategies so that we can build the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the consequence of the capitalist policies of free competition, of deregulation of the labour market, of flexibility and of flexicurity. It is because of these policies that large companies are going out of business after receiving high levels of EU funding, condemning thousands of workers to unemployment, even when their profits are as high as those of ArcelorMittal. Such scandals are on the rise in various Member States, including in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the European Commission to table initiatives that prevent multinationals from behaving in this way, and defend European industry. It is time to intervene with public policy, including the nationalisation of sectors fundamental to production and employment. It is time to return to regulation and to recognition of the rights of those who work. It is time for politicians to take control of the economy and to put a stop to large companies and financial institutions guiding EU policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to underline that the Commission shares your concerns, and I can understand that it is not only about Nokia or Arcelor. There were some references to other cases, and I think that we have to realise that this will not be an unusual case at times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis is here; it is not a conspiracy or an alibi, as somebody has suggested. It is a reality, and we all have to face this reality together. By ‘all’, I mean the Commission, the national governments, Parliament: everybody, because otherwise we will not find a real solution.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need to change, and we need to change because in an open world, we have to face the problem of competitiveness. We really need to help our industry to cope with all these difficulties, so we will have another debate on new skills, innovation and research. There have been a lot of good references here. We have to help, but in the meantime, we also have to help all these people you have mentioned who have lost their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do about this? It is obvious that there are a lot of different opinions here, but I can concentrate on some points that Commissioner Andor has already raised and I would like to consider again.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the Commission do? First, we can ensure that the law is implemented and enforced and that these companies have done what they have done according to the law. Secondly, we can use the funding we have available in the best way we can. With regard to the funds and the Globalisation Fund, I would like to reassure all the Members of this Parliament that in the coming financial perspectives, this Globalisation Fund will be increased, because there is a need for more workers to benefit. That is why the Commission is negotiating with the governments of Belgium and Romania in order to find the proper way to use this Globalisation Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a first reaction about compensation. Another thing we can do to go forward is to use all the other appropriate funding in order to help. This leads to our next debate about a new initiative from the Commission concerning skills, innovation, social business and social economy. These are new ideas we are going to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring to certain points the Member States have raised, both Ms Delvaux and Mr Cercas recalled the idea that we need a new framework for restructuring our companies. Yes, we agree, and as you might be aware, the Commission is embarking on a consultation procedure focused on this idea; all proposals are welcome. Ms Durant also came up with some proposals, which were also supported by other Members. We and our services are here to receive proposals, and we will involve all the stakeholders in order to find the best way to go about restructuring our companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the Commission is already facilitating some cases – this is in answer to Mrs Wallis. For example, we have intervened in an Irish case, the TalkTalk case, and we are also willing to facilitate other cases if they are mentioned to us.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also a lot of criticism about Europe lacking a common industrialised policy. Yes, this is true: we do not have a common policy; we are trying to get the best result in order to harmonise the different policies of the Member States. This is something that brings us to a more general political approach to the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate what President Barroso has already proposed. We have here a proposal about getting out of the crisis – the stability growth and deployment proposal – and I can see that the majority of this House supports it. But we need to do more in order to persuade the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to work together towards this. There were many references to the lack of a common base, referring to a common corporate tax. Yes, this is true; but it is also true that the Commission has come up with a proposal. Parliament has not yet voted for it and the Council is lagging behind. So please, let us work together.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, Madam President, I would like to underline that it is not the time for everybody here to seek national or separatist solutions. We have to work together if we are to find a way out of this crisis, and that means that we have to enhance all the procedures of cooperation between the Commission, Parliament and the Council – all the procedures in order to have a harmonised approach to very difficult issues such as financial policy, taxation, restructuring of our industry, innovation and research. We are doing all we can, and I hope that this House will help the Commission and the Council in this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look in frustration at the emerging economies and become indignant when multinational companies like Nokia or Arcelor decide to move their businesses from Europe. However, Europe expects robust measures and not moaning. In fact, we Europeans have the power in our hands to change what seems at the moment to be our inevitable destiny. One of the right responses is to go back to our own resources. We must complete one of the most important projects, namely, the single European market. We have extraordinary potential available to us which we do not utilise because we do not have common legislation recognised by all Member States, and we do not have common regulations in as many of the areas as possible deriving from the common market. We have instead numerous barriers. This is the very moment when it is the European Commission’s duty to offer the same solution to the redundancies undertaken by Nokia in Jucu in Romania as it did in the case of those redundancies in Bochum in Germany. However, these solutions are only a gesture. Without a functioning single market, the EU will merely remain a bystander watching their competitors advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
