<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Bowis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, you, the Commissioner and I all live with a disability. If we are without our glasses, we cannot operate; I cannot read, I cannot drive or avoid bumping into things, but I live in a society where I am helped to overcome that disability and therefore to function, even as a Member of this Parliament. However, if I lived in a developing country I would be less fortunate. One in ten people in developing countries live with disabilities. One in four families in poverty in developing countries has some member living with a disability.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the challenge, but this debate is not just about long faces, sympathy and pity; it is about celebrating the abilities of people with disability and seeing how we can enable them to function and to contribute to their own lives, economies and communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy, or resolution, is all about ending rejection, ending the concept of a scrap-heap, ending stigma where disability is concerned. We want a policy of prevention, of care, of enablement and of human rights. We want an end to no-go areas for people with disabilities. We want, if I can use the phrase, to see disability <span class="italic">sans frontières</span>. We want to see a break with that link to poverty so inevitable for people with ill health and disability in developing countries: no wealth without health, but no income without medicine. No income means no medicine; no transport means no school; no health certificate means no work; no access means no opportunity to prove one’s worth. It is not just about mobility, it is about all the disabilities that we have to learn to cope with in our different ways, whether it is sight, hearing, learning difficulties, respiratory problems or seizures.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy must be twin-track, and I use that word advisedly: it is in the guidance that the Commission has produced. It is the twin-track of prevention and care services. It is the twin-track of policy for people with disabilities and policies developed by people with disabilities, decided by them, with their involvement in policy making. We remember with pleasure those Ugandan members taking the seats specially reserved for them in the Ugandan Parliament for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see support for organisations of disabled people. We want recognition that neglected diseases are some of the biggest causes of disability. Some need those new partnerships to develop drugs; many need access to the drugs that we in the West take for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">I live with diabetes. I have said that on many occasions. However, I can function with the pills, blood tests and specialist attention that I receive to overcome that and to live a reasonably normal life. But when I was in Mali and went to see the services there for people with diabetes, I saw one room in a clinic and one in a hospital with people with amputations of legs and arms, losing their sight, their liver destroyed and facing early death.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a policy that helps people to overcome. Those people could be contributing to the economy of Mali. Our ACP adopted resolutions in Brussels in 2001, in Cape Town in 2002 and in the Year of People with Disabilities, in 2003, in Europe, we got the guidance note. But that is one of the best-kept secrets in Europe and in the developing world. My plea to the Commissioner is to draw out the excellent words of that and put them into practice. In particular, we do not want to see any more public European money used to continue building barriers for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The years 1999 to 2009 are the African Decade of Disabled People, set up by the African Union. That target date coincides with the end of our term as Parliamentarians and Commissioners. By that date I hope we will look back and say that we made the effort to help disabled people achieve, to enable them, and to make them real, whole people in the economies and communities in which they live.</p>

(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the guidance note on disability serves as a benchmark for taking account of disability issues in development policy. Incidentally, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the specific and obviously very interesting light he has shed on this very serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The note provides a series of guidelines and practical suggestions; it is not therefore really a question of implementing it as such but rather of ensuring it is circulated widely among the personnel concerned. It has already been widely circulated in the RELEX family of directorates general and the delegations. In addition, a training session on disability was held in September 2005. The Commission has also distributed its note externally. It has been published in the form of a brochure in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese and placed on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of disability in development policy is also covered by point 97 of the European Consensus on Development, which you approved a few weeks ago. That point is concerned with preventing social exclusion and combatting all forms of discrimination, including that based on the condition of disabled persons. To that end, it stipulates that the Community will promote social dialogue and social protection. The national level is the most appropriate for implementing this dimension. Preventing exclusion and fighting discrimination will therefore be done on request and on the basis of dialogue with the partner countries. Any disability-related programmes will therefore be developed on that basis and at that level.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Commission is in favour of improving outcomes in health and education by means of projects and, increasingly, by budget support. Political dialogue is an integral part of that support and it is within the framework of that political dialogue that the Commission is able to answer the calls made in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore try to encourage the inclusion of disability or of disabled persons in our partner countries’ development strategies while respecting this principle of appropriateness. We will be trying to convince governments that it is important to tackle these questions effectively. Obviously, we will be throwing all our weight into the battle so far as this is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware of the tragic situation of disabled persons, a situation that is all the more tragic in the developing countries and especially among the poorest, because I witness these human tragedies very regularly; that is why I am very happy to be speaking to you about it now. I also have to confess that I also sometimes witness the lack or total absence of interest in the disabled, not to say their exclusion, in some utterly deprived societies. I am therefore entirely convinced that your desires, your attention and your concern are justified and I will not fail to use all the power at the Commission’s disposal to deal more specifically with this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When discussing handicapped people in developing countries, we are talking in terms of people with both physical and mental handicaps, not only the blind but also children traumatised by war, and that adds up to hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries often lack facilities for handicapped people, who often live isolated lives. UNESCO estimates that 98% of children with a handicap in these countries do not go to school. The figures speak for themselves; policy-makers need to be particularly aware of this group of people. It will, moreover, be all the more difficult to achieve the millennium objectives if such a large segment of the population is left out of consideration. After all, handicapped people do not benefit automatically from programmes to combat poverty, an area in which there is no mainstreaming for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems were, and are, plain to see; the question is what we are doing about them. As has already been said, it was in 2003 that the Commission produced a guidance note for all delegations and services that gave handicapped people a place in development policy. In view of what the Commission has already said about the priority given to political dialogue, I would like it to tell us whether there is anything more to be said about the results. Is it possible for more action to be taken for the specific benefit of handicapped people? Have practical solutions been found for specific problems, for example in the educational field? Education is, after all, fundamental to the combating of poverty and social exclusion, which affects most handicapped people. Have handicapped people themselves been involved in the design and implementation of programmes? This is what is done in the Netherlands, and the results are very good.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what is the Commission doing about exchanging knowledge and combining learning in this field? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that disability and poverty are very closely related, and disability is also closely linked to disease and lack of health care. We already knew this in Europe, where disability is much more widespread in the marginal sectors of society and where, furthermore, disabled people from those sectors suffer much more as a result of their condition than those from other more comfortable sectors. What we are seeing now is that, in a similar way, disability affects the developing world much more than our industrialised countries and that disabled people in the South suffer as a result of their condition much more than those in the developed North.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution that we will adopt identifies this situation and calls on the European Union to take responsibility for combating it. The Commission will receive a recommendation from Parliament, calling on it to take account of the phenomenon of disability in all of its actions, both in the European strategy for the development of Africa and in the European consensus on development. This resolution should also help increase awareness of this problem on the part of our governments and populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all of that, however, and though the Socialist Group is committed to making every possible effort in this field, I feel that it is important to highlight the actions of certain developing countries that are demonstrating an admirable degree of solidarity in combating those forms of disability most closely related to poverty, lack of health care and underdevelopment itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba is unquestionably one such country: It has not been content simply to have a policy aimed at preventing and alleviating disabilities within its own society but, for some years now, has also been providing very significant assistance to other countries in relation to this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of this is what is known as ‘Operation Miracle’, as a result of which, and with resources provided mainly by Venezuela, more than 208 000 blind Latin Americans and Caribbeans had their sight restored in 2005 following free operations in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The recently elected President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, signed a series of agreements in Havana. One of them is intended to allow more than half a million blind Bolivians to be treated firstly in Cuba and then in several ophthalmological clinics that will be set up in Bolivia by Cuban specialists and using Cuban technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar projects are underway in Venezuela and other Latin American countries, and talks are being held with South Africa in order to explore similar initiatives. These actions should be valued in the European Parliament, just as they are in the countries in question, much more than fine words and well-intentioned resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Disabled people, as we have heard, make up about 10% of any population, but 20% of the poorest are disabled. Eighty-two per cent of disabled people live below the poverty line in developing countries. They are even more excluded than disabled people within the EU. They are excluded from social, economic and political life and, in many cases, are denied access to food, water and shelter.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about disability and development, we are not talking about charity but about basic human rights. All people – disabled or otherwise – should be treated as equal. That is why I am pleased that we are stressing the rights-based approach. We must ensure that disabled people and disabled people’s organisations are involved in discussions about what is needed and in the delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have made progress on the UN Convention on Disabled People’s Rights. Hopefully we will see something by 2007. Many of you know that I was rapporteur for Parliament’s position on this. We must ensure, however, that monitoring and enforcement procedures are included within the Convention. That is why I called for a legally binding Convention. It is important that whatever we bring forward, real action is taken and that action is monitored and evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of that action is to prevent more people becoming disabled. One way to eradicate this is to ensure that landmines and cluster bombs are not used. We must take action against all countries that manufacture, sell or use them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are so well, healthy and rich. We must give something back and more. We must not take from poorer countries in destructive and disabling ways. We like to put provisos in our aid packages. The proviso we need to include in aid packages is that aid should include people with disabilities and funded projects should include schemes designed to meet their special needs and open up new and equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must include enablement in all our approaches to development in developing countries. And I would remind you that disability is, in itself, still an area for development within the EU.</p>
