<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at my hearing before the European Parliament some weeks ago, I spoke out in favour of developing the closest possible working relations between the Commission and the European Parliament on human rights and democratisation. I would like to renew this voluntary commitment wholeheartedly today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is an extremely important partner for the Commission in this area of work, and so I am keen to follow in the footsteps of my predecessor, Mr Patten, in pursuing a comprehensive and regular dialogue with you on shared issues and concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of today's decision is to safeguard the legal basis for the continued existence of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights beyond the end of the year. This necessitates what I hope will be Parliament's positive vote on the Commission's longstanding proposal to extend Regulation (EC) No 976/1999 for a further two years. There are just two weeks to go before the Regulation expires, creating the risk that no funding will be available for projects and programmes under the European Initiative in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">It will only be possible for the Council to adopt a positive decision before the Regulation expires if the European Parliament votes in favour of the draft resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs today. In my view, this is in everyone's enlightened interest; it is also in the political interests of the three institutions involved in the legislative process, and, above all, it is in the practical interests of those whom the projects supported by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights are intended to benefit, namely civil societies and citizens in numerous countries around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Initiative is a well-functioning instrument: this is borne out by the statistics on the use of its budget funds as well as by almost all the human rights organisations which pay tribute to the Initiative and its valuable work. It is widely regarded as a successful instrument which provides direct support for civil society in many third countries where human rights violations and, above all, a lack of democratic development are endemic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Initiative supports numerous innovative and relevant projects, such as the abolition of the death penalty, torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims, the advancement of the rights of women – an issue which is especially dear to me – as well as campaigning for the rights and interests of children, indigenous people and other marginalised groups, and strengthening international law. This focuses, for example, on the International Criminal Court. It also aims to foster freedom of expression and promote democratic development through election observation missions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is a vibrant expression of our shared values and, above all, the European Union's identity in the world. I agree with the House, Mr President, that the Initiative must be effective and well-managed. The Commission will therefore scrutinise with attention and interest all the proposals put forward by this House which aim to achieve greater efficiency, the simplification of procedures and the effective use of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, let me give you my assurances that a meaningful, open and, above all, regular dialogue will take place between Parliament and the Commission. I believe that this dialogue will offer us the opportunity for joint discussion of the political and objective priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. After all, Parliament's and the Commission's priorities are largely identical; they include, for example, the need to support the European Union's Neighbourhood Policy via the Initiative or to reinforce democratic development in a number of countries. It is therefore important, in my view – and this applies both to my own and the working level – for us to focus on the same priorities, examine the needs arising in our Neighbourhood Policy together, and set the best possible priorities on a joint basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As parliamentarians, you have acquired particular expertise which I would like to draw on. Your support for the democracy movement in Ukraine or the forthcoming EU Election Observer Mission to Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza are eloquent examples, and all I can say is that I believe we will work well together here.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by expressing my hope that Parliament and the Commission will agree on the modalities for this further dialogue as swiftly as possible in order to develop genuinely fruitful cooperation in this field in everyone's interest. I look forward to our positive cooperation, and I gladly put my services at your disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased to see in the Chamber Mrs Morgantini, the chairman of the Committee on Development, Mrs Flautre, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the shadow rapporteur and my co-rapporteur on the Committee on Development, Mr Fernández Martín.</p>
<p class="contents">There were two regulations, one of which has already been adopted by this House. The one we are dealing with now is that covering third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Twelve years ago I was rapporteur and, as Mr Patten has described me, 'father' of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, which proved to be instrumental in helping the transitional ex-Soviet bloc countries. It was considered by many as the European Union's flagship scheme for democracy promotion. It gave meaning to the preamble to the Maastricht Treaty concerning the EU's foreign policy priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In its initial phase it was administered by a small foundation based in Brussels, with both the European Parliament and the Commission playing an active role in the allocation and supervision of projects. At its height in 1997, the initiative was financing and administering around 1 200 projects. In 1999 I visited some of them in Belgrade, including key pro-democracy media, such as Radio B92. The same year the initiative was taken in-house by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been concerned for a long time that the initiative has become bureaucratic and safe and that the European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, should once again play a greater role.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the initiative currently has a budget of some EUR 137 million, it lacks visibility and effectiveness. I am all the more convinced of this following meetings on the ground and discussions with more than 30 organisations. Most recently, I spoke to the Association of Belarusian Journalists – currently here to receive the Sakharov Prize – as well as the Eurasia Director of a US pro-democracy agency. They were not even aware of the existence of the European democracy initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very valuable programme and one that needs to be made more effective. An important point to make is that unlike routine EU assistance, the European initiative does not require the host government's consent. In a country such as Belarus, not to speak of Tunisia or Iran, in which operating through government channels is difficult and often impossible, this cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">In a paper on the EU security strategy in 2003, Javier Solana outlined the importance and sensitivity of Europe's new neighbourhood. The resulting policy invites our neighbours to the east and south to share in the peace, stability and prosperity that we enjoy in the European Union. It aims to create a 'ring of friends' around the borders of the new enlarged European Union. Sadly, the only visibility of the EU's democracy activities in the new neighbourhood seems to be short observation missions by Members of the European Parliament, such as those undertaken recently in Ukraine. I believe that all significant elections in the new neighbourhood should be the subject of full EU observation missions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a feeling in Brussels that democracy cannot be exported and that change must come from within. However, the United States National Endowment for Democracy has shown since 1982 that the two can be combined. It operates as an independent expert agency, using NGOs on the ground, and is much respected for its programmes and methodology. As well as the United States activities, the Westminster Foundation, for example, or the German <span class="italic">Stiftungen</span> and other NGOs have higher visibility and much less bureaucracy than the European initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently put together a document detailing the European Parliament's pro-democracy activities, both within the EU and externally. As Members, we participate in a myriad of interparliamentary delegations, consultation committees and informal groups. Valuable work is being done, but the work is fragmented. The same can be said about the European initiative. To my mind, our involvement should be coordinated in a democracy centre, based in this House, mandated to act as a research unit, an oversight body on all the EU's pro-democracy activities. To take an example, the website of the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor boasts that the United States has overseen the transition of 87 countries to democratic states. Is this a statistic that the EU wishes to leave in the hands of the United States alone? Last weekend's G8 Conference in Rabat – and I am delighted that the Commissioner was present – co-financed by the European Union, further developed plans for the Forum for the Future, first introduced at the Sea Island Summit in June 2004, to promote democracy in the Middle East and North Africa. Despite the financial contribution of the European Union to such an important event, it is the Americans rather than the European Union who are leading this activity. We recognise that the United States programme essentially echoes the principles of the Barcelona process and now the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, the United Kingdom will take over the presidency of both the G8 and the European Union. I sincerely hope that there will be a greater focus on the 250 million Arabs who want democracy, as illustrated by the 2002 United Nations Development Report, as well as the manifestly failing countries to our east.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, while I do not propose that the European Parliament should reject the regulation or the associated budget lines for any longer than strictly necessary, I find the response from the Commission – the letter from the Commissioner relating to the new arrangements on this programme, which does not reference working level contacts – and the Council – which is still using a working party consisting of development ministers – to the concerns I and others expressed about the democracy initiative to be lacking in substance and completely unfitted to the needs of our time and the needs of millions of unfree people on our doorstep. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will always be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McMillan-Scott has gone over this Regulation, a regulation that clearly demonstrates all our virtues – our many virtues – and also many of our problems. It is a modest regulation in terms of its budget, but very ambitious in terms of its objectives; we all agree on the need to approve it but, nevertheless, we have spent a year and a half – perhaps much more – dealing with procedural and bureaucratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue, which is to approve it on time and properly so that the Commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a very complex process. At the end of the last term in office we approved a regulation similar to this, by means of co-decision, relating to third countries. And now we are approaching the entry into force of the necessary extension, which begins on 1 January and ends at the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is highly valued by Parliament. I would point out that the budget line that provides for its funding – as Mr McMillan-Scott has just said – under the heading ‘European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights’, was created on the initiative of this Parliament – many of us who were present at that time are still here – and the Commission points out in its explanatory statement the full validity and the proper application endorsed by the impact assessment, which stresses the positive results concerning the development of the capacity of the NGOs specialising in human rights and concerning civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has considered it appropriate to restrict himself to producing a report that expresses support for the Commission’s proposal, modified by the Council with the clarifications and explanations it has thought it appropriate to include, but I would point out that a Regulation, with the same content and an identical purpose, for which I myself was rapporteur, was approved at first reading by means of co-decision and that we in the Committee on Development were entirely flexible and raised certain reasonable and simple issues so that it could be approved at the end of the last term in office.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have reiterated now in the amendments that in the end have not been voted for are very simple things which at that time we found it difficult to make understood. Parliament wishes to be informed and to know the results and the progress of the application of this project and wants these programmes to provide funding, as the Commissioner has pointed out, for peace missions and missions of electoral observers. Furthermore, it would like the Commission to present, on an annual basis or at intervals it considers appropriate, an analysis of the progress and results of the application of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">I suspect that the agreement reached at the end of the last term in office by means of co-decision, with the Committee on Development responsible for the main report, has been modified unilaterally. I hope that this will now be corrected, on the basis of the application of the Regulation, which provides the Commission with the funds necessary for the application of an effective instrument, as this one is, for promoting democracy and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel empowered by our own, widely-held understanding of the concept of the human race and of every human being, and also by the knowledge that the democratic world is also a freer world, a world that can be fairer, a world capable of building justice in freedom and, consequently, a more peaceful and safer world. By firmly committing ourselves to the European initiative on democracy and human rights, we are promoting democracy, peace, the human race and security, all at the same time. We must never lose sight of this, as we fine-tune the instruments that we establish and as we administer the resources that we allocate directly to this action area.</p>
<p class="contents">After a number of years’ experience, I should like to make some observations. Firstly, Parliament should be more involved in programmes specifically developed and supported in this field. The amendments that have been proposed to the regulation will address this question sufficiently, provided, of course, the Commission accepts them in the right spirit and makes a broad and extensive interpretation of the new guidelines, thereby taking relations with Parliament to a more open and closer level. This is what we are calling for. It is also necessary, however, to express our opinion on other issues that concern us more.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, are we going to dilute these instruments into more and more areas, more lines and more themes, or are we first going to set out a clear strategy, and then concentrate on a guideline that drives us forward and on fundamental priorities? I believe that the latter is the right way. The concept of human rights is increasingly broad and also sometimes more vague. There is also the temptation to use those instruments for anything and everything. This to my mind would be the wrong way; it would reduce the effectiveness of what we do and lead to a waste of scant resources, or to the duplication of instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other instruments for policies on cooperation and development with third countries, but these instruments of the European initiative for democracy and human rights are highly political and should be focused primarily on promoting democracy and that fundamental nucleus of civic and political rights, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of expression and debate, the separation of powers and the rule of law, freedom of organisation and activity of political parties and civil society, the opportunity to hold free and fair elections and the vitality of open and plural societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be capable, however, of setting out priorities as regards the regions of the world or countries with particular strategic impact on the actions that we support, for various reasons: firstly, because the country concerned is our immediate neighbour and therefore our most immediate security is at stake; secondly, because these are situations that can have a positive snowball effect at local level, in terms of establishing democracy and stability; thirdly, because in those areas of the world with particularly knotty problems we can find the weak spot that can be unravelled into democratic transformation; fourthly, because there are special historical links and cultural ties that bring us together; and fifthly, because our help can make all the difference in the short term and can have an instantly positive impact.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we must also ask ourselves if we are going to take the path of increasing bureaucracy and officialdom in carrying out these policies, or will we be able to make those instruments more agile? This, more than anything, is what I ask of the Commission; that it be capable of taking risks and that it set out the most adventurous, most daring and most incisive lines of action. Bureaucracy and officialdom would lead to those instruments being totally unused for one simple and intuitive reason. We cannot rely on dictators to encourage and promote democracy in their countries. We must therefore be more agile and must know how to take our help to exactly where it is needed, exactly where it is lacking and exactly where it will make a difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me come straight to the point. This evening Parliament is being asked to approve the extension of the specific human rights and democracy programme for two years. Our group has no objection in principle. During the recent months of dialogue with the Commission, however, we have placed some political conditions on our assent: that is to say, we want a clear signal from the Commission that you represent to commit to a structured dialogue with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of our claiming management responsibilities that do not fall within this Parliament’s remit, but rather of claiming the power to carry out a political evaluation of this measure and, more generally, of all initiatives relating to the development of democracy and action on human rights. We ask to be able to carry out an <span class="italic">ex ante</span> evaluation of the priorities of the initiatives and an <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluation of their quality and the degree to which they have succeeded in advancing democracy in real terms. In other words, Commissioner, this Parliament is asking to be involved in defining the guidelines for our actions and in judging the effectiveness of the results we obtain.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, many questions have remained unanswered and a great deal of information either has not arrived or has been supplied in a highly summarised form. We do not know the extent of the funds actually spent through this programme, which projects have been concluded, where they were carried out or with what concrete results – because in some countries the funds have been frozen – or indeed what is being done to unfreeze the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to break the sacred rules of comitology, but it is a question of finding a <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> for a relationship that is not just based on a verbal expression of good will. Commissioner, we appreciate your offer of collaboration, and our willingness to extend the life of this programme should be interpreted as an act of trust. It is important to make it clear that Parliament must not be regarded, as it often is, as a notary who is called in to formally approve the accounts but who has to confine himself to that alone. That is not in the interests either of Parliament or of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we believe that this programme should be streamlined and speeded up as much as possible. Greater responsibilities should be given to local non-governmental organisations on the ground, and more emphasis should be placed on microprojects and on certain campaigns that in the past have made some headway in the difficult area of democracy in some countries. We have to work a little harder on democracy, as we have neglected it up to now while focusing our operations on the area of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, it is also necessary to develop a capacity for dialogue, for which, Commissioner, Parliament will place our trust in you and give you our vote. We hope, however, that from tomorrow this will become a daily dialogue – not just a formality but a dialogue of substance – to assess the decisions that have been made and to define the objectives that we set ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Flautre (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps we should start with the very timely question posed quite rightly by Mr Fava regarding the dialogue between our institutions. It is a recurring theme, which by the way makes this late sitting at this late season of the year worthwhile. On this subject, Commissioner, we have heard you say and we have read – and you also said in your hearing – that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can describe as they see fit, but which I in any case understood to be regular, relevant, open and prolonged, or, in short, structured.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, the offer of dialogue, is clearly one that Parliament will jump at, because, as you know, the Members of this House are eager to have the opportunity to engage in in-depth discussions about the direction and ongoing monitoring of this initiative and to receive information about programming. Ladies and gentlemen, the ball is in our court and I am sure that the Commission would be delighted to see a proposal emanate from our ranks, from our committees and groups, in short from our Parliament, so that this dialogue can get underway very quickly, because it is urgently needed, with a group of Members who are well-motivated and have some expertise on this issue, and there is no shortage of such people in this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us return to the initiative. I think that we need to reiterate the extent to which it brings added value to all of the actions that the European Union might undertake on democracy and human rights. It has perhaps not been said often enough that it is the only means at our disposal to support, against the will of governments that are often autocratic or dictatorial, civil society, activists and NGOs working in conditions that are often extremely complicated. It is the only instrument that enables us to act in this way, and it is extremely precious.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would add that the aid that is given to NGOs in this way is perceived on the ground as being neutral, that is to say that the European Union is not providing these grants in a bid to dominate or take over and is not perceived as doing so, contrary to the claims made when American agencies work on the ground, with such claims very often heard in Maghreb, in any case. It is a very precious asset, made possible by the quality of the European Union’s intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there is still room for improvement. One of the issues, and we all know of many examples, is that some NGOs cannot, for one reason or another, be supported under this initiative. The governments of third countries which do not wish to see democratic movements develop in their midst are not lacking in resources or imagination. We have cases of legal NGOs being granted support under the initiative and then being quite simply banned from receiving the grant by a political decree or by direct censure. All of the decisions have been taken, but these NGOs are prevented from benefiting from the funds granted to them. We have other examples of associations which quite simply do not legally exist. In such cases we have to resort to subterfuge, and we therefore need the ability to be flexible and find ingenious solutions on the ground to achieve our goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007. And there, as other Members have rightly done, I would draw attention to the fact that we will need to work within this Parliament to ensure that this precious asset, that we can always improve, is able to endure beyond 2006. That is what is at stake in the debates that we are going to have to hold at various different levels within this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully agree with the need to extend the implementing arrangements relating to human rights, development and democracy. I congratulate Mr McMillan-Scott and I especially share the opinion of Mr Fernández Martín – in line with the vote I cast in committee – particularly on the amendment specifically calling on the Commission to produce an annual report setting out the programming and to report back to Parliament on the implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, however, in the words of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, seized upon the Commission’s willingness to collaborate and also to hold a serious and in-depth dialogue not only on the general guidelines but also on project execution. I truly hope, amongst other things, that this dialogue will also take place directly with the Committee on Development, which I chair, since the issues of human rights, the empowerment of women and democracy are in fact closely linked to the question of development.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to my very likeable fellow Member Mr McMillan-Scott that I understand his frustration and I agree about this precious project, as Mrs Flautre put it. In fact, parents cannot always bear to see their children grow up.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite frankly, I would not want to emulate the United States, because their actions have very often led to the rise of dictatorships – I am thinking of the Pinochet regime, for example. I believe the great plan for democratic development in the Middle East has already been repudiated by many in the Middle East because it is seen as an act of power and not as genuine help.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like us to retain our own individual character and also to value the important work that we are doing. We do not actually want to export democracy, but we want democracy to grow and to have the ability to grow, and we can provide the tools for that purpose. Through visiting conflict zones and seeing the huge number of projects, I have realised that the ability to act without going through the authorities is fundamentally important.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions of torture, training and recovery, as well as the question of the empowerment of women have been extremely important. I think we really need to continue along this path, but obviously in the knowledge that there are many limitations and many shortcomings, including in the area of finance. I should not like us to confine ourselves to election observation missions, which very often cannot actually be taken very seriously if you consider that they only last one day. I should really like us to continue operating along lines whereby our aid and our actions can truly be a tool for helping democracy to grow and not for imposing our values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cannot be said of all her colleagues, but that is no fault of hers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s role is becoming ever more important within the EU institutions, and its authority is becoming ever greater amongst the public in the Member States. After 25 years as a directly-elected body, Parliament’s importance is now at its height. Yet we should not derive satisfaction from the strengthening of Parliament’s role as a result of battles of competence or procedure within the European Union. To a greater extent than previously, the European Parliament’s role must be to promote democracy in the world and to provide information on values and standards. These values and standards ensure that, although our societies and political systems are not ideal, there are fewer wars and more dialogue on our continent, less violence and more compromise, and less institutional aggression and more international and institutional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a matter of promoting European values. It is a matter of informing people about a style of politics based on a search for the common good and on widening participation in government at every level. This is the role of both the European Union and the European Parliament today. Is EUR 100 million too much to spend on promoting democracy in the world? It is undoubtedly not enough, yet even a sum five times greater would still be much cheaper than going to the expense of repairing the effects of a lack of democracy. It would cost a great deal more to provide assistance to the victims of civil and international wars that break out because politicians in many countries do not understand the meaning of democracy. They only know it as a notion found in foreign language phrase books. If more than EUR 100 million were to be granted, it would of course be necessary to monitor both our own institutions and the organisations receiving the funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr McMillan-Scott, the rapporteur, for his work. I hope the House will continue to work together on this issue, regardless of political divisions, and that it will work towards the goals referred to by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look forward to working with her and, indeed, we look forward to the Commission's plans in 2005 and 2006 on this budget line, the legal base for which we expect to confirm tomorrow. I support the fact that this is a budget line that reaches the grassroots and that civil society in the countries has a priority in receiving the monies. I also support the fact that the Commission is planning to make conflict prevention a permanent priority for this budget line. Surely democracy is the best instrument of conflict prevention in our world.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what the Commission has done in terms of improving the contacts and support from its own delegations in third countries for projects under these lines, and also their plans to extend funding for micro-projects, in particular for local NGOs in third countries who are most valued by us in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have a word of criticism, it is that every year the Commissioner's predecessor used to speak about human rights and then come in with a preliminary draft budget that cut this line – last year from EUR 127 million to EUR 105 million. Perhaps the Commissioner will choose not to do that in forthcoming years. Indeed, as Mrs Flautre has said, I hope that, whilst there are proper objectives for simplification of the budget, this particular line has symbolic importance and will be maintained in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I also draw to her attention the increasing demands from international organisations, like the ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Criminal Court. However, if these are to be funded from this budget line there must be a significant increase or NGOs will fail. I oppose the attempt to reduce the priority given to projects worldwide under this budget line and refocus on near Europe. That is a mistake: human rights are universal in our world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I express my respect for the rapporteur, Mr McMillan-Scott, and his sincere interest in this budget line; but I am pleased that he withdrew his amendments, which I believe represented micro-management of this budget line. The Commission's commitment to structured dialogue, as it put it, is one that we should welcome, and, with my colleagues on Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights, I very much look forward to engaging with the new Commissioner on that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, let me say to the Vice-President, Mr McMillan-Scott, that if he had not already invented this interesting procedure, we would have to invent it now. I am absolutely convinced that it is a good thing, for I have always been highly committed to human rights. In other words, you can count on the fact that you are dealing with someone who really believes in what they are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say again that there will be genuine dialogue, not only at my level but also at working level. I would like to reiterate this point unequivocally. I do not agree that all we have done is observe elections. I can cite a host of examples demonstrating that this is not the case. We need only think of Ukraine, where a variety of projects is under way. Let me cite a few examples to show you that we really cannot view the situation in such narrow terms. The Commission is already providing support here: for example, it has given EUR 300 000 to the European Centre for Common Ground, EUR 334 000 to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights: Improving the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine through Legal Aid Provided by NGOs, EUR 787 000 to the European Roma Rights Center: Defending the rights of Roma in Ukraine, EUR 685 000 to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, and so on. These are just a few of the projects. Let me turn to another region of the world which is very important to you and, indeed, to me, namely the Southern Mediterranean, the Arab region, although this does not only include the Arab countries, it also includes Israel, of course. One example is the project entitled Palestine: Democratization from the Grassroots, Media and Networking as a Tool for Community Development, which is important in that it focuses primarily on civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate: I am particularly pleased – and I think this is a fortunate coincidence – that I was able to present seven action plans recently to the Commission and again here in Parliament on Monday. The Commission and the Council have adopted the proposals and everyone spoke about them in very positive terms. Why? Because these action plans will enable us to bring our values, namely human rights and everything with which they are associated – namely the rule of law, human rights and democracy – to these countries, such as Ukraine, as soon as free and fair elections have taken place there. After that, the implementation begins. However, they also focus on a poor yet important country like the Republic of Moldova, where we also need to take action. Belarus is a separate case which I will come back to in a moment. Then, of course, there are the major countries in the Middle East which are ready for this process, notably Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine and Israel. The presentation of these seven action plans at this time offers a really good opportunity, in my view, to work together with and on these countries. Naturally, the action plans also offer opportunities for us to present our priorities alongside the countries' own priorities and promote democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to outline some of the campaigns which we are carrying out within our human rights programme. I admit that they do not amount to a massive sum, but it is still considerable, and I believe that there is a great deal that we can discuss in detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Campaign 1 is entitled 'Promotion, justice and dignity'. This targets criminal justice, supports universal abolition of the death penalty, and supports the work of international mechanisms which monitor and report on respect for human rights and related international treaty obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Campaign 2, which is especially dear to me, is entitled 'Fostering a culture of human rights': human rights education, training, monitoring and awareness-raising by targeting advancement of rights of marginalised or vulnerable groups – that means the rights of women and children – including female genital mutilation, trafficking of women, human rights defenders; torture prevention and rehabilitation of torture victims, programmes of higher education and training for professionals, support for human rights dialogues. So, on the whole, it is a very important campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Campaign 3 is entitled 'Promoting democratic process'. This is essential for all these societies, especially for the Middle East or the broader Middle East, which I will come to later. So there is a lot of development of participatory democracy, fostering informed pluralistic discourse with civil society, targeting freedom of association, freedom of expression, independent press, broadcasting, unimpeded access to the Internet, and election observation missions.</p>
<p class="contents">Campaign 4 is entitled 'Advancing equality, tolerance and peace', embraces the issues of racial discrimination, xenophobia, rights of minorities, indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the selection of regions and countries and matching them with each of the four campaigns. All that is foreseen for 2007, and in the next financial perspective there will be only six finance regulations, four of which are very important ones: enlargement, development, good neighbourhood policy and stability. In all of them, democracy and human rights are in the mainstream, which is a real achievement on the basis of which we can work. There is thematic programming here.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to Belarus, which we spoke about in the Council recently, I explained that I wanted to work specifically with the NGOs. We then received an invitation from Lithuania to hold a workshop there. So we will have three phases: firstly, two phases in the Commission, and then we will confer with Parliament. Then there is also an invitation from Lithuania, because Lithuania, Poland and many of these countries know where we have to start with NGOs. You are right: we can only work with civil society there, because we cannot work with governments at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On the broader Middle East, I was very interested in this new possibility for cooperation. It is true that we have been working for ten years with the countries of the Middle East, the southern basin of the Mediterranean. The United States is now doing something similar. It is a good initiative, because the more we can work in parallel and thus bring more democracy and easier access to democracy to the region, the better.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to some other more formal questions. According to the information I have, for reasons of juridical coherence, the Council has now reintroduced the amendments tabled by Parliament when Regulations (EC) Nos 975/1999 and 976/1999 were at the drafting stage. I hope this information is welcome to the Members who raised this.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to work better with NGOs it was essential to have deconcentration, as we call it. That means that we have given a lot of responsibility to the delegations, that are also in a much better position to conduct a survey on what NGOs are doing. This is also why we will follow developments much better. I hope that there will be better control because I know that while, on the one hand, we should have a speedy means of action, on the other hand we also have to be very careful and to control things properly. This is what I wanted to say. Indeed, it is an offer of dialogue on my part. I thank you for taking it. We are not perfect, but there is a positive offer and I hope that Parliament will take it in this positive spirit to work together for the major values of our European Union – that is, human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission is beginning to examine the possibility of doing some work in Belarus. I mentioned Belarus, and also Tunisia and Iran: two other countries where nothing is happening. I am grateful for the good will and the commitment of the Commissioner in her new post, and we welcome her into it. I also welcome her commitment to establish some working-level cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I advise the Commission that this week the European Parliament, through the good offices of the Human Rights Subcommittee, is commissioning a study by independent experts into the operation of this programme. It is something I asked for last year from the Commission, but it was unwilling to give it. This will be completed by February.</p>
<p class="contents">May I make one final remark, since I know the Commissioner was in Rabat at the weekend and we are dealing with a vast and important agenda: the process of reform in the Middle East. When I began working on this report, the funds available from the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights to the entire Middle East were four per cent of the total. Given the circumstances of the last three years, that was an extraordinarily low figure. I am pleased the Commission is now adjusting that, and we need to refocus the programme. Notwithstanding what Mr Howitt said, we have strategic objectives and strategic priorities. I am pleased to see the Commission is now beginning to focus on those.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Commissioner for her words and for her commitment, and we look forward to working together constructively and practically, but on the basis of equal interest in the development of democracy, particularly in our neighbourhood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
