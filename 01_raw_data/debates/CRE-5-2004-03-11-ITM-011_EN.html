<p class="contents">This Parliament’s position, during the long Venezuelan crisis, has clearly expressed the need to find a peaceful solution, a solution through dialogue, a constitutional solution and a solution achieved through essentially electoral means. This solution was enshrined in an agreement between representatives of the government and of the Democratic Coordinator by means of a recall referendum, which is the constitutional mechanism laid down in Venezuela’s Magna Carta, which allows the popular support for the President of the Republic to be revalidated.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent decision of the National Electoral Council not to validate a significant number of signatures collected in order to call the referendum does not, in our opinion, respect either the spirit or the letter of those agreements and has been the catalyst for the recent events in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is clear, Mr President, that citizens cannot be deprived of exercising their legitimate rights and that the National Electoral Council is obliged to facilitate and guarantee the exercise of the popular will.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, therefore, by means of this compromise Resolution, signed by three political groups, must call firstly for calm and moderation. It must call on the government to guarantee the rights of all citizens, including the right to peaceful demonstration. It calls on the National Electoral Council to accept and adopt without delay the recommendations of the mission of the Carter Centre and of the mission of the Organisation of American States. It reiterates its support for the agreements reached between the government and the Democratic Coordinator. It expresses its concern at the failure to comply with them and calls on the government to guarantee their implementation as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is also necessary to call for a redoubling of the European Union's efforts, with the aim of ensuring that these agreements between the government and the Democratic Coordinator are complied with. I believe that the most desirable thing, as a result of these agreements, would be for a recall referendum to take place soon, which is the European Union's desire, expressed by means of various statements by the Council of Ministers of the European Union on the initiative of the Commission, and for a mission of European Union electoral observers to be appointed to accompany this process of ratifying and holding the recall referendum, which is the institutionally established mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution is in line with the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council of last February, which urged compliance with the agreements between the government and the opposition. In this regard we are facing a degree of contradiction because the current Venezuelan Constitution has been drawn up by the party currently in government with a large majority. Nobody obliged the government to include the recall referendum in that Constitution, but it was included. Nobody obliged the government to reach an agreement with the opposition on 29 May 2003, but it was reached. Furthermore, that process is currently being carried out in cooperation with the Organisation of American States, the Carter Centre and also, to a certain extent, the European Union – because we are contributing to the process.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, in line with the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and in view of events, Parliament, which has expressed its opinion on Venezuela on other occasions, wishes to point out that constitutional rights can be infringed by violation of essential procedural requirements and we believe that in this case there is a violation of essential procedural requirements, since by alleging that there were certain ‘coincidences’ in handwriting, hundreds of thousands of signatures have been annulled. Other procedures could have been used. If it was believed that those signatures were not correct, a system of sampling could have been used, for example, in order to verify whether those hundreds of thousands of signatures were really correct. But what is not acceptable is for them to be annulled in this way without in any way bearing in mind more that the one million signatures needed for a recall referendum would have been collected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently facing a decision by the National Electoral Council, supported by the government, which is intended to deprive Venezuelan citizens of a constitutional right recognised in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the resolution is very clear. We are not trying to inflame passions. Quite the opposite. We are appealing for calm. But we want this process of restoring constitutional normality to conform to the spirit of the agreement of 29 May 2003. In other words, it is not a question of one side imposing its will on the other, but neither is it a question of preventing the exercise of a constitutional right such as the right to call for the recall of a President. And to do so in the way that the National Electoral Council has done, by annulling signatures en masse, makes the exercise of that right impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, it is clear that the Carter Centre for Democracy and the Organisation of American States are negotiating with the Venezuelan Government and with the opposition with a view to seeking a way out of the conflict and we hope that the Commission, as always, will cooperate with Parliament and the Council in the task of reassuring the Venezuelan population and making it possible to put the Venezuelan constitutional process back onto a democratic electoral course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that a stubborn president is refusing to accept the democratic will of the people, must the country go back to being what it was? I want to share with this House my own experiences of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Half a century ago, I was one of the children in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, who did not go to school but instead roamed through sewers and shanty towns built against mountain slopes, their houses made out of orange crates with roofs of corrugated iron. Large cars, luxurious houses and golf courses were enjoyed by a small elite, while, on the street, close to the doors of smart offices and shops, I saw sick, legless beggars. The hospital where my father died was filthy and chaotic. What limited public transport existed was in the hands of various companies, each with buses in their own colours, but without proper connections. In other parts of the country, in the second city, Maracaibo, for example, I saw Indians, impoverished and shunned by everyone. The road from the capital to the coast was lined with crosses for people who had fallen to their deaths, while, on other roads, dust storms were whipped up as you drove along. The president was a dictator who had his opponents hanged from lampposts by his police force, recruited from Italian immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">My experiences at that time gave me the hope and the expectation that the people would not always accept this scandalous combination of dictatorship and extreme wealth, extreme poverty and extreme neglect. Forty years later, they stopped resigning themselves to their lot and could at last have a hope of a stable existence, growth and solidarity. By a large majority, they democratically chose a parliament composed along different lines, a new constitution and a quite different sort of president.</p>
<p class="contents">That President Chávez put too much faith in the army and did little to help the victims of the great natural calamity does not justify the coup d’état in which he was abducted and replaced temporarily by the chairman of the employers’ federation. Nor do his shortcomings justify the forging of an immense number of signatures in order to get sufficient support for a referendum aimed at again deposing him.</p>
<p class="contents">While the United States recognises the present Venezuelan Government as legitimate, the two major groups in this European Parliament allow themselves to be led by their contacts with parties that were formerly in government, but have been voted out by the Venezuelan electorate. Things can and must get better in Venezuela, but going back to the way things were will not help matters at all. The European Union’s support for the new Venezuela is the best way to prevent provocative and violent acts on the part of both the government and the political opposition, but unwarranted nostalgia leads only to disaster.</p>

Nevertheless we find less than credible the much delayed decision by the Venezuelan National Electoral Council to reject 1.2 million out of 3 million signatures on the recall referendum; two in five signatures have actually been declared invalid. We understand the wave of protest and disturbances in Venezuela in the wake of that decision. Nevertheless, we reject unconditionally the use of violence and deeply deplore the loss of human lives. We express our sympathy with the victims of that violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the National Electoral Commission to accept and adopt forthwith the recommendations of the Organisation of American States Observation Mission and the Carter Centre in relation to their preliminary report.

Apparently, this was not to the liking of the United States, the local plutocracy or the European Union, which is maintaining an indulgent silence. They even went as far as organising a coup d’état in order to oust President Chavez and his government, but they failed thanks to the decisive intervention of the people of Venezuela themselves. A new attack is unfolding at this time. The opposition has made a huge effort to collect signatures, but I wonder where it submitted the petition, which was a failure in that most of the signatures proved to be forged. And now the opposition is crying that it has been discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">The time when the imperialists imposed dictatorships everywhere has passed. The people of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, of the whole of Latin America are stepping up their fight for democracy and social change. To all these peoples we express our solidarity and undivided support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the European Commission is pleased that Parliament has presented an initiative on this issue. The serious political crisis in Venezuela and its serious economic consequences are a cause of concern to the Commission, which is closely following how events develop.</p>
<p class="contents">The political stability of Venezuela is essential not only to the development of this country but also to the security of the Andean region and the whole of Latin America. Venezuela needs international support in order to achieve a peaceful and democratic solution to the internal conflict without this having to mean interference in the country's internal affairs. The Commission therefore welcomed the beginning of dialogue between the government and the opposition and supported the facilitation of this dialogue by the tripartite group consisting of the Organisation of American States, the Carter Centre and the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We also supported the signature of the Declaration against Violence and for Peace and Democracy in Venezuela, in February 2003, and the agreement of 29 May of that same year. This agreement offered opportunities for achieving a peaceful, democratic, constitutional and electoral solution as advocated both by the Organisation of American States in its Permanent Council Resolution 833, and by the European Union, an idea which we continue to support.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the National Electoral Council organised a collection of signatures to call for recall referendums and the opposition set out to collect the signatures. In parallel, supporters of the government also collected signatures to recall certain representatives of the National Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the concern expressed by the Organisation of American States and the Carter Centre in its declaration of 2 March last and is fearful of the possible consequences of the decision of the National Electoral Council to subject 876 000 signatures for the presidential referendum considered doubtful to validation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fears that this may represent an insuperable obstacle to an electoral solution or affect the results of the process. Nevertheless, we would urge the opposition to submit to this process of validation and the government and the National Electoral Council to guarantee the defence of the popular will in such a way that it can be expressed by means of an electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets the climate of violence that has been created, the loss of human lives and many injured and urges the parties to apply the Declaration against Violence and for Peace and Democracy, which they themselves agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has published several statements on the need to seek a peaceful, democratic, constitutional and electoral solution and we have also given the Organisation of American States economic support in its efforts to apply the May agreement and we are prepared, if necessary, to examine how the support can be increased if that organisation requests it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in response to certain questions put, if the National Electoral Council decides to hold the referendum and the Venezuelan authorities invite the European Union, the Commission would be prepared to send an exploratory mission of electoral observers if it is advisable, useful and feasible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is tantamount to unacceptable meddling and pressure on the Venezuelan National Electoral Council. We must not forget the short-lived military coup of 11 and 12 April 2002, promptly supported by the Spanish presidency of the European Council, the failed embargo on oil extraction and the continued attempts at economic and social destabilisation of the country. All of this was carried out by the captains of industry and by sectors connected with the oligarchy that has exploited the Venezuelan people over recent decades, and which was actively and brazenly encouraged and supported by the US administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic and patriotic process is enshrined in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which was adopted in a referendum with the broad support of the people. In recent years, this process has sought to address the deep-rooted causes of inequality in Venezuela, and has responded to the most pressing needs of the overwhelming majority of the population. What Venezuela needs is support and solidarity with this process. We have always shown and shall continue to show such solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
