<p class="contents">I would remind the European Parliament that, eighteen months ago, a specific action plan promoting mobility was agreed and a number of these important promotional measures concerned the need for coordination and cooperation between social security systems, but not just that.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of mobility is directly linked to competitiveness, to job creation and to social cohesion and it essentially forms the precondition to a real European job market.</p>
<p class="contents">During the previous years’ application of this regulation, its provisions have proven to be exceptionally complicated, long-winded and unwieldy. Thus, the system no longer responds to new developments in the Member States’ social security systems or to the new mobility conditions in the European Union. In other words, this regulation urgently needs to be simplified and updated and this is precisely the aim of the Commission proposal. Simplification will result in Community legislation which is more comprehensible to the citizens for whose sake it is created.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards updating, I should like to highlight three basic amendments. The first concerns the personal aspect of the regulation. The proposed regulation will apply not only to workers who move but also to all citizens of the European Union covered by the social security legislation of a Member State. Freedom of movement cannot only benefit workers; it must benefit all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation, and this is the second amendment, aims to broaden the material aspect of the application of coordination rules. Thus, the social insurance sectors include new forms of benefits, such as early retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The third important amendment proposed by the Commission concerns unemployment benefits for cross-frontier workers. The Commission proposes that cross-frontier workers should receive benefits from the state in which they last worked. This is important in order to put an end to the complicated and unsatisfactory distinction between full and part-time employment of both typical and atypical cross-frontier workers. Every year the Commission receives thousands of protests from workers who work in one country and live in another and who are frequently subject to discrimination due to the inefficient coordination of social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we believe that this proposal will help not only to update the system, which is necessary, but also to simplify it, so that it functions more smoothly both for the citizens and the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, as we have been hearing, Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is the mechanism for the coordination of social security systems between Member States, not their harmonisation. For example, it is the regulation which gives you the right to reimbursement of emergency health care costs when you are taken ill in another Member State, providing you have your E111 form with you, as I am sure all of us here do.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis of the regulation is to provide those people from one Member State living or working in another with the same right to social security provision as a national living in that Member State. It is parity of treatment. It does not mean that your national system comes with you – which is something that people do not understand – but that you switch to the new system, where you should be treated on an equal footing with others.</p>
<p class="contents">In amending this regulation, we are constrained by a strict legal base within the Treaties and by numerous Court of Justice rulings about the scope of the regulation: definitions of social security and not social welfare in general, for example. It is true to say that as a committee we found this a frustration.</p>
<p class="contents">The inability to build bridges between national systems is problematic and it leads many people to feel poorly served when gaps appear between the systems. They feel it is Europe's job to provide those bridges.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the three main issues we are told that advice services deal with is that of people who have resigned from their job in order to move to another country with their partner or spouse and who lose entitlement to unemployment benefits by doing so; hence Amendments Nos 2 and 43 from the committee. Member States could help by recognising this as a valid reason for unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard, the Commission's proposals aim to simplify and modernise the regulation. The Council has been working through those proposals since 1999 and Parliament has followed the workings with a view to cooperation where there is progress for people and where it aligns with ECJ rulings.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have also looked to signal where there are problems and seek solutions where possible within the regulation's limited scope. I have been very grateful for that cooperation with both the Council and the Commission and, of course, for the very supportive cooperation of colleagues within the committee. We have a mutual desire to see the necessary revision of the regulation within this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee supports the extension of the scope of Regulation 1408/71. We support the move to include pre-retirement benefits for however long they continue to exist, given current moves to extend working lives, and paternity benefits. The majority of the committee deeply regrets that a weak legal base has meant that the extended family definition we wish to see in Amendment No 20 is so problematic. We look forward to seeing a progressive solution being found in the Council in its response to the European Parliament's vote on the Santini report. If this persists it is the view of many of us that we shall see cases brought before the European Court concerning the lack of mutual recognition of marital status for same-sex couples.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee is pleased, however, that in the European Year of People with Disabilities there appears to be progress on the cross-border export of certain disability benefits. I appreciate the action of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten in bringing forward the proposed new Article 55, which is supported by many political groups. This means that Amendment No 42, the committee's bridging, and, to some extent, warning amendment, can be replaced by Amendment No 55.</p>
<p class="contents">The lives of many disabled people have been made an absolute misery by the current situation in which disability benefits cannot be exported. These people have not been able to exercise their freedom of movement because they cannot afford to.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area where the work of colleagues has been very helpful has been on the subject of frontier workers who face particular difficulties in juggling two systems. The revised text of recital 4 makes a particular reference to the taxation issue. I want to make the point here that this is a reference and not an attempt to harmonise taxation across the European Union. It points out that there are difficulties faced which need resolution, even though this regulation may not be the place to do it. It is a problem that can only increase as some Member States merge their tax and social security payment systems, and where people may find that they are paying twice for a service that they can only receive once.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments concerning Articles 57 and 59 also pick up on the need to deal with potential problems before they affect individuals, and are indeed linked to previous European Parliament decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned earlier, the scope of the regulation is limited: it cannot answer all questions relating to frontier workers or access to healthcare, particularly when this is currently dealt with under the Treaties as a set of goods and services rather than universal social service. We can, however, aim to ensure that the regulation is as clear and comprehensive as possible so that employers cannot side-step their obligations to their employees and ask them, for example, to become self-employed to avoid payment of social security. The regulation should be a support to free movement, not a barrier, and we hope that our joint work will lead in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, today's regulation is a milestone in our history. We want to modernise, we want to simplify and we have been working on that for more than 10 years now. It looks as if we are now nearing the end today, in the first reading. Please excuse me, Mrs Lambert – I would normally thank the rapporteur first, but this time I would like to commend the Commission services, firstly Director Rob Cornelissen, who has not only convinced the Council but has also supported us with his advice and actions, and our other colleagues and in particular Herwig Verschueren, who also made a major contribution. That is not all, Madam President; I will be coming back to that shortly. Amendments have been submitted by all groups in Parliament. What we want is for this regulation to be ready in time for the coming enlargement. That is absolutely essential. Furthermore, the social security regulation is being established through the codecision procedure, while the Council is demanding unanimity. The IGC changes that, and quite rightly so. I am now going to list its blessings. The scope of applicability of the regulation has been extended. Everyone living in the territory of the Member State legally will now be treated equally. In other words, they will have the same rights and obligations as citizens of the Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, acquired rights will be preserved for all time. The export of rights in the context of social security has now been established clearly and unambiguously for the first time, even if only certain periods are insured in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the rules on pensions are being greatly simplified. The arrangements for early retirement, which have caused problems for so many people, will also, where such problems still exist, be included in the coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is more clarity regarding the rights of people who fall ill abroad. If acute help is needed abroad, then everyone has the same rights. Furthermore, we would very much welcome an amendment in which the requirement for permission to go abroad for medical treatment is amended to reflect the most recent decisions of the Court. In other words – incidentally, there is a grammatical error in the English text – no special permission is needed for outpatient care, although it would be needed for in-patient care.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-border workers. The retired cross-border worker maintains his rights in the country in which he worked. What is new is that cross-border workers’ family members are also getting rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment. Opportunities for the unemployed are being improved; the unemployed will be able to look for work abroad under certain conditions without losing benefits. Incidentally, my colleagues and I have submitted an amendment on that point; I would like the Council to say a unanimous ‘‘yes’ to an amendment that gives Luxembourg a transitional period of five years, as it is particularly affected by the new regulation because of the large number of cross-border workers there. They will then have the opportunity to adapt to the new benefits system in the country in which they are working and availability for the labour market there. There are also amendments on the provision of living allowances, and so on. The new text for Article No 55 – which Mrs Lambert has already mentioned – is much better and I hope that it will receive support.</p>
<p class="contents">The eighth point; people with disabilities will no longer lose their benefits when they move to a Member State. I am very pleased about that, especially in the Year of the Disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">The ninth point; not immediately obvious but nonetheless of importance is the paragraph that establishes that where problems exist, the Member States can no longer drag these out but are required to find actual solutions within a specific time.</p>
<p class="contents">Two brief points; the first is the question of homosexual marriage, an issue that has been much discussed. Is the Commissioner of the opinion that the coordination regulation is the right place to compel the thirteen Member States that do not recognise the marriage of homosexual couples and have not incorporated it in their family law to do so via the regulation? Would Amendment No 20 not cause the regulation to run into problems? I do have sympathy for Amendment No 49.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have not sorted out a problem that occurs where a social security system is subject to the country of employment principle, but tax legislation is not in step with it. That is another point where I would like to see a logical arrangement. All in all, however, I am very satisfied with the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Weiler (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, making the European labour market possible is in fact the goal of all the Member States, and, since 1971, we have also had an instrument for this purpose, that being Regulation No 1408. How, though, do things stand in practice? A number of Member States have set up various obstacles and allowed them to remain in place. That is why I am glad that the long-overdue reform of Regulation 1408 is at last on the table. Had it not been for this nonsensical unanimity rule in the Council, it would have been there much sooner.</p>
<p class="contents">That notwithstanding, we have proved that we are capable of coping, shortly before the end of the parliamentary term, not only with enlargement, but also with giving a social policy reform greater depth.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing to be said about it is that it makes everything simpler, which is what both the public and Parliament want, and it also incorporates rulings by the European Court of Justice on such things as the entitlement to medical services. Secondly, there are also qualitative reforms, and this House and the committee have encouraged and emboldened the Commission to formulate these as such. They include, for example, the right of unemployed people to remain in Europe for up to six months for the purpose of seeking work; this involves family members and people who are no longer involved in economic activity being included in the scope of the Regulation. It involves all these things, because we are of course inviting to Europe not only workers but also their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I am especially glad that we have made a special arrangement for people with disabilities, something that the Council was initially unwilling to accept. I hope that we will now be able to reach a compromise. What is important is that nobody who wants to avail themselves of the mobility option and whom we wish to support in their desire to do so, should fall through the social security system’s net. It is also important that we should reiterate that this is about coordination and about the acknowledgement of entitlements, and not about the transfer of social benefits from one state to another.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also, of course, a number of conflicts – not with Mrs Lambert, whom I thank for her cooperation, and nor even that much with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, apart from the point relating to families, which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has just mentioned. Some Member States take a very narrow view of what constitutes a family – I would say they have a twentieth-century view of it – whilst others have a more modern approach in line with the twenty-first. What we, in fact, regard as important is that this definition, when we decide on one, will have no legal significance in terms of the Regulation, and that we will not be enforcing some sort of acceptance of a lifestyle on any Member State. For that reason, we should perhaps show a bit more tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that it matters a great deal both to me and to my group that we should now – great and important though this reform is – keep this Regulation open-ended. There will without doubt be more cases in which we will have to get involved, particularly when we are joined by ten new Member States next year, when we will gain experience and perhaps have to make more changes. It is for this reason that we also support the Commission’s idea of flexible action in areas that are left open and also of regulating those matters that have not been sorted out, such as taxation and the occasional possibility of double taxation – which will perhaps happen in the next legislative period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all want citizens to be able to really demand justice in the free movement of workers. This has not been a success to date. Just one look at the statistics shows us that only around 2% of the citizens work in another country. However, I should in this respect also like to deliver a few notes of discord which do not concern Parliament. Once again, we have managed to work well with the fellow MEPs. As Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has stated, work with the European Commission was also perfectly feasible. I did, however, see it as a sword of Damocles that the European Council is threatening to call it a day after all if we do not bring our requirements under control. I find this hard to take, certainly where frontier work is concerned. I should like to underpin this with a few examples. In my area, which is between the Belgian border zone – in which I live – and the Netherlands, the opportunity is currently presenting itself to deploy 800 workers at a large company, Volvo, just across the border. People will certainly be recruited from my area. I still, however, hesitate to advise people to actually do this unless 100% guarantees can be given concerning sound and proper social security. I find it impossible to explain to, for example, a 62-year old lady who has become disabled, that she will lose her disability pension in Belgium and will not qualify for old-age pension in the Netherlands until she reaches the age of 65. These are all situations that cannot be accounted for because there is insufficient coordination at the moment. For that reason, we have all joined forces and tabled yet a few more amendments to avoid scenarios of this kind in future. With these amendments, we want to force the institutions and the Member States to coordinate their efforts more effectively. The amendments tabled by us, fortunately by a number of groups together, pertain to very specific cases which often affect frontier workers. This receives my support. In my view, it is unacceptable for the Member States not to be able, and willing, to acknowledge this problem. Surely we cannot have a situation where a united Europe is being sabotaged because a number of national officials and politicians treat frontier work as a marginal issue. I am therefore pleased that in its proposal, the European Commission is making every effort to enforce cooperation by the Member States. As soon as this regulation has been adopted, I hope that it will actually be enforced, and I would urge the Commission to see that it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main aim of the report is to ensure that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights. For those of us in this Parliament who hope that cultural and human exchanges increase in the context of the free movement of persons, this report really is a step in the right direction. The simplification of regulations, coordination, the harmonisation of procedures based on the application of the principle of equal treatment, which gives employees or self-employed persons from other Member States the same rights as the citizens of the state responsible, all contribute to European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Some measures contained in the report are particularly noteworthy. Personally, I find that they are very much in step with the changes that have taken place in our societies. I am thinking in particular of the desire to treat maternity and paternity equally, the proposal seeking to include third-country nationals in the directive’s scope, and even the definition of the term ‘member of the household’ applying to unmarried partners in a long-term relationship, irrespective of sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I, together with my group, do support this report, I wish, Commissioner, to underline the paradox between the stated desires and the dangers of adopting measures less comprehensive than those provided by the social security systems in several European countries. France, Italy and Germany, for example, are about to implement or have already implemented reforms intended to break up existing social security systems, on the pretext that they have excessive budgetary deficits in terms of the Maastricht criteria. By extending the sphere of operations of private bodies, we will be moving towards a reduction of national assistance or even its total disappearance, which could prove extremely dangerous for the future. And yet, the principles and aims underpinning the creation of social security systems in Europe still apply, in the context of developing a European social model that has proved itself by enabling growth and improved living standards for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that these aims are all the more necessary given the increase in levels of precarity and poverty in Europe today. According to a recent Eurostat study, 15% of the Union’s inhabitants are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. If you take away all social transfers, this figure rises to 24% and the situation is in danger of worsening. The question facing us in Europe today goes far beyond establishing coordination, even though this is clearly crucial. What we are faced with is a real societal choice. Do we want a model of economic and social development that is equitable and provides assistance, which will enable us to stimulate growth, or will we take the route of allowing all social systems to disappear, at the risk of allowing the number of people in a precarious situation, the poor and the marginalised to skyrocket? Choosing the first option would require a genuine form of European social governance to be established, based on a form of downward harmonisation. This would clearly also involve reviewing the Maastricht criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two names have been mentioned: Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mrs Lambert, sitting next to her. I should like to take this opportunity to join in thanking them. As Mrs Oomen-Ruijten said, if you want to assess something in a historical framework, this can be done in two ways. Historically, we have been given a patchwork of provisions, a patchwork of adaptations, of a coordinating directive, No 1408/71, with its later amendments. We also have a catalogue of problems. It is then very good if we can make a little progress. This could represent a historical step forward. The historical vantage point should perhaps be a next step, but I shall come to this in a moment. I should first like to take stock of what we all have actually managed to achieve. I think that it is quite favourable in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten stated before, that we have achieved a number of things that are already acceptable to the Council and to the Commission. These issues concern, for example, the inclusion of stateless persons and refugees, or regulations, or improvements should I say, in the field of bureaucratic obstacles to frontier work, and we could go on like this for a while. Quite a few problems nevertheless remain, as everyone knows. Only 2% of the European population carries out cross-border work in some form or other. If you engage in conversation with frontier workers, as has already been mentioned in the form of personal recollections, they will tell you that the problems know no bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also keeping a few issues open, and I think that we should take the following historical steps at some point. If we only consider the definition of families, then we will not solve the issue; we have to try to solve this by referring to the Santini report. Or if we look at a number of other issues related to family reunifications and benefits, etc., then one thing is very clear. We are now talking about improving the coordination of these systems; we are talking about modernising them and we are doing this against the backdrop of workers' mobility in Europe and a better-functioning labour market. In future, and this would be a historical step, we will still need to move towards some form of harmonisation, because we will otherwise fail to solve other problems, as the social security systems are under pressure in every Member State and, in actual fact, come into conflict with each other, which leads to the further development of this patchwork. I would like to see an end put to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to compliment the Commission and the Commission staff for their assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of movement has been one of the core tenets of the single market. If this is to be a reality rather than an illusion, then the opportunity to move with social security benefit, with guaranteeing rights of social security, must be seized. Over the past few years there have been many moves to bring about a resolution to what seemed to be an intractable problem. I believe that the Council and the Commission text, as well as some of the proposals coming from this House, offer the best possible solution for ensuring that people who are forced or who wish to move across different countries can be secure in the rights to their benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the difficulties we have faced over the last number of years with this regulation has been its complexity, not just for the individual who wishes to benefit from it, but also for the authorities that are forced to interpret it. One of the great things we have done so far in our work with Mrs Lambert and others has been to abridge that text, make it simple and readable.</p>
<p class="contents">More needs to be done but we have gone a long way towards that end.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the difficulties I have with some of the amendments being put forward is the question of harmonisation. As Mrs Lambert says in her own report, the fundamental principle here is about coordinating national systems, not replacing them. We have seen in other areas of work in the European Union that coordination achieves quicker and better results for the individual than merely trying to enforce harmonisation. Therefore I would have to oppose some of the amendments seeking tax harmonisation and also the equal right to unemployment benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would make is on the question of the definition of the family. Again, this presents difficulties in many countries where certain types of unions and certain types of marriages are not recognised. We have to ensure that national legislation is applied in those areas. We can see advances being made in every country towards coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues raised in Amendment No 38 in particular can best be dealt with in the context of the newly implemented regulation, and we should leave it at that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ensuring that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights and consequently coordinating national social security legislation is, therefore, a crucial element, as a number of my fellow Members have said. I am thus convinced that social security systems that function harmoniously and in a coordinated way are valuable assets for European societies. Acquired rights, the policy of simplifying pre-retirement benefits, clarification of sickness benefits, the assets that our colleagues have suggested in the field of handicaps, are the basic building blocks for improving this report, which addresses in particular the social protection of frontier workers and of those who move around within our territory. Even if those only represent a small percentage of the population as a whole, the problems that they face clearly warrant our full attention. On this matter, I have a specific example in mind: I remember inviting to Paris some Belgian doctors, who had practised in their country for 20 years. When they arrived at the social security office in Paris, they were told they had lost their rights. This shows that we must welcome this text.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, some of the amendments contained in this report appear to be somewhat problematic. I am thinking in particular of Amendment No 3 and of extending the regulation’s scope, which I do not feel would be appropriate given the potential financial impact of such a measure. As for Amendment No 20, I believe it disrupts the balance of the regulation for no good reason. This is why I believe that Parliament must be reasonable and accept Amendment No 49, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten suggested a short while ago in her speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can dream of greater labour mobility and of lifting internal borders for those looking for work. For those who are actually involved in movement of this kind, the reality is often a nightmare. Few feel up to the task. Labour mobility in Europe is far too rare and far too little attention is given to those who do take the plunge. To the politicians in the capital cities, these people are often treated as a marginal issue that takes place at the national fringes, away from the hub. We, European politicians and policy makers, often hear the comment that we should not get involved in social security because it is a national issue. We should only confine ourselves to Regulation 1408/71. This Regulation, as its name suggests, is more than 30 years old and has become more ambiguous as time has gone on. Moreover, it took five years before there was some kind of agreement within the Council about the simplification proposal that the Commission submitted in 1998. This has been a laborious process and has not by any means reached completion, but, fortunately, clear guidelines have now been drafted for it. Since these have already been mentioned by others, I will not repeat them. I greatly value the work that the Commission and the Council's working parties have carried out and, needless to say, also our rapporteur, Jean Lambert, who has entered into very extensive consultations with these other bodies. Nevertheless, many problems still persist. I have the impression that we have solved many of those problems thanks to our amendments that have often been drafted in line with the Commission and the Council. However, there are two other important bottlenecks that affect the practical side of things.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important to know what Member States will actually introduce within the scope of the Regulation and what exceptions and excuses they will dream up in order to circumvent the provisions. For that reason, the application regulation and annexes are of major importance. These have not been presented to us to date, but are being prepared in the Council. In my view, we should most definitely take this into consideration when we settle on our final opinion. As far as this is concerned, the Member States have been warned and, together with our colleagues in the national parliaments, we will keep a close eye on our ministers and council representatives in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the problems in practice often touch upon other rules and regulations which do not strictly fall within the scope of the Regulation. This is in the case where, for example, in social security regulations, age limits are used or definitions for people for whom derived rights exist, that are based on family law in the Member States. Or something which is quite common in the Netherlands, combinations of general social security regulations which serve as a basis, alongside additional regulations that fall outside of the scope of the Regulation. Fiscal regulations are another major problem area. European coordination rules are lacking. There are only bilateral agreements between Member States, and these are often at odds with these fiscal regulations and fail to comply with the rules in the Regulation. This is a huge problem, particularly for the frontier workers who live in one EU country and work in another. The Commission has assured us that those problems cannot all be solved within the Regulation and this is why we have shifted a number of amendments from the articles to the recitals. This, however, does not mean that the Commission and the Council should take them less seriously. I should like to add this quite emphatically. On these points too, I expect the Commission – this may be a new Commission – to actually take powerful initiatives in the fullness of time, because it is at least as important to solve these problems as those in the current Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It means, indeed, that many people do not even try to do so. In actual fact, there are only 1 000 people who commute across the Danish/German border in spite of the fact that unemployment south of the border stands at 12%, and north of the border is as low as 6%. There are obviously linguistic barriers to taking up work on the other side of the border, but the different ways in which the tax and social security systems are set up are also of very great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">What of course distinguishes Denmark is that we fund our social security systems across the border via the general taxation system, while in the rest of the EU more use is made of earmarked social security contributions. This has a role to play in creating part of the problem we experience. I should not, in a way, mind it if we in Denmark were to obtain reforms whereby future payments were better at reflecting the individual’s responsibility for the common good and whereby the costs of social security arrangements were made clearer, that is to say through an increase in the number of earmarked contributions. Such reforms could also reduce the problems posed by the Danish social security system in relation to other countries’ systems.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not, of course, at present on the agenda, however. We are concerned here with simplifying the coordination of the social security arrangements between the Member States, and there is a great need to simplify these very complex rules which, over the years, have become progressively more complex.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Lambert for the work she has done. I am in favour of Parliament seeking to cooperate with the Council on these issues and seeking to work in tandem with it. We must not delay the reforms unnecessarily. I believe it would be easier to get the reforms through before, rather than after, enlargement. We must not, therefore, be so focused upon the ideal that we fail to obtain a workable solution right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, is thus of the greatest importance, and I congratulate her.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that nobody should fall outside the existing social security systems of the European Union, including third-country nationals, though that issue has been dealt with elsewhere. I also believe, however, that there should not be a comprehensive list of social security regimes covered by coordination in this case. This will give us room to make additions later on, as and when problems arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that the Commission’s own proposals and innovations, aimed at updating the regulation (which, as we know, dates from 1971), are to be welcomed. We must go further, though, without forgetting the regulation’s four principles, as the rapporteur points out. I would lay particular emphasis on certain proposals aimed at improving the draft presented to Parliament, above all: the recognition that people leaving employment in one Member State for family reasons should not consequently lose the right to unemployment benefit in their new country of residence; the extension of the provisions to refugees, stateless persons and their families resident in Member States; definitions of frontier workers, refugees and stateless persons and their rights, although those rights should also be extended to their families; recognition of the rights of retired frontier workers, the extension of the concept of the family and the inclusion of paternity leave; the improved situation of people with disabilities, which has already been mentioned, preventing them from temporary loss of entitlement to disability benefits or from having to claim those benefits afresh; the opportunity, also afforded here, for two or more Member States to conclude conventions with each other based on the principles and in the spirit of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only regret, however, the various attempts to undermine the social security systems of different Member States, mine in particular. This could jeopardise the true reach of several of the rights we are upholding here. That is why I am calling for these proposals to be taken into account, and also for all attempts to undermine the social security systems of the Member States be reviewed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have often thought that this report was going to outlast her mandate, for that is nearly how long it has been on the table. This was not due to a lack of diligence on her part, for that was, in fact, immense, but rather due to insufficient diligence on the part of the Council. Mrs Oomen-Ruijten rightly pointed out that it was not as a result of any lack of diligence on the part of the Commission. This suggests that we are dealing with a very difficult issue politically speaking. Why? Because a great deal of money is involved. That is the first reason.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, in everyday life, the Member States do not for one moment consider the people that might break out of their own mould from time to time. They actually assume that everyone remains in their own country, from the day they were born until they die. They, in fact, find it highly inconvenient if that status quo is upset when people move abroad. They may be prepared to take certain measures, but as few and as little as possible, and they then try to snatch back as much as they can. If there is any bother with the budget, then those are the people who are tackled first. That is why the Regulation is also used to limit rights rather than to increase them. Anyone who would like to study this more in-depth should come and have a look at what has happened in the Netherlands and Belgium on this score, where neither country is particularly blameless.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to raise another matter, which is the issue over which there is still a difference of opinion, namely the issue of tax and social security. In fact, I think that Mrs Jensen has already made a very valid point on this matter. She also gave one of the best examples in Denmark, because all social security over there is covered by taxes. What is annoying is that in some cases, people pay taxes in one country and social security contributions in another. As, for example, social security contributions are relatively high in Belgium and non-existent in Denmark, at least in the form of contributions, you are extremely unfortunate if you pay tax in Denmark and social security in Belgium. If the reverse is true, of course, you are extremely fortunate. You then pay relatively little in taxes in Belgium and receive an awful lot of social benefits in Denmark. That is therefore a matter which needs re-addressing and which remains an issue. This is not harmonisation, but it is important that the two types of taxes should be treated in the same way, at least in one and the same country, and this is an issue which really deserves an all-out effort on our part. If we do not solve it, we will never bring about a sound labour market in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This text has been streamlined and updated and takes account of the rulings of the Court of Justice, but also of the current realities of employment and of certain types of self-employed workers. In my opinion, we must welcome the text and call for this work to be concluded before the end of the year, before enlargement takes place, because this will make progress easier to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">In the little speaking time left to me, I should like to focus on one issue: the situation of frontier workers. These are truly Europeans par excellence; it is they who suffer as a result of differences in legislation and who least understand the steps forward Europe is taking, and yet they are the ones for whom everything possible should be done, to enable them to perform their jobs across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, the progress that has been made is clear to see. I wish, however, to emphasise the need to research new forms of working together, new forms of institutional cooperation between Member States, when problems in implementing these regulations persist, particularly in cases where there are differences in their implementation. There are many such differences and there are also many delays in harmonising these.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this fundamental issue, proposals have been tabled in Amendments Nos 51 and 52, on which we will vote tomorrow. I believe that this issue of coordination will require ongoing effort and fine-tuning. Today, coordination is necessary in that responsibility in these fields falls to the Member States. This does not mean, however, that we should not raise the necessary issue of harmonisation in order to protect the European social model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is done to a minimal degree, however, and never with a view to bringing each country’s social legislation into line with the national legislation that is most favourable to workers. Some amendments tabled by the European Parliament improve the Council proposal for a regulation and we will be voting for them but how can we talk about these few changes without condemning the policy currently being pursued by the European States, the general thrust of which is to weaken the social protection of workers, to reduce pensions, to increase social security contributions whilst reducing benefits: in short, what we are seeing in most European countries? Whether this situation develops gradually or overnight, life is becoming impossible for low-paid workers, self-employed workers and the unemployed to support themselves properly. Access to care is increasingly becoming a privilege of the wealthy. This is an outrage.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, furthermore, should we have this political guideline when national prosperity is increasing, admittedly slowly but increasing nonetheless? In France, for example, we are told that social security is in deficit. Why is this so? Partly due to unemployment, a situation for which the workers are not responsible and of which they are in fact the victims. Mainly, however, because the State is digging into the social security coffers in order to bestow gifts on employers through reducing social costs.</p>
<p class="contents">What governments call pension reform or social security reform is basically large-scale plunder from workers to the benefit of a few wealthy parasites. In any event, I wish to use this speaking time to state that European workers have the moral right to defend themselves, to strike and to demonstrate because they have no other way of opposing what is actually nothing less than organised theft. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle of simplifying and modernising social security rules to make them more efficient and user-friendly certainly deserves support. However, although I am sympathetic to a number of the points she raises, in certain respects I suggest that her proposals go too far.</p>
<p class="contents">I am against Amendment Nos 1, 44 and 45, as they include references to taxation. I hear what various colleagues have said on this subject and particularly welcome the comments made by the rapporteur herself, that this regulation might not be the right place to address that. I agree with that point. Regulation 1408/71 is about coordinating social security, which derives its legal base from Article 42, which is not concerned with taxation at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand why some colleagues would wish to extend the scope of this regulation into the field of tax, but this is not a Community competence and should not become one by the back door or indeed the front door. If these amendments are passed I would hope that the Commission might still reject them. I invite the Commissioner to reflect further on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also against Amendment Nos 2 and 43 concerning payment of unemployment benefits, both of which only just scraped through in committee. The rules in Regulation 1408 must provide a balance between encouragement of labour mobility and avoidance of abuse. The term 'family reason' in the amendment is, in my view, too vague. EU citizens do and should have the right to seek employment in any Member State. For them to seek unemployment benefit in a Member State without having worked there and for the EU to endow them with rights to benefit, irrespective of individual Member State rules is just not reasonable. I understand the problem but this is not the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be recommending support for many of the rapporteur's other amendments, but for the reasons I have mentioned above, I cannot recommend approval of her overall report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For over 30 years we have been waiting for this work to be done. The amount of progress that has been made is a credit to Mrs Lambert, the Commission and the staff on both sides, and indeed the other groups in this House. Certainly those whose task it is to implement the Regulation will welcome its simplification, because it is a minefield for those who have to interpret the various court judgments that have been laid over the actual regulation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It has repeatedly been said that this is about coordination. It is true that it is not about harmonisation. I would argue, however, that it should eventually be about harmonisation. We are sticking our heads in the sand if we think we can create a European labour market if we do not move ultimately towards harmonisation, both of our social welfare systems and of our tax systems. It is a nonsense to think that we can go beyond the current 2% of movement to a real movement of labour if we do not get serious about this issue. Its purpose is to extend and to modernise. I particularly welcome the changes that were made in relation to commuting workers whose lives will be made a lot less stressful as a result of the changes that have been achieved here.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I welcome the indication from the Irish Government which intends to prioritise an agreement on this proposal during the course of its presidency. Hopefully it will not have to deal with it, because the Italian presidency will already have done so. At any rate, I look forward to it being concluded by the time this Parliament ends in June 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For a long time now, thanks to a previous amendment of Regulation 1408, many pensioners who are in financial difficulties due to illness or disability have been unable to draw their pension or illness allowance when they change their country of residence within the 15 Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 42 to Article 27a of Mrs Lambert’s report is concerned with addressing this issue, stating that, until the new state of residence starts to pay the allowance provided for by its own law, it is the previous state of residence which is to pay this allowance until the disabled person starts to draw it from the new state of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment to Article 55, however, tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Pronk, Mrs Lambert herself, Mr Hughes and others, states clearly that, if the new state of residence – France, for example – does not provide for such allowances, the allowance is not to be paid. I therefore fear that, although I do not believe this is the wish of the majority of the Parliamentary committee or of Parliament, if these amendments are both adopted, the citizens of any Member State moving within the European Union will continue to be without a pension.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have misinterpreted the intention conveyed by the Italian translation. I reserve the right to clarify this point with the rapporteur and I hope that the regulation will be a genuine step forward in the protection of European workers who move within the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know people who have run into difficulties because they have taken up work in two different countries, and it is therefore crucial to emphasise that people have not, as a matter of simple fact, been given the right promised to them since the Common Market was founded. It is therefore quite natural that we should break down the barriers that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must also acknowledge that there is probably no regulation that has been more demonised than this one. Over the years, opponents of the EU in my own, and other, countries have used it to give people the impression that our social security would be harmonised, that we should be forced to change our social security systems or even that our national pension schemes would be abolished. I must of course deplore the fact that these people have not appeared in the House today to engage in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise today that the Danish Social Democrats are not, in general, afraid of freedom of movement, and I certainly do not think that freedom of movement would undermine national social security arrangements, even if these would then apply to a wider circle of people. Neither practical experience nor calculations show that there would be hordes of people suddenly wanting to migrate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I also think it important for us to understand that, if unintended consequences arise – if, for example, too many contributions leave the country or if social security arrangements are shamelessly exploited – then we should definitely not look passively on but take action straight away. This is emphasised by Amendments Nos 10 and 52, in which we say that our countries can establish bilateral contacts – of the kind with which we are already familiar – and that we must talk to each other if someone runs into difficulties. That would, of course, also prevent all forms of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the Commissioners also today to emphasise at least three things in addition to what has been said in the House: firstly, that there is no question of harmonisation; secondly, that we shall not accept any form of deterioration whatsoever and shall step in if we see the systems weakened; and, thirdly, that we shall not accept unintended consequences and fraud. A fourth thing also to emphasise, of course, is that we cannot accept, as a result of this proposal, any impairment of the schemes we already have.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that is very important. I do not myself believe that this will happen. I do not for a moment believe that migration will be on a sufficiently large scale. I do, however, believe it important for people to have this emphasised to them by the Commissioner responsible, and I should be delighted, Commissioner, if you could do this for us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must congratulate the rapporteur on her report. In our view, the principle of free movement of persons between Member States is as important as the principles like the free movement of goods or of services. It could even be deemed more important than the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of persons differs from the other principles referred to in that it may be restricted, prevented or subject to conditions if the right to social security of persons moving within the European Union are not respected. Article 34 in Chapter IV of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, entitled Solidarity, lays down clearly the right to protection in a range of cases. These include maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency, old age and loss of employment, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices. Article 34 also lays down that everyone residing or moving legally within the European Union is entitled to social security benefits and social advantages in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We see the guiding principles of the regulation as being equality of treatment for citizens of other states and for national workers, regardless of whether the workers are self-employed or not, aggregating contribution periods in various countries if necessary, banning multiple payments and allowing social security to be transferred to other countries. This is what will promote freedom of movement and family reunification. It follows that we believe the proposed regulation should be welcomed. It will facilitate more widespread support and simplify earlier provisions. In addition, it is not intended as a replacement for national legislation. Rather, it aims to coordinate national systems in order to provide a better service and improve the support available to the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the years, various amendments have been made to this regulation that have made it extremely complex and some very positive developments have taken place in the social security systems of the various Member States, including my own.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts demonstrate the urgent need for this regulation to be reformed. The Commission’s proposal, which is to be welcomed, clearly sets out the aim to be attained: to coordinate social security systems with the prospect of enlargement in mind. This involves coordination and not harmonisation. The intention is to modernise and simplify the regulation and, in this context, a significant step forwards has been taken in various areas, in particular with regard to the rights of the unemployed, pensioners and frontier workers and their families. The list of types of social security covered by coordination has also been extended and measures are set out for solving the problem of double taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has really shown great commitment to the work on reforming this regulation and I congratulate her on this. I must state, however, that some of the proposals she has put forward raise difficulties, which meant that the PPE members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had to vote against the report. I shall confine myself to discussing one of them, which concerns the definition of the family: Each Member State recognises a particular concept of the family in accordance with its national legal system. It would not, therefore, be legitimate to impose any type of family model on the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Pronk and others have explained the taxation issue very well to those – within his own political group and elsewhere – who have concerns about it. This is an indication that there are issues which need to be looked at.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment Nos 44 and 45, I would urge Mr Bushill-Matthews, amongst others, to look at Amendment Nos 51 and 52 and to see if he cannot at least support them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards one or two comments on Article 3 and the scope of the regulation, if they are references to the issues about refugees and stateless people, then they are already included in the current regulation. This is not an addition but a rewording, because the original proposal – which was a rather elegant, all-embracing one from the Commission – had to be changed because the issue of third-country nationals was dealt with some time ago in a separate proposal under the able rapporteurship of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of moving for family reasons is included not least because, as I indicated, it is a question that the advice services say comes up very frequently. It was also the subject of a significant case in the Committee on Petitions. A British woman who moved from the UK in order to follow her husband in his work as a member of the armed forces discovered that she fell between two stools in terms of her entitlement to unemployment benefit. If she had known how to work the system better in terms of nuancing it, she would not have been caught by resigning four days before moving. Therefore, that particular issue is there because it affects a large number of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank colleagues for a very focused and informed debate. I hope we manage to get a very positive vote from Parliament tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for her excellent report, especially because in order to draw up this kind of report on this particular issue it is not enough to be a sensitive politician: one must be a very committed technocrat. It is such a complex and difficult area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and all other Members involved. They really have had to work hard, not only in terms of the complexity of the file, but also as regards the problems surrounding unanimity and the huge differences which exist from Member State to Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to repeat what Mrs Thorning-Schmidt repeatedly underlined: the whole effort aims to modernise and simplify the regulation. It is not a political exercise of harmonisation, which, for legal and political reasons, is totally impossible on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the Commission on the various amendments is as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept in full Amendment Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, as well as Amendment Nos 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, and 54, which aim either to clarify and to render more precise the Commission's proposal; or, via recitals, to draw attention to certain specific problems which cannot be solved by the rules on coordination of social security schemes; or to incorporate recent case-law of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts in part Amendment No 11, which concerns declarations to be made by the Member States about their legislation. However, the proposed text is too rigid. A yearly declaration would be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I understand and agree with the ideas behind Amendment Nos 38 and 40, the Commission cannot accept them because these provisions should figure in the implementing regulation instead.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 42, which would not amount to simplification at all. The Commission has sympathy for the philosophy behind the amendment. The same result can, however, be achieved in another way. This is exactly the objective of Amendment No 55, which the Commission can accept in full. This amendment is also in line with the proposal the Commission presented in July<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which concerns in particular the list of the so-called special non-contributory benefits, which are not exportable under the current regulation. The Commission's proposal aims to reduce the list of these special non-contributory benefits. The majority of the benefits which will be deleted from this list are disability benefits. It is important that this point has been underlined by many Members. The disability organisations are also satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has to reject Amendment No 1, which aims at coordination between taxation and social security schemes because there is no legal base for such harmonisation. The Commission could, however, envisage a recital that is worded in a different way. Therefore, the Commission can accept Amendment No 48.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 2 and 43 also have to be rejected by the Commission because there is no legal basis for such a provision. The coordination rules cannot require a Member State to guarantee the right to unemployment benefit to a person who decides to leave employment. We could, however, envisage a provision which reflects the philosophy of these amendments while respecting the limits of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, one of the effects of the Commission's proposal will be that unemployed frontier workers will receive unemployment benefits from the state of last employment, rather than from the state of residence as is currently the case. I am aware that this change might have considerable financial consequences for Luxembourg, which has a very large number of frontier workers residing in other Member States. A transitional period aimed at avoiding a sudden shock for Luxembourg seems reasonable. Therefore, the Commission can accept Amendment No 56.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 20 because it lies outside the scope of the coordination of the social security schemes. Only the applicable national legislation can determine who is a 'member of the family'. There were two particularly interesting comments from Mrs Weiler and Mrs Bastos on this point. I could agree with the philosophy behind these comments, and the modernisation of the sense and the definition of 'family', but we must take into account the fact that there is national legislation which defines and determines what a 'member of the family' is. For the same reason, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 49.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 27 is too rigid and could lead to problems of interpretation. It cannot be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 54 aims at guaranteeing a retired frontier worker the choice of obtaining health care either in the state of residence or in the state of last employment. Amendment No 41 has exactly the same objective. Although the conditions under which such a right is guaranteed differ in the two amendments, the Commission can accept either of the two.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, although there is a difference between Amendment No 50 and Amendment No 33 as regards the conditions under which the members of the family of a frontier worker are guaranteed a right to obtain health care in the state of employment of the worker, the Commission can accept either of the two amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards Amendment Nos 44 and 45, these cannot be accepted by the Commission because they are outside the scope of the rules on the coordination of social security schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendment Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 47, 48, 51, 52, 53, 55 and 56. It can accept either Amendment No 50 or Amendment No 33. It can accept either Amendment No 53 or Amendment No 36. It can accept in part Amendment No 11. It cannot accept Amendment Nos 2 or 43 as proposed, but could envisage another wording for these. It rejects Amendment Nos 1, 20, 27, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45 and 49 – I think this is the first time I have partly agreed with Mr Bushill-Matthews!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Lambert and the committee again for their cooperation and for their work on this issue, which is so important for European workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
