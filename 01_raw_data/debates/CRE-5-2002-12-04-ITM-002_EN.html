<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fabra Vallés,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Court of Auditors</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be able to present to you today the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I have organised my comments into four main sections: firstly, the analysis of budgetary management; secondly, the follow-up given to the Court’s previous observations; thirdly, the Statement of Assurance (DAS); and fourthly, the reform of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin with the analysis of the implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second consecutive year there has been a high budgetary surplus, greater than EUR 15 000 million (16% of the final budget). The surplus is due to the cancellation of appropriations caused mainly by the delay in the implementation of structural measures. It would have been appropriate to modify the budget to maintain the balance between the forecast expenditure and revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial feature of the budgetary management was the low rate of use of payment appropriations in certain areas. In the case of the Structural Funds, percentage of use was less then 70%, the lowest level since 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Delays were also a feature of the implementation of pre-accession aid, especially in the case of the SAPARD programme, where only 9.2% of the appropriations were disbursed. What is more, only EUR 1 million were received by the final beneficiaries of this programme. If the pace of implementation does not pick up, appropriations will have to be cancelled in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must continue its effort to clear the accounts by cancelling those commitments which can no longer be implemented. Outstanding commitments amount to EUR 12 000 million in the case of external aid and to nearly 3 000 million in the case of the new pre-accession instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The rate of implementation of the European Development Funds is just as sluggish. After four years, only 30% of appropriations under the 8th EDF have been disbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the estimates made for these programmes in terms of implementation and payments need to be more realistic and take account of each country's capacity to absorb aid. This would result in a more accurately calculated and balanced budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court has analysed the follow-up given to its previous observations. Generally speaking, the Commission has taken appropriate steps to remedy the shortcomings highlighted. For example, outward processing customs arrangements have been simplified, the legislation promoting joint enterprises in the fisheries sector has been improved and tendering procedures under the TACIS programme have been revised.</p>
<p class="contents">In other sectors developments have been less satisfactory. This is the case of the system of aid for durum wheat, where deficiencies that the Court pointed out in 1998 are still in evidence and some EUR 450 million are spent unnecessarily every year. This is also true of the Common Market Organisation for sugar, where, despite the 2001 reform, problems of overproduction and high prices persist.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Audit Progress Committee starts work, I am certain that the Commission will be able to be more diligent in following up the Court's reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now move on to the Statement of Assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the opinion of the Court that the accounts for 2001 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation of the Communities. However, the Report does express some reservations and observations which for the most part concern defects in the accounting system on which the Court has previously remarked.</p>
<p class="contents">In its reply to our Report, the Commission acknowledges these shortcomings and undertakes to present a plan to modernise the accounting system before the end of 2002. The Court will examine the conception and implementation of this plan and will keep Parliament informed of its progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As in previous years, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure are legal and regular. Nonetheless, because of the errors that we have highlighted we are unable to provide this assurance in respect of the other payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Most errors were detected in payments relating to agricultural policy and structural measures – in other words, in those management areas which the Commission shares with the Member States, and which account for some 80% of the budget. Reducing the frequency of errors will be contingent on significant improvements in the administration and control systems of both the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the common agricultural policy, where the declarations submitted by the beneficiaries of subsidies have not improved compared with previous years. The launch of the Integrated Management and Control System has not been completed, and almost half of the Member States have not introduced the bovine identification system, which has been compulsory since 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Other errors are linked to deficiencies in the controls carried out by the Member States (in the case, for example, of olive oil and cotton). The Court's recommendations obviously include the full implementation of the control mechanisms provided for in the Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards structural measures, further erroneous payments were discovered, caused by deficiencies in the control systems and in the Member States' declarations of expenditure. The Court is concerned about national governments' delay in applying the management and control instruments for the new programming period; the inspection units are not operational and there is no independent control of transactions. It recommends that the Commission intensify its checks and systematically turn the findings obtained to account.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of internal policies, which are directly managed by the Commission, examination of the fifth framework programme for research revealed incorrect payments due to the failure of beneficiaries to comply with contract provisions. The Court recommends simplifying the systems for reimbursing expenditure and introducing more effective sanction mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The national authorities in the beneficiary countries and non-governmental organisations play a decisive role in the management system for external aid programmes. Examination of the supporting documentation that is available centrally (in Brussels) leads to the conclusion that the Commission has legally and regularly met its commitments and payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Court has no assurance that these operations were carried out correctly in the beneficiary countries, where the control systems are inadequate and errors have often been detected on the spot. The Commission must work more intensively to transform external aid – where progress has already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this theme, I should like to open a short parenthesis. In recent months there has been lively debate concerning the Commission's accounting system. This is a good thing, and I hope that the interest thus aroused will help to push through the reforms that the Court has long been advocating. However, in some respects the debate has suffered from a lack of precision and balance. The time has come to introduce some order and draw up an objective map of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it should be stressed that, despite certain reservations, the Commission's accounts are reliable. Accordingly, save perhaps in a few specific areas, the figures provided by the budgetary accounts correspond to the actual use made of appropriations. This view is borne out by a rigorous professional auditing effort, in which the Court has invested considerable resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this effort has also led the Court to criticise the accounting system. The shortcomings that have been highlighted make it difficult to obtain the better-quality information that is necessary to improve management. I refer, for example, to the deficiencies in the system of accruals accounting when it comes to presenting the state of the Commission's assets and liabilities. For years the Court has been drawing attention to these defects, and at last its observations appear to have elicited some response. Today we are determinedly pressing the Commission to take remedial action. When we meet here again next year we will just as determinedly demand results, which I am confident will be positive. In the meantime, I would ask that the Commission be allowed to concentrate on this task, which is not at all easy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now deal with what I believe to be a crucial issue in the Report: the reform of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">2001 was a year of transition which was marked by significant progress, especially in the fields of financial management and internal control. Let us see what the Court's main observations in this respect are.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to point out that certain measures are not being introduced within the time limits stipulated. This delay is above all due to an overly ambitious initial timetable, as the Court has already complained. Secondly, the Council has adopted a new Financial Regulation which the Court considers generally appropriate. Despite some remaining unsatisfactory elements, this is a good instrument which will help to improve the administration of Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, the Directors-General have drafted activity reports and prepared declarations on the quality of information and internal control. Increasing top managers' accountability in this way is one of the keys to the reform's success. This is a genuine revolution in the Commission's management culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We recommend improving the approach to drawing up reports and declarations: presentation dates must be brought forward and guidelines must be issued in more precise terms, avoiding ambiguity, specifying possible observations and reservations and more clearly outlining plans of action. The Commission has summarised the reports and declarations by the Directors-General in a single document which it has submitted to Parliament and the Council. This summary includes a plan of action which aims to remedy the problems that have been identified. The plan should provide more detail on issues such as the monitoring of internal control standards and the reform of SINCOM.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one aspect of the reform deserves greater attention. I refer to the Member States' management of programmes under what is known as 'shared management'. The Commission is having problems with incorporating concrete measures aimed at checking and improving the effectiveness of these management systems, which account for more than 80% of the budget, into its overall strategy. Solutions urgently need to be found, but the Commission on its own is powerless: it needs the active collaboration of national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this message provides an appropriate conclusion to my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform is progressing positively. The Commission has met its commitment to work hard on improving its administrative and control practices. However, it will take more time to achieve the excellent and exemplary administration we all want to see. It is a laborious process to which all the institutions must contribute their experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year the Court will analyse the progress made, report on the deficiencies and recommend any measures it considers necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you very much for your attention.</p>

I wish to thank all the members and staff of the Court of Auditors for their good cooperation throughout the year and for the Court's recommendations, which are indispensable if the European Budget is to be put to good use and properly administered. With the Statement of Assurance specifically in mind, I am also grateful for their frankness about the methodology applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I will follow Mr Fabra Vallés in concentrating on three points, specifically the surplus from 2001, accounting, and Commission reform. The Court is critical of the EUR 15 billion surplus for that year on the grounds that it is not the result of savings – which would have been a good thing – but has come about because the Budget provision on which Parliament had decided had not been fully used, and because programmes, especially in structural policy, had simply got going more slowly than had been planned. The surplus represents the difference between the estimates and cash data as set out in the revenue and expenditure accounts, in line with the accountability required by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Why was there such a great discrepancy in structural expenditure? In this area, the Commission always relies on proposals and predictions by the Member States, and in this instance we were working on the basis of assumptions that were simply unrealistic. I told the ECOFIN meeting yesterday, and not for the first time, that there is still, in the Member States, no systematic procedure for estimating, on a sound basis, how much in the way of resources can actually be drawn on in a financial year. This is where the Member States need to work together with the Commission on improving forecasting, which may be helped by our now presenting the Member States' forecasts to the Parliamentary Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Financial Regulation requires that any surplus from a financial year be credited to the Member States as income for the following year. We have done this principally by way of two supplementary Budgets, an instrument that also featured in discussions on the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the accounting standards, the Court has, as in previous years, again observed that the annual accounts for the financial year 2001 gives a true and faithful picture of revenue and expenditure, and of the Community's financial position at the end of the year. The Court subjects the financial management including of course the cash position, to detailed scrutiny. It is, then, quite simply wrong to assert that the Commission's books and cash position have not been audited for ten years! The Court examines in detail the accounts and the standards by which they are kept. The Court has again expressed reservations about the balance sheet, and is calling for further changes to be made to the system.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the new Financial Regulation requires all the institutions, with effect from 2005, to have one single balance sheet relating to specific periods, a requirement that also applies to Parliament. Having gained the impression that there is confusion about this, let me follow the President of the Court of Auditors in making a basic observation to clarify matters. Public sector accounting is, by tradition, cash-based, in the sense that it involves the recording of revenue and expenditure over against the Budget estimates arrived at by the body legislating for the Budget. This system is therefore in line with accountability to the budgetary authority. In some Member States, financial management continues to be founded on this principle, and there is no truth in the claim that this type of cash accounting is inherently susceptible to fraud. This sort of information is not, however, sufficient for administrative measures aimed at efficiency, and that is, as it has been emphasising for years, what the Court of Auditors is concerned about, and it is also a matter for concern for the Commission. There is a close connection between the adoption of commercial standards in the public sector and the overall reform of administration within the Commission, and also in some Member States in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">It is these aspects that have such a great part to play in the Budget, and especially in the balance sheet, but the budget-spending centres must be able to get more information from the accounts. We have committed ourselves to continued development, which the Court has also expressly enjoined on us, including improvements to the underlying computer system. Our accounting system is computer-based and capable of performing to the highest standards; I might add, by the way, that the budget-spending centres in all the Directorates-General and in the representations are linked together in a system of which some Member States can only dream. This too has been the subject of false allegations to the effect that 4 000 officials were able to carry out transactions directly and, as it were, on their own authority. That too is untrue. They are obliged to feed everything into one single system, and the Budget Directorate-General then carries out the actual transactions. A number of steps have been taken to improve this. This year, we have also been concerned to introduce improvements in the area of security, specifically concerning access by system managers, which the Court of Auditors had drawn our attention to on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control has the important task of checking the financial statement, and, should you need help in this, it goes without saying that my staff are always at your service. Mr Elles, if your group has come to the decision that it should seek help from elsewhere, that is manifestly its own business. As far as the hearings of a suspended official are concerned, the Conference of Presidents had given this matter their attention, and, when the official raised a query, it was to that and also to the proceedings currently underway that her attention was drawn – nothing more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I would like to thank Mr Fabra Vallés again for observing that the Court of Auditors, on the basis of rigorous and professional audit work, has confirmed the reliability of the Commission's accounts. The Commission is currently finalising a detailed framework for further modernisation of the accounting system that will take on board the very suggestions and criticisms that the Court of Auditors has made, and I will be able to present this to Parliament in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the third area – that of the reforms – the measures taken by the Commission are many in number and far-reaching in their effects. You will be aware that, in the area of the Budget, activity-based budgeting is changing the way in which the Budget is drawn up. Another major change is the strategic planning using the Annual Policy Strategy within the Commission. The offices of the Internal Audit Service and the Central Financial Service have been set up in the same way<span class="italic">.</span> The most crucial aspect, though, is the decentralisation of responsibility and accountability, as described by the Directors-General in their report. This must show whether the objectives set out in the Budget have been achieved, and whether a declaration on the financial management can be given, stating that all the control measures had been set up and were up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">This too involves new structures, such as annual reporting for example. We did this for the first time in 2001, and the Court of Auditors is right to point out that the statements by the Directors-General still differ in too many respects for them to be able to serve as a basis for some sort of Single Audit Concept. This is an observation with which the Commission concurs, and that is why we will shortly be deciding on appropriate improvements, which we will authorise the Directors-General to carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one suggestion in the Court of Auditors' report that I particularly want to pick up on, one that will also be important in terms of the work done by the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is the suggestion that the annual reports by the Directors-General should include a specific position statement on which of the Court of Auditors' recommendations have already been put into effect and which of them still require action to be taken. This would reduce the number of possible criticisms; this is a very good, indeed essential proposal, and one that we shall adopt. It will make the Budget Commissioner's work easier, as also that of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity of congratulating the Court of Auditors on its twenty-five years of existence, and also, on behalf of the Commission, to again thank it very warmly for all the work it has done. I would also like to address a few words to the principal rapporteur, Mr Casaca. Work on the discharge procedure has already begun, and the questionnaire you have submitted is a comprehensive one. For its part, the Commission will do all it takes to give you satisfactory answers in due time, that is to say by 18 December. The questionnaire also makes clear, Mr Casaca – and you can tell the committee this from me – that the cooperation involved will, in my view, be not only thoroughly in-depth, but also very good.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Fabra Vallés, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my warm congratulations to the Court of Auditors on twenty-five years of its existence and on last week's celebrations, which were entirely worthy of the occasion. Today's discussion on the Court's annual report for 2001, which you, Mr Fabra Vallés, thankfully presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control as long ago as the beginning of November, makes it possible for us to examine the same key areas that have already been mentioned – notably the enormous Budget surplus of over EUR 15 billion, the significance of which is that 16% of the resources allocated were not able to be spent even after the 2000 financial year had come to an end with all of 14% of funds unused and left over. We are very much in favour of frugality, but not at the expense of objectives that have been decided on, unless the capacity for implementing them had been overestimated from the outset!</p>
<p class="contents">In Chapter I, the Court reiterates the call it made in the previous year for a supplementary and amending Budget to be presented in good time. The Commission's response to this may well be technically correct, but it is not the right one politically. There is still a great deal of work to be done here. What the Court has to say in Chapter 9 of the Statement of Assurance is most interesting, but, at the same time, gives rise to grave concern. Again, with the exception of a few areas, certification of the accounts is withheld. The question arises of whether the top notch on this yardstick will ever be reached. In terms of discharge, the really important things will be a series of items such as Commission reform, financial management and the new Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The reliability of the Commission's accounting system has been the subject of vigorous debate, which the media have broadcast far and wide. The Committee on Budgetary Control was prevented from hearing the arguments of the Commission's accounting officer, who has since been suspended. What we now read in the Court's report– on pages 308 ff. for example – paints a pretty grim picture of deficits that have been present in the Commission's book-keeping and accounting procedures for years. Putting together the Court's criticisms in its reports from 1994 onwards, the result is proof of the culpably negligent way in which the Commission goes about remedying these serious defects. According to its current plans, the Commission intends to progressively remove them, but it will be 2005 by the time it will have done it, so the Court of Auditors and Parliament will have many years more checking up to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with two questions. The first is whether 2001 saw an improvement in Budget implementation. It is the discharge resolution that will provide the answer to that. The second is this: under the Treaty, it is the Commission that is responsible for the management of the Budget as a whole. The new Financial Regulation gives its Directorates-General decentralised responsibility. Who, though, in the Commission, is responsible for the monitoring of the whole within the Commission itself? The individual Directors-General, the Budget Directorate-General, or the accounting officer? In any case, it is, above all, you, Commissioner Schreyer, in your role as Budget Commissioner, to whom we shall continue to address our questions.</p>

So let me express my gratitude for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say something about the points that have already featured in numerous comments, such as, for example, the issue of the accounting system. Over the coming months, we Social Democrats will need to make the Court of Auditors' observations the foundation of the work we do, and, on that point, I have complete confidence in our rapporteur, Mr Paulo Casaca, who will not release the Commission from its obligation of providing information. There is though, one thing that I want to have put on the record, and that is the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control attached conditions to the invitation to the accounting officer to whom a number of references have been made. She was to provide additional evidence of the things that the Court of Auditors' comments had in any case already denounced. We then learned from an article in a newspaper published here in Brussels, that she was not willing to do so. This is also part of the story and should not be concealed.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted down what Mr Fabra Vallés said, in very diplomatic language, about the other point – that there was a lack of rigour and objectivity. Let me say it in my own words: we Social Democrats – like the other groups – have refused to let this House and its procedures degenerate into a circus of personalities, and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of course we do not include in that the Commission's expressions of delight at the state of the accounting system. The comments made by the Court of Auditors indeed give every cause for concern, and this is not, indeed, a matter in which we will be handing out credit points. We will pursue this matter, and the Commission will have to give an answer as to why, for certain periods of time, practically nothing was done to take into consideration the comments made by the Court of Auditors. We will not let them get away with telling us that this could not be done, because work had to be done on the new Financial Regulation. The two things have nothing to do with each other, and we expect prompt and clear information enabling us to follow up the reasons why certain things did not happen. If these explanations prove to be less than satisfactory, things are going to get unpleasant for everyone involved. That, I can promise you, is when things will turn ugly!</p>

I should like to start on a positive note. The Court of Auditors is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary, for which congratulations are in order, and I can only say that in those twenty-five years, the Court of Auditors has become a father figure without which this Parliament would be unable to do its job.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Court of Auditors notes that the Commission is functioning ever more effectively. The Court of Auditors takes a positive view of Commission reform, and the same more or less goes for the new Financial Regulation. This is the good news.</p>
<p class="contents">The bad news is that a positive Statement of Assurance has not yet been issued this year either. I should like to repeat what I said last year and the year before. Why can the Commission not be more specific and set a date by which we must have a positive Statement of Assurance? It would be something we could all work towards and we would know what to expect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also disappointing to perceive no real improvement in European unification’s oldest policy area, namely that of agricultural policy. Once again, the Court of Auditors is assessing agricultural spending very critically, and there appears to me to be hardly any tangible improvement. This is why I took the initiative earlier this year to better control agricultural spending. This topic will be discussed shortly in this House, and I hope that the Commission, the Council, as well as the MEPs will assess it in a positive light.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also this year for the first time that the Directors-General of the Commission will be required to account for healthy financial management. I think that this will be essential in the future. As far as the procedure is concerned, surely there is room for at least some improvement, and the reports will also need to be more specific and clearer, but I think that this will be also an essential point for us as Parliament in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As everything that needed to be said about the surplus on the budget has already been said, I will not enter into any great detail on this subject. Suffice to say that we naturally need to budget more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about the Statement of Assurance itself. This is the same message I am having to repeat. I gather from the Court of Auditors and the Commission that it is very difficult to indicate margins of error in some sections of the Budget, but I would still appreciate it if the Court of Auditors were to develop certain indicators where possible. We should be able to judge, from one year to the next, whether things have generally improved by a certain percentage. Everyone likes to know the final score, and this should also be possible for the European Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">One major point that is left is enlargement. The Court of Auditors itself admits that even the current Member States leave a great deal to be desired on this score. As far as I am aware, the IACS (integrated administration and control system) has not yet become operational in any of the new Member States. This is a point of grave concern and something which will require attention particularly in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As previously, there are very concrete cases in a number of areas where EU funds are being used entirely wrongly, especially within agricultural policy. The report also points to the enormous surplus of EUR 15 billion, in other words 16% of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, the most serious point in this annual report is, however, the general criticism of the reliability of the EU’s accounting system and of its financial management. This criticism was very clear both in the report and during its presentation to the committee. At the presentation, the representatives of the Court of Auditors told the committee that, because the system works the way it does, it can in fact only be guaranteed that 5% of the payments are correct. This in itself is unprecedented and something that must be taken incredibly seriously. In addition, the changes seem to be taking a long time. The Court of Auditors’ report states that, in May this year, the action plan which is to lead to improvements had not even begun to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this serious criticism of the accounting system, the statement of assurance nevertheless states that the transactions have been carried out correctly. In my view, this is highly contradictory. In principle, it is impossible to claim both these things at the same time. One cannot both point to an accounting system which cannot be followed and be able to guarantee that everything has been managed correctly. I question whether this statement of assurance is actually justified.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know about the vehement criticism of the accounts from former chief accountant Mrs Marta Andreasen. She also refused to sign off the accounts for 2001. I would like to ask the Court of Auditors whether they understand this, considering the criticism that the Court of Auditors itself has put forward. Is it not the case that not signing off the accounts is quite a reasonable position to adopt?</p>
<p class="contents">Another interesting view from Mrs Marta Andreasen is that fast improvements can be implemented without new investment in the Commission. It would be interesting to hear the opinion of the Court of Auditors on this matter too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also a little surprised about this debate where the criticism made by Mrs Andreasen is being dismissed. It <span class="italic">may </span>be the case that it is incorrect but, if this is the case, why may we not hear this criticism? Why do the other political groups here in the European Parliament not want a <span class="italic">hearing</span>? Why is the Commission in practice gagging Mrs Andreasen when members of the European Parliament have invited her in to make our audit work easier? It is not a particularly attractive development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could be asking my fellow MEPs a whole string of questions today. I could question the considerable budget surplus of EUR 15 million; I could ask why, for the umpteenth year in a row, no positive Statement of Assurance has been issued; I could ask about the Commission's accounting system, about the shortcomings of the Member States which, all in all, already manage 80% of European subsidy policy; about pre-accession policy, or about Sapard, where only 9.2% of the resources have been used. These are all important questions, which we will be addressing together with the rapporteur, Mr Casaca, over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is only one important question left today. Members of the Court of Auditors, you know that I am on good terms with the Court. I like working with you and we work well together. However, according to OLAF's annual report, allegations have been made by an MEP to OLAF with regard to possible misappropriations by a former member of the Court of Auditors. You will be aware that I am that MEP.</p>
<p class="contents">When I heard about those allegations, I passed them on to OLAF. I specifically did not want any publicity at the time. I wanted to see whether OLAF would do its job, and I have to compliment the OLAF investigators on doing a sterling job. A few weeks ago, they submitted a dossier to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. They also submitted a dossier to the Court of Auditors itself with a number of recommendations. One of those recommendations was to mount a disciplinary inquiry against a former member of the Court of Auditors and against someone who used to be one of its temporary officials. I understand that a request has also been made for a financial reimbursement to the tune of EUR 28 000. Members of the Court of Auditors, I should like to ask you for your official reaction to the OLAF inquiry. Will you be taking on board the recommendations that the Court of Auditors has made? Can you also give me permission to examine this OLAF dossier myself? Thirdly, can you assure me that the case involving Mrs N is an isolated one and that it is not common practice within the Court of Auditors?</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Court of Auditors, it is a crucial question because we will shortly be debating not only Parliament's discharge, the Commission's discharge, but also, among other things, the discharge of the Court of Auditors itself. I think that an honest and open answer from you is very important in terms of the Committee on Budgetary Control’s, or Parliament's, ability to decide whether or not to grant you discharge with respect to the year 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What would happen if it was ultimately concluded that no declaration could be made as to whether the construction work, purchases or services forming the basis of the payments to the local recipients, actually took place? If all this happened, the board of directors would, firstly, refuse to give discharge to the management. It would then get rid of the management. After that, the taxation authorities would turn up and seize all the business’s accounts documentation for critical analysis. Afterwards, the business would have its taxes raised to the tune of the undocumented expenditure, and finally there would be talk of criminal liability.</p>
<p class="contents">But not so in the EU. This is just the approach we take for private business. Here, the Commission seeks to silence criticism by all possible means, which is exactly what happened with the sacked accounts director Mrs Marta Andreasen, and when Parliament wished to make thorough enquiries into her criticism, a majority in the Conference of Presidents prevented us from holding a hearing. If the criticism was unjustified, as the Commission claims, we would of course clear this up, and all would be well. However, the Commission knows, and the European Court of Auditors has confirmed, that the criticism is justified, and therefore it must not come to light. Instead, this Parliament chooses to turn a blind eye; which means giving discharge, as otherwise the citizens could find out that the EU finances are not under control. I think that it is incredibly unwise to continue with this hush-hush policy, and I do not believe that it is possible in the long run to avoid the scandal that is the EU’s failure to manage the money the taxpayers are handing over to us. I find the report very enlightening. The problem is that we do not dare to back our criticism up with action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that the Commission hardly takes any notice of the criticisms and recommendations contained in this annual report. Is this really going to change this year? We fear the worst. This Commission has been promising a change for the better since 1999, but the fact that by May 2002, no real action had been taken to reform the accounting system is, according to the EDD Group, an absolute mockery. The Commission is asking for a repeat of the fall in 1999, particularly in the light of the fact that Mrs Andreasen was not allowed to give us any information about the shortcomings in the accounting and the administrative organisation this morning. This being the case, we would ask the President of the Court of Auditors whether he would be able to submit a special report containing all the relevant information on this topic by mid-March 2003. We are tired of the Commission's delaying tactics and of its beating about the bush. Is the President of the Court of Auditors of the opinion that a more independent position in respect of the Commission could considerably enhance the effectiveness of his institution?</p>
<p class="contents">Given the virtually built-in surplus in the Structural Fund policy, this is due for a thorough overhaul, also in view of the EU's impending enlargement. In addition to better control, an integral policy evaluation is needed as a matter of urgency. Can the Court of Auditors indicate whether the unaltered course of the present Structural Fund policy after 2004 will lead to even greater administrative problems? In our view, we should, as soon as possible, put a stop to the pumping around of government funding, which entails the considerable risk of it being taken advantage of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes it very clear to us that the Commission’s accounts are reliable, and also that, despite the criticism that can be made of the accounting system, this system is not necessarily the root cause of fraud. These are two things that I feel are important in the context of the debate that we are holding.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, it goes without saying, Mr President, but above all, Commissioner, that this House is concerned by the Commission’s accounting situation, and I must honestly say – even I who, as you know, always adopt a cautious attitude in the light of ‘scandals’ – that some decisions, such as the one taken this morning, do not, in my view, help the Commission to show that it can propose a legitimate reform of the accounting system and do this in good faith. I sometimes tell myself that ‘we are learning nothing’ or as the Latin saying goes <span class="italic">'oportet ut scandala eveniat!'</span>. Why have we resorted to using a scandal, a mini-scandal, a mini-debate in order to delay a reform – reform which you yourselves have admitted is urgent – for such a long time?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the question that is essentially being raised. We look forward to your forthcoming decision. I believe, however, and the Court of Auditors says this, that this has nothing to do with the discovery of cases of fraud or poor management by the Commission, but I feel, in fact, that it is high time that this reform got off the ground, is discussed, and that it is carried out in all the institutions. It is a shame that it is caused by a situation that we have recently experienced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a rigorous, clear and very focused report, which provides us with precise information on how the budget has been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The most striking aspect of this report is, once again, the significant budgetary surplus for 2001: 16%. It is a very high percentage, as the previous speakers have been repeating, especially if we analyse it in detail and realise that, of the Structural Funds, just 70% has been implemented and that the SAPARD budget has barely been implemented at all, despite the fact that it is an enormously important instrument for the new countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A similar thing is also happening in the case of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reliability of the accounts that the Commission has presented, the Court’s report considers them to be adequate and, amongst the recommendations it makes, I would like to stress the one relating to the accounting system. As in previous years, the Court believes that actions should be taken to modify the current system in order to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">And given that this issue has led to some controversy – excessive controversy in my opinion – it would be desirable for the Commission to take very good account of the recommendations for modernisation of the accounting system and to make it as transparent as possible as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is also necessary to point out the reference to the internal reform of the Commission and the slowness with which it is taking place. This is no doubt due to the fact that it is a complicated and ambitious process, but we should also remember that it is a necessary reform, and we therefore hope that the Commission will take very good account of the recommendations made to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to elaborate on the previous speeches. Practically all the Members who are speaking agree on the concerns in this report and the clarity with which they have been presented and I therefore believe that the ball is in the Commission’s court.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Fabra Vallés once again. There is absolutely no doubt that his experience as a former member of the Committee on Budgetary Control has been a great help to him in carrying out his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her kind words to me and I wish to offer her my particular thanks for the cooperation I have received from the Commission services in this discharge process.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework of budgetary implementation in 2001 outlined by this report is characterised by a very strong implementation of the budget, which in particular affects appropriations for the pre-accession and Structural Fund programmes, due to ongoing shortcomings in Community accounting procedures, which need to be reformed as a matter of urgency, and also due to the persistence of long-standing problems, such as the lack of transparency in the Commission’s handling of the system of protection for the European sugar industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the shortcomings of the budgetary implementation it is particularly shocking to see that the stated concern at the lack of preparation of the candidate countries appears to have varied in a way that is inversely proportional to the Funds that have actually been made available to the final beneficiaries, especially to the farmers of these countries. It sometimes appears that the myriad consulting companies that hover around the European institutions, often composed of former officials or of officials on temporary leave, are more important than the citizens. The rules are also taking on an absurd and increasing complexity, which is out of step with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In the much needed revision of the accounting system everything – and I mean ‘everything’ – that is considered necessary to ensure that the EU’s accounting systems adhere to international best practices and public accounting standards must be done. The modernisation of accounting and payment procedures, with clear, accessible and exhaustive codification of all expenditure, with the systematic notification of final beneficiaries and with clear and consistent terminology, are projects that we would like to see implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The transparency of relations between the European institutions and the outside world is a recurring concern. The Court’s account of the case that led to the sugar system not being reformed demonstrates how one of the most anachronistic farming systems in the Community has been able to hold out for almost four decades without making any significant changes. In a complex high level intermediation system it is sometimes easy to forget the citizens in favour of the pressure groups, overlooking those in greatest need in favour of those who are able to exert the most and the most effective pressure. It is therefore crucial to make the fight for transparency and fairness part of our daily work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Court of Auditors confirms in no uncertain terms that many of the recurrent problems surrounding the underlying transactions, which are making it impossible to issue a statement of assurance without reservation, are due to the flawed accounting system. The Commission acknowledges most of the defects that the Court of Auditors points out. It never ceases to amaze me, however, that the Commission did not take action back in 2001, on the basis of the draft action plan which was submitted in that very year with a view to responding to some of the most pressing problems. I am now looking forward to a frank and serious discussion between the Commission and Parliament, so that we can finally get this cleared up. It is politically untenable that auditors’ criticisms keep on coming. If something is wrong, it <span class="italic">must</span> be put right.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has promised that its strategy for giving the EU an integrated accounting system based on the highest standards within the public sector will be presented at the end of this month. I wish to hold the Commission to this promise, and I welcome the action plan. I also hope, however, that the plan will get straight down to addressing the areas requiring immediate action, especially given that the Committee on Budgetary Control is to focus on just this accounting system in connection with the discharge for 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a very interesting spin on the words you have actually written within your report. You mention in your statement a lack of balance in what is being said in the public arena at the moment and I agree with this. I would have liked to equal that balance out from the 300 Commission spin-doctors that have been saying things about Marta Andreassen recently and point Members of Parliament's attention to the fact that she was gagged by that very same Commission this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">But what did you write? You wrote: 'Since the first statement of assurance in respect to the financial year 1994, the Court has repeated its reservations in respect to the reliability of the accounts. These reservations most often have their roots in the weakness of the accounting system and in the low awareness of the Commission's operational DGs etc.'. You also said: 'In the absence of a comprehensive accounting system, the year-end financial statements are drawn up largely on the basis of records which are not part of the accounts. I would say these are actually two quite shocking statements and, oddly enough, I would also say they back up exactly some of the things that Marta Andreassen, the Commission's former chief accountant, had been saying.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as you just said in your statement, the accounts are so reliable, then why write those things in your report? If the accounts are so good, why did so many heads of departments refuse to sign their own accounts off without reservations? If your checks are so thorough, why do you not give us, the Parliament, a figure that we have requested for many years now, which is the percentage of money lost through fraud, mismanagement and waste – a figure you used to give us to allow us to have a benchmark to see if things are materially getting better.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have one or two questions for the Commissioner because I am quite sure that you are a wise political manoeuvrer, Commissioner Schreyer. I think you have probably heard a host of political speeches in this Parliament today about the Court of Auditors' reports and how people are framing themselves, looking forward to discharge. I believe you have a whole host of problems coming forward and, should you read the political tea-leaves correctly, you will be keen to get your reforms under way even quicker than you have done.</p>
<p class="contents">So please, with that sort of political nous that you have, could you just answer a handful of very short questions for me? Who did sign off within the Commission the accounts in 2001? I think I have tabled this question to you and also a whole host of journalists have asked you this. We would really like that answer. Was it the Chief Accountant at the time? Was it the Director-General of Budgets? Was it you? Was it some secretary? Was it the commercial engineer you have employed as the Chief Accountant of the Commission presently? What is going on within your systems?</p>
<p class="contents">We want reform. This Parliament urges you to reform, and if you do not quickly reform the system, then please leave and let someone who will do the job do it properly.</p>

I am extremely disappointed that this is the first occasion on which the Court has been able to present its audit this year. I think it is one of the primary responsibilities of this Parliament and I am very saddened that it has taken it until December to put on the agenda something that came out in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the report has been set out has improved a little bit; however, I think the document itself is still largely impenetrable. It is over-complicated and is badly presented. We hope, President, that you will continue in your efforts to make this clearer in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issue on which the Budget Control Committee is likely to concentrate this year is of course the accounting system of the Commission. This is not because Marta Andreassen has told us that we should do that, but because the Court has been pointing out these failures since 1994. The fact is that the Commission has been extremely slow in instigating those reforms and we still are unlikely to see a complete radical reform until 2005. I think this is an unacceptable degree of complacency. We must go much further and set a more ambitious timetable. Although we do recognise, and in fact what we are asking the Commission to do here is already ahead of 11 EU Member States in their presentation of their accounts. But we are being tough on you and we want to push you to meet the standards of the best.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court has also been remiss in the fact that they have failed again to name and shame Member States who have failed to control EU spending and I do not think we are ever going to identify the real culprits until the Court of Auditors stops being quite so cowardly and starts naming people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting, as people have said before, that this is the first year when Directors General have taken control of their own departments but 22 of those DGs have expressed reservations and we will be investigating those during our research.</p>
<p class="contents">An issue that many are keen to follow is also the failure of the Commission to fine Member States who infringe EU directives and I would just like to warn the Commission that we are going to take this issue a lot more seriously. We want to see more money coming into EU coffers from the fines that should be imposed on Members States who fail to respect directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a series of specific questions and general comments, but to stay somewhat in line with the agenda, I believe it was Mr Kuhne who said that he had confidence in Mr Casaca. As far as I am concerned, naturally, as far as I know, that confidence is complete and absolute. But not only confidence in him, but in the whole House, in all the Members, but I am aware of the usual good work of Mr Casaca.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, issues relating to the DAS have been mentioned. We are often asked when we will be able to provide a positive DAS. Well, I am convinced that the day that the internal control of the Commission – which has just begun – is working properly, will be the day when the DAS is positive. Because I am sure that it will be the Commission that rectifies and controls itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we not give the error rate? I have said several times, whenever I am asked, that the error rate provides limited information and may lead to distorted interpretations. I therefore believe it is better not to provide this information.</p>
<p class="contents">We are then told that we could provide the DAS by sector. If only! And I say ‘if only’ because if we had the resources to carry out a DAS by sector, you may rest assured that we would do so. And you may be sure that we would derive much more information.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that today, with the information provided by the DAS, something very clear has to be taken into account: to speak of mistakes does not always mean speaking of irregularities, and speaking of irregularities does not always mean speaking of fraud. Therefore, what the error rate indicates are errors and what we have to look at is the background to these errors. This error rate, because of the sampling system employed, is so small, that what we cannot do is give it to Parliament so that it can interpret it as if it were a clear result, which indicates exactly what people want to hear. That is the reason.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working on a new methodology for the DAS and we hope that with that new methodology we will be able to reach a point where we can provide the information required by Parliament and that that will be sufficient for the needs of our budgetary authority, both the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Staes asked me a question about the case of Mrs N. All I can say about this is that, from the moment OLAF arrived at the Court of Auditors, all doors were left open to them, the cupboards unlocked and the computers switched on so that they could look at whatever they want.</p>
<p class="contents">When you ask whether we have already taken measures, I believe that the Court of Auditors has adopted a prudent attitude, waiting for the Solicitor-General to assess the documentation provided by OLAF, because member N has yet to be heard. I believe that we, as the Court of Auditors, cannot pass judgment, because although we are called a court, we do not pass judgment, we only make recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe it is prudent to wait for the Solicitor-General in Luxembourg to assess the documentation provided to him by OLAF. But it should be noted that at this very moment there is a group of members of the Court working on this issue. What for? To get as much as possible done before the Solicitor-General gives his opinion, whatever that opinion may be and whatever assessment he sees fit to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dell'Alba said that he is worried. I believe we should all be worried. And we should all be because whether the Commission improves or not depends on all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the honourable Members fulfil their duties, and I know because I used to be a Member of this House, and I remember how I used to enjoy getting stuck in. But I must say that I have found a completely different situation. It is not that I have passed over to the enemy or changed sides, nor have I moved over from Barcelona to Real Madrid, no; I have genuinely found a Commission which is different to the one I was accustomed to dealing with. A Commission in which I see daily changes. You say these changes cannot yet be seen in the final result? It is true, they cannot. And do you know why? Because this is not simply a face-lift. If it were simply a face-lift, a nip and a tuck, and the results would be visible very soon. The Commission is undergoing a profound change. And therefore until next year I am sure we will not see any changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that confidence, and as well as confidence, help, should be offered by all of us, and we must not forget – you are in contact with the governments, with the States, and you must pass this on also to the governments – that one of the current problems the Commission has in terms of improving its results, the Community budget for improving its results, is also in the hands of the governments. Therefore, I believe that if all the institutions as well as the governments make an effort, we will help the Commission to achieve tangible results as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Heaton-Harris that I am sorry but I am not going to reply in relation to the former chief accountant because a disciplinary procedure is under way and I am not therefore going to answer. What I can say, and we should all agree on this, is that I believe there has been a mistake in the procedure; there has been a procedural error.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would say to Mrs Morgan that of course we are making an effort. You ask us to make an effort; we really do make an effort every day, everyday we increase contacts and dialogue with the various institutions in order to improve our work. We hope that this work will be increasingly useful to you. I am prepared to commit myself to this, of course. I believed that the approach of the report had managed to improve something, because all I have done is seek something I would have asked for and present it as a consequence. It seems that it is not yet sufficient, but I promise, Mrs Morgan, that next year we will make a further effort.</p>

Neither have I received a reply to the question whether the case involving Mrs N, the former member of the Court of Auditors, is an isolated one and whether we can rely on this not being common practice within the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should say that I am extremely dissatisfied with his response. In its press release, OLAF first says the following about this case: ‘we have submitted a dossier to the judicial authorities in Luxembourg’. OLAF subsequently adds: ‘in this context OLAF has recommended to the European Court of Auditors to open a disciplinary inquiry into these persons and to initiate recovery procedures in respect of the sums in question’. I now hear that the Court of Auditors is waiting for the judicial inquiry in Luxembourg. I fear that this will take years and years, as is customary in Belgian courts. I should still urge the Court of Auditors to do as OLAF has recommended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, in its report, OLAF makes it clear – and I will give you a small piece of information from the report – that the case of member ‘N’ is – and I quote – 'a specific case and the procedures used by the Court of Auditors for internal control are correct'. That is all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
