<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, there is no guarantee that the forthcoming revision of the Treaties at the IGC will clear the way for a revision of the Community’s judicial systems. The idea of including this issue on the agenda we are discussing today was still on the agenda of the Helsinki Summit, is still being advocated by various Member States and by the courts themselves, and is being kept alive in the European Parliament, whose Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is preparing what I think will be a high-quality opinion on the nature and the extent of judicial reform.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that Parliament’s next report on preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference will address this issue rigorously, for three reasons which are, to my mind, interlinked. These are that justice must be done more quickly, that we need to establish the legal bases for an area of freedom, security and justice, and, finally, that we need to move beyond a commercial and economic conception of Europe. This will convince the public that they are part of a legal community which is based on democratic law and on the courts, and which respects their fundamental ethical and legal values and protects their interests, even when the force of national law is not sufficient to guarantee them full citizenship. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that these fundamental reasons for a thorough reform of the entire Community judicial system also explain the possible reform of the Court of First Instance which we are discussing today, although that has a different legal basis, namely the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">These reasons do, however, justify such a reform, particularly two or three of them, which I shall now mention. The first is the imbalance between the increasing volume of cases, the technical and human capacity of the courts in Luxembourg and the strict obligation to adhere to multilingual proceedings, which is the natural consequence of respect for each country’s language and legal traditions. The last reason is that this court, the Court of First Instance, is the only instance to which individuals and companies have recourse on economic disputes with regard to decisions by the bodies which affect them. Therefore, the proposed increase to 21 judges is fully justified because, ultimately, it is a matter of increasing the Court’s efficiency and it will enable two additional chambers to be established, in each of which three judges will sit.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The second reform proposed concerns an increase in the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, which, at present, only covers actions for annulment by private individuals but which will then also cover actions brought by Member States. I am talking here about potential actions by the Member States concerning transport policy, competition rules applicable to undertakings, state aids, trade protection measures, the application of funds, and other action programmes under which the Community grants financial assistance, particularly concerning proceedings relating to fraud against the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">When Member States accept the possibility of an appeal to the Court of First Instance involving proceedings on the same matter as an action already brought by a private individual, the Court will be able to establish what appeals a Member State has lodged. This will put Member States and private individuals on an equal footing in the way the Court functions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, some people will call this a lightweight reform, but the fact is that it is an achievable reform, based on standards which make it permissible under the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is basically the reform envisaged and requested by the Court of the European Communities itself independently of the IGC and on the basis of the Treaty currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe, particularly because there was such considerable consensus within the committee, that Parliament will agree to these two proposals and that it will give the Court its vote. We can only hope that the Council will do the same. My last hope is that the Court will make the best possible use of its new powers, the new jurisdiction which this Parliament has, not a moment too soon, decided to grant it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency’s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts. For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon. Today – and I must say this with pride and satisfaction – this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests. Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system. However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.</p>
<p class="contents">The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information. For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed. It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment – as he himself has pointed out – we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference. We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament’s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth. These are two of Vice-President Marinho’s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more <span class="italic">référendaire</span>. The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated. At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated. According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points. The first concerns this Parliament. I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges. Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources. We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens. And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency. Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT. The decision could have huge implications for our local economy. Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age. These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe’s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court. Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references. This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court’s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning. In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system. Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service. In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here. For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage – I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law. I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission’s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level. It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions. We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind. Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper – and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament – for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law. As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases. It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court. The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance. That would be another way of spurring the reform process on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union is a system based on law. It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law. Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied. The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges. There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order – hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system. The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union’s disputes resolution procedures. This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government. Certainly it is perceived <span class="italic">de facto</span> to be impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening in France, Mr President, appears <span class="italic">prima facie</span> to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance. May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas. The unease is justified. It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied. The Commission sympathises with these considerations. In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows. </p>
<p class="contents">As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk – in the short term – of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines. Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned. In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
