<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that Colombia matters to us, being a country in which a number of the European Union’s interests are involved, ranging from trade and investment to such issues as the production of and trade in drugs, criminal networks, terrorism, migratory flows and the regional dimension of the conflict that is going on there. More than anything else, though, values that we share with our Colombian friends are involved, such as respect for human rights, the rule of law and also the alleviation of poverty and sustainable economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">So I thank you for affording me the opportunity to set out my assessment of the situation in Colombia and the policies that we want to adopt with respect to it. I will be discussing the strategic objective of our actions and the fundamental principles and instruments that underpin them, which we are applying with this objective in mind. The ongoing grave violations of human rights and the fact that the security situation is still very difficult for many Colombians naturally cause us grave disquiet and demand our full solidarity, above all with the Colombian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our strategic objective is, then, the achievement of lasting peace and support for the Colombians to that end. Our strategy as a whole with regard to Colombia has the quest for a peaceful solution as its cornerstone. To this conflict there will be no purely military solution, and so it is important that we seek ways of coming to peaceful agreement even with illegally armed groupings, provided that they are willing to enter into real negotiations towards a peace treaty. In this light, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, particularly in regard to his dealings with the illegal armed groups in Colombia. The current involvement of the Organisation of American States in the ‘Mission of support for the peace process in Colombia’<span class="italic"> </span>and the Mexican Government’s mediation between the Colombian Government and the <span class="italic">Ejercito de la Liberación nacional </span>both represent very valuable contributions. All the illegal armed groups must put an end to hostilities; they have also been required to demonstrate their willingness to at last embark on the peace process by immediately and unconditionally releasing all hostages and all other persons held by them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union must consider how we can provide funding to support the peace negotiations as soon as a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the armed groups is in place. We are convinced that Colombia’s vibrant civil society, too, plays a vital part in these peace negotiations by engaging in ongoing dialogue with the Colombian Government and with the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim in the shorter term is to secure compliance with the undertakings given at the 2003 London Conference by the international community and the Colombian Government. While we must hold to our commitments as regards financial aid, the Colombian Government must also abide by those it has made, particularly those relating to respect for human rights, which it made to the United Nations High Commissioner responsible for these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting called by the Colombian Government for 3 and 4 February 2005 will present a very good opportunity both to reiterate the international community’s solidarity with the Colombian people and to issue a reminder regarding the undertakings that have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Our strategy with regard to Colombia is based, then, on three fundamental principles: firstly the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which goes hand in hand with monitoring of the human rights situation. The second is that of good governance, which involves our giving support to the Colombian Government, particularly in its efforts to build up the rule of law. Thirdly, of course, there is sustainable development, especially the development of social cohesion, which was also discussed at the May summit in Guadalajara.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the Commission are deploying all the foreign policy instruments available to them in order to achieve these objectives. One of these is that of active diplomacy, whereby we support the international peace process. Another important instrument is the extremely favourable trade arrangements for Colombian exports, by which I mean the proposal we have put forward for the General System of Preferences, which will enable trade preferences for Colombia’s exports to be maintained, and which also of course benefits sustainable economic development. The third instrument is development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration of Community aid as such, whereby the EU Member States provide bilateral aid, reveals that the Commission really has discharged its obligations. I believe we can take pride in having in fact done more than we undertook to do. At the end of the current programming period, we will be able to go further, and, at the 2001 donors’ conference, we announced EUR 140 million for Colombia for the 2001 – 2006 period, the largest sum that we spend on any one country in Latin America. By the end of 2003 we had already committed EUR 136 million, and I am persuaded that we will, between 2004 and 2006, have allocated all these amounts, which are in fact substantially in excess of what had been promised.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of priorities that we seek to achieve by means of this Community aid, which is administered by Colombia itself. One is the strengthening of institutions, especially in the justice system and where the rule of law is concerned;<span class="italic"> </span>this is very important. Secondly, we seek to support the peace process through what are termed ‘peace laboratories’, which are comprehensive programmes for integrated local development, intended primarily to complement peace initiatives at the local level. Finally, as I have already said, we seek to defend human rights and provide humanitarian aid, particularly for the victims of expulsions. It is thanks to the reforms to the administration of Community aid set in motion by my predecessor Chris Patten that net payments have increased to an enormous degree, reaching almost EUR 30 million as early as 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I have attempted to set out what underlies a good policy for Colombia. I believe that we must continue down this road, and you can rely on the Commission to do so in future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These recommendations are often addressed not just to the Colombian Government, but also to the armed parties, such as the paramilitaries, the FARC and the ELN; organisations which appear on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact the FARC who have been responsible for more than 6 000 kidnaps and more than 300 murders over recent years and also for anti-personnel mines, which regrettably kill an average of two people every day in Colombia, of which 40% are civilians; and of that 40%, half are children.</p>
<p class="contents">President Uribe has implemented a democratic security policy which has promoted a whole series of improvements. Over recent years, there has been a 26% reduction in kidnaps, and the murder rate is the lowest for 18 years, but very many mayors are being threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that President Uribe has been one of the few Heads of State to come to this Parliament, to appear in plenary and who, furthermore, has appeared before the committee in order hold a frank dialogue with Members on the human rights situation in his country. This dialogue has been continued by the Vice-President, who comes every year to speak with non-governmental organisations and to inform them of the progress being made by the Government in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to say that only through ignorance and bad faith could we fail to recognise the progress made over recent years as a result of the Colombian Government’s policy. It is clear that our Parliament must support the cause of human rights, that the Government can and must do more, but it is also clear that the perpetrators of extortion, of murder, of blackmail and those who are producing the victims are the terrorist organisations – the FARC and the ELN – and we must be relentless in our pursuit of these organisations, who are the real perpetrators of wilful violations of human rights in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament had an excellent relationship with Mrs Ferrero-Waldner when she was President-in-Office of the Council, and I am sure that will be maintained over the next five years. I am also very impressed with her presentation of the situation in Colombia. Colombia is probably one of the most visually stunning countries in the whole world, a beautiful country with fantastic wealth and wonderful people who are friendly and charming.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Colombia does have a problem: institutionalised violence. The street violence and the confrontations between the guerrillas and drug-traffickers are symptomatic of an incredibly unjust system and of the massive inequalities in the country. Consequently, even if we put an end to guerrilla activities and drug-trafficking, violence would still re-emerge unless we resolve these problems. I believe that the Commissioner has given us a clear, objective, detailed and very constructive approach. It is not a case of addressing just one of the problems. Clearly there can be no peace if the violence continues, but equally there can be no peace unless we solve the underlying problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commissioner has indicated the best path to follow, since it addresses all elements: human rights, security, development and, above all, social progress. Any government policy would need to include all these elements, and the Commission and European Union as a whole should enable the Colombian authorities and any other influential organisation to help the country move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Unquestionably, terrorist and guerrilla organisations have committed acts of terrorism, but let us not forget that many left-wing trade union leaders in Colombia have been assassinated by paramilitary organisations. Often we do not know whether these organisations are linked to the government. I therefore feel that the Commissioner’s approach is the right one, and we should work to implement that approach so as to assist the Colombian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The previous legislature had criticised what was known as the ‘Colombia Plan’ and had proposed far-reaching social reforms. The Commission, the Council and Parliament had declared themselves ready to play the role of facilitators in the negotiations, initiated by President Pastrana, between the government and the guerrillas. The obstacles faced by this declaration were, firstly, the abandonment of this policy by the Colombian authorities and, secondly, the FARC’s scandalous practice of taking hostages, illustrated by the case of Ingrid Betancourt. The field has therefore been abandoned to the extremists on both sides: on the one hand, the FARC and, on the other hand, President Uribe’s administration which, by proposing to put civilians into uniform and to accord immunity and funding to the paramilitaries, has dangerously jeopardised the constitutional state.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is to be done? There is only one solution left to us: to support civil society’s efforts to promote peace, as expressed for example through the Civil Society Permanent Assembly for Peace. Let us remember that this form of coordination had resulted in the collection of ten million signatures for peace. The Assembly now proposes a broad humanitarian agreement involving, for example, exchanges of prisoners but, above all, respect by the two sides for international humanitarian law. From this point of view, I approve the statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. We call upon the Colombian Government to respect the constitutional state and humanitarian law. We expect the guerrillas to release the hostages as a sign of their desire to return to the negotiating table. We shall fund the peace laboratories and the support for civil society in Colombia. The best way in which Europe can help promote peace in Colombia is to support initiatives of this type and the local authorities in Colombia that follow these up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first issue, as far as Colombia is concerned, is the policy begun by President Uribe. Only a few months ago, a respected US weekly, <span class="italic">Newsweek</span>, put a photograph of the Colombian president on its cover and claimed that when President Alvaro Uribe was at the US Defence Department in 1991, before he was president, he had links with the Medellín drug cartel and was a friend of Pablo Escobar.</p>
<p class="contents">As if that were not enough, President Uribe’s policy in recent years has consisted exclusively in encouraging the paramilitary forces, so much so that a few months ago he invited the paramilitary leaders to Parliament, demonstrating that he is only prepared to talk to one side in this war. Even the relatives of Ingrid Betancourt have claimed that it is President Uribe who is opposed to any humanitarian exchange. In recent years the national security policy has focused on arbitrary mass detentions, the criminalisation of social conflict, massacres of trade unionists and violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the European Union should not declare its neutrality in this context but should rather encourage the search for a political solution to the conflict and the cessation of military hostilities, which President Uribe is currently promoting. We should make every effort to achieve compliance with the London Declaration of July 2003 and the recommendation made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in March 1994: let us remember that it is in fact the Colombian Government that has failed to keep to the agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to international and European cooperation, it should be noted that peace laboratory funds all too often end up in areas totally controlled by the paramilitaries. I believe the Commission and the Council should bear this in mind to a greater extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2001 a top IRA bomb-maker called Monaghan and two others were captured in Colombia while imparting terrorist expertise to the drug-funded Marxist guerrillas of FARC. Their mission on that occasion was to perfect a fuel airbomb with specialist equipment provided by the IRA. In two earlier visits organised by Sinn Féin's representative in Cuba, the IRA had already passed on to FARC its skill in making car bombs and mortars. Car bombs and mortars identical to those used by the IRA have since been used regularly by FARC. In return for its deadly expertise, Sinn Féin-IRA received six million dollars and the people of Colombia received mass murder and destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for me the Colombia adventure illustrates just how far Sinn Féin has to travel before it could be considered fit for government in any part of Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In that time, nothing has been easy, but the vast majority of Colombians – the vast majority, according to the figures – consider that the situation in the country is now better than it was two years ago. So it is no surprise that support for the Uribe administration is now greater than when he was elected, with a programme whose main objectives are to combat terrorism and bring peace to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the figures are encouraging. Public order has improved, although Colombia remains an insecure country. The number of terrorist attacks and hostage-takings has fallen, although attacks and hostage-taking still happen in Colombia. Drug production and exports have decreased, although Colombia is still a leading player in international drug-trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever people say, there has been no serious decline in human rights in Colombia. It is the terrorists who take hostages and demand money who are contravening human rights and international humanitarian laws: not those who refuse to give in to the hostage-takers’ blackmail.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing has been easy and a lot remains to be done. At the moment, in the midst of controversy, the Colombian Government is trying to advance negotiations with the AUC paramilitaries. In view of the acknowledged difficulties of this process, the European Union should take a much more active role by exerting pressure on the parties involved and ensuring that victims’ rights are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We work closely with Colombia, but we can do more at this particularly sensitive time, by supporting the Organization of American States with its broad and clear mandate in Colombia. This includes financing programmes to monitor the ceasefire, to provide legal assistance for the victims and socio-economic projects for demobilised guerrillas and their victims, facilitating the reintegration of combatants and creating mechanisms to prevent revenge killings.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a great deal remains to be done, and we in the European Union should and can help.</p>

I direct this particularly to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who accuses anyone who does not acknowledge that Colombia has made progress in respect for and quality of human rights in recent years of bad faith.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to recall something that Amnesty International wrote only a few months ago, when it pointed out that Colombia is the country where trade unionists run a greater risk than anywhere else in the world: 500 have been killed in the last four years. The High Commissioner for Refugees reminds us that there are three million displaced persons inside the country and that 300 000 people have been forced to flee abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">In this war of everybody against everybody else – I repeat: everybody against everybody else – everybody is to blame, including the guerrilla groups, of course, but also the armed forces, who in collaboration with the paramilitary groups – I am just saying what the international human rights agencies have told us – are directly involved in the killings, the torture and the intimidation carried out against human rights workers, trade unionists and local community leaders, who are summarily labelled as guerrillas or sympathisers.</p>
<p class="contents">The government’s strategy in this situation seems dangerously short-sighted. An agreement has been reached only with the paramilitaries: the <span class="italic">perdón y olvido</span> agreement – forgive and forget. New paramilitary groups have been formed: 150 000 peasant soldiers under direct army and police control.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe a less short-sighted approach is needed in addressing the problem of Colombia and that we should also consider what has happened in recent years to the <span class="italic">Plan Colombia</span>: USD 500 000 has gone straight into the pockets of a raft of US contractors. The <span class="italic">Plan Colombia</span>, Mr President, has been excellent business for a large number of US companies but much less so for Colombia, which continues to be torn apart by repression and war.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by asking the Commissioner, Parliament and our institutions to take a very careful and objective approach when giving support to the peace process in Colombia: in this process and in these negotiations the country cannot do without the involvement of all sides in the conflict – all sides, not just the paramilitaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the Uribe Government is still advocating an essentially military approach, whilst at the same time refusing to recognise the existence of an armed conflict with political roots. The European Union can do much more to promote peace in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the European Union can demand that the Colombian Government comply with the annual recommendations on human rights issued by the Union’s Office in Bogota, as a precondition for Community aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, European Union aid should be used to put an end to paramilitarism, which entails going far beyond simple disarmament, and going on to tackle the political and social elements underlying that paramilitarism.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union must clearly support and facilitate exploratory talks, political negotiations, and peace treaties between all parties, including the ELN and FARC.

Probably many people are unaware, or do not want to know, that in addition to the former presidential candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, over 3 000 Colombians are currently being held hostage by guerrillas in shocking, inhuman conditions in the jungle. I question whether this is the best way to fight for social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Not long ago, various MEPs from the previous Parliament welcomed President Uribe by leaving the Chamber in protest at the lack of democracy in Colombia. They were probably unaware – or did not want to know – that Mr Uribe had just won outright in the first round of the presidential elections: a feat unprecedented in Colombia’s history.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people may also be unaware, or choose not to know, that the FARC, ELN and AUC are organisations which appear on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations. Ignorance can be the only reason why an NGO from an EU Member State has just committed the crime of financing a terrorist organisation by providing USD 8 500 to the FARC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Uribe Government has begun dialogue with those paramilitary forces who are willing to disarm, with the only demand being that they lay down their weapons. The government has been criticised a great deal for doing so. The case of the FARC is different, however. Whilst they refuse to disarm, negotiations are not an option, and also whilst their ‘cleared area’ is not recognised: an area in which they continue to commit crimes. Let us not forget that five years ago President Pastrana sought to negotiate; but there was never any social support for the FARC, in a society weighed down by pain and the blood of loved ones.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mean time, via one of the most well-known NGOs, one part of the international community is committed to criticising the country’s legitimate democratic government. This influences and even sways many of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to remind you of Spain’s history. We only began to defeat the terrorism operating in Spain when the European Union started to treat it as something that had implications for all Europeans.

The European Union and indeed this Parliament are playing an important role in guaranteeing peace in parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that 500 trade unionists have been murdered over the last four years. Two hundred and fifty of those have been killed since President Uribe was elected as president, fifty of them in the last nine months.</p>

<p class="contents">I am concerned that the Commission is now talking about no ‘purely military’ solution, having talked previously about no solution without a negotiated settlement. I presume that is still the position. It worries me that it says ‘no purely military solution’. If we are going to accept that the Colombian Government has a right to use military force in certain circumstances, we have to insist that it act within the rule of law, particularly within the rule of international law, that human rights be protected and that trade unionists in particular be able to operate free from the threat of assassination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The connection between institutions operating under a cloak of democracy, paramilitary organisations and supergrasses – informers – has created and strengthened a repressive and violent network.</p>
<p class="contents">All manner of ploys are used. The pretexts of terrorism and drug trafficking are used to attack the people’s movement and to demolish areas that are suspected of being areas of the resistance, or areas supporting the resistance, to fascist infiltration.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of this struggle, in which Colombia is a leading player, are the social question and the country’s location. Progressive labour legislation has in recent years been subject to brutal attacks; being at the forefront of the social struggle, the Communists have borne the brunt of those attacks; one military operation has followed another without success; developments in neighbouring countries have meant that the task of policing and making the region a buffer has taken on greater urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">When so much is said by so many people about human rights, we should be paying much closer attention to the issue of Colombia, with condemnation, solidarity and combat, rather than the meddling, the military activity and the intervention with which the USA is always threatening the region, under the moniker of ‘The Colombia Plan’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
