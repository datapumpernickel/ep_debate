<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niinistö,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI)</span> Madam Speaker, Members of the European Parliament, may I first say how pleased I am to have the opportunity to come here to meet you and especially to be allowed to contribute my views to the macroeconomic dialogue, which is only just beginning. It is thus a new process. The adoption of a single currency in Europe has increased the need for dialogue on economic policy. Both the ECOFIN Council and the presidents for the euro area have seen evidence of this in their work.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the euro to quickly acquire the weight it deserves, not only as part of the international economy but also in discussions concerning the economic policy of the Union area, the common points of view on economic policy in the euro area in particular must be explored in more depth. The European Council in Helsinki is expecting a report from the ECOFIN Council on the development of coordination with respect to economic policy, which again will help to step up this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and monetary union opens many new possibilities for Europe. We must seize this opportunity and do everything possible to safeguard economic growth and employment development. The best way to do this is to ensure that the benefits of a single currency and a single market are fully exploited. The economic and monetary union means a new beginning for Europe, both in terms of entrepreneurship and of economic policy. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Employment Pact, which was signed last summer at the European Council at Cologne on the initiative of Germany, is an initiative which will promote mutual understanding and a reform of the European economies. The macroeconomic dialogue is part of the European Employment Pact. The implementation of this Pact begins with the organisation of the first macroeconomic dialogue, which will take place on Monday next week at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council. For the first time, all the prime movers at Union level will be seated at the same table: representatives of the Council, of the Commission, of the European Central Bank and of the parties in the labour market. Until now we have met up with representatives of the parties in the labour market twice a year, and been engaged in a separate dialogue with the ECB. Now we are coming together at the same event.</p>
<p class="contents">The participation of the ECB is a significant feature of this. It is a clear indication that the bank is prepared, for its own part, to be involved in open and direct discussions, and to justify its reasoning and its actions. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recognise the main principles of dialogue. They ensure that the independence and autonomy of the parties involved are respected. The dialogue will be based on confidentiality, which means that there is no intention of issuing joint conclusions or passing joint resolutions. The time will be used for discussions. There will be no public report on the discussions: each side will report to their own quarter on the content of the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">We may question the usefulness of the parties having confidential talks behind closed doors. The answer is that this dialogue is primarily aimed at generating an understanding of the fundamental principles of economic policy. It complements – but by no means excludes – public debate on economic policy, which takes place in any case. It is a lot easier to begin discussions on the basis of a common viewpoint and a joint analysis of the situation. It is not possible, of course, to arrive at anything as concrete as this at European level, nor is there reason to talk about negotiations or coordination. Even so, we believe that the dialogue will make a positive contribution to the climate of debate surrounding the issue of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland, the responsibility for dialogue on a political level lies with the Economics Council, whose duties and objectives are of a general and unofficial nature. We have found how beneficial it is to maintain contact through discussions, especially in difficult times. These discussions have concerned matters of principle regarding social and economic development. Similar practices exist in several countries. National experience and procedures, of course, are not directly transferable to European level but there is plenty to do at that level, too. Macroeconomic dialogue at European level cannot take the place of national dialogue, either. We need both. We just have to find the right content and form for the dialogue at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In our presidential capacity, we have also wanted to make sure that this dialogue works. It is for this reason that all 15 Member States are not present, only the representatives of the Council. This, too, is significant. The debate should not focus on the situation and problems of individual countries – the matters on the agenda concern the whole area, a joint area of responsibility. This provides significant parameters and policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The participants in this dialogue were specified in the conclusions of the European Council at Cologne, and it was declared that the limited number of participants would ensure the success of the dialogue. Naturally, we have acted accordingly. The conclusions of Cologne also emphasised the fact that the macroeconomic dialogue is perceived as a sustainable and on-going process. For this reason, in its arrangements, Finland has wanted to look ahead with an emphasis, above all, on continuity. Therefore, future presidents of the Council will also be taking part in the meeting, whose tasks it will be to develop and further deepen the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue is not about coordinating economic policies; it is linked with those current challenges which concern the development of economic policy cooperation. Much of the decision making that has an impact on economic development and employment still takes place within the Member States despite the introduction of the economic and monetary union. Above all, it is a question of budgetary policy and determination of wages. Can we be sure that the conditions and demands created by economic and monetary policy have been internalised? From the point of view of individual Member States, there is a risk, not of inflation, but of excessive nominal pay increases, which will lead to a sharp decline in competitiveness and profitability in business and, consequently, to job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Still, there is no reason to paint such a sombre picture. It is, however, vital that those who make decisions on economic policy – especially on monetary policy – can feel confident. That is why we need dialogue and reassuring signals, just as we need the decision makers to act swiftly and decisively in potential problem situations. This is a positive way of promoting the prospects of an economic policy which favours economic growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the dialogue, we also have to improve the statistics on economic development – including wage and cost trends – and the flow of information. The two levels of dialogue – technical and political – complement each other successfully. Discussions must be based on facts, and it would be better still if we could agree on these facts. It is, above all, a question of being realistic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, I would like to point out that macroeconomic dialogue forms part of the complex process of the Employment Pact and that, as the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has explained, it is a consequence of the Cologne decisions, trying, through the establishment of this dialogue between social partners and the people responsible for economic and budgetary policy with the participation of the European Central Bank, to achieve our ultimate objectives. In accordance with the broad guidelines of economic policy, these objectives simply consist of achieving stability in monetary policy through budgetary measures and wage trends which are appropriate and more favourable to growth and employment, including exchange rates and interest rates in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The macroeconomic dialogue will be initiated in accordance with this philosophy. Its significance has been clearly defined by the President-in-Office of the Council and I do not intend to insist on it. I simply want to point out that the first technical meeting took place on 29 October and the next will take place on 8 November. Despite previous experiences, such as the social dialogue established after Val-Duchesse, it is clear that the new macroeconomic dialogue has some different characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate – so as not to repeat part of what has already been said – on the contribution which the Commission made to the technical debate on 29 October. Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission’s Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs provided, prior to the debate, two working documents. One related to the economic situation and the other was intended to prepare the informal exchanges on macroeconomic policies in the medium term. Both documents should serve as technical contributions to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The first Commission document aimed to present the general economic situation and the macroeconomic perspectives in the short term. The diagnosis of trends for the European Union contained in this document is of a descriptive and analytical nature. And its contents confirm that it is possible to have a more rapid return to growth than the one announced by the Commission in its macroeconomic forecast in the spring. The growth announced for 1999 will be around 2%, similar to that established in the forecast. But this 2%, as an annual average, reflects a different performance. Performance was lower than expected in the first part of the year but, nevertheless, the upward trend which will occur in the second part of the year will favour growth of close to 3% as an average for the last two years, thereby reaching similar and even higher figures for 2000 than those which we had forecast in the spring. The document also includes the possibility that growth may be higher in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The second document presented by the Commission must serve to prepare for informal exchanges on macroeconomic policies in the medium term. The document presents the macroeconomic conditions needed to promote durable growth, drawing certain conclusions from the slow growth recorded in the past, especially since the middle of the 1970s. A technical analysis allows us to reach the conclusion that the deceleration of the growth tendency in the European Union can be explained by a combination of external impacts, exacerbated by divergence in national policies, in a context of structural rigidity. In particular, the lack of consensus on the content of macroeconomic policies in the period prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Maastricht and of the initial guidelines on economic policy played a fundamental role in the increase in negative effects, external impacts and the development of greater obstacles to growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising that the change to the rules introduced on the implementation of Economic and Monetary Union has lightened the load of those responsible for national macroeconomic policy and is helping to overcome these obstacles, so that growth may become more sustainable. The document analyses the conditions necessary so that the policy mix may continue to be as balanced as possible, thereby allowing us to achieve longer-lasting growth.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting on 29 October there was a discussion of this information which was very open and constructive, and I will tell you about this in a summarised fashion. With regard to the diagnosis of trends, all the participants agreed that the perspectives had improved considerably, and that the negative external impact of 1998 had already been absorbed by the internal development of the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to possible risks to future growth, there were differences of emphasis, especially when some of the participants pointed out the risk that further external impacts may affect the Union’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to economic policy – the second document provides a response to the challenge of transforming the current upturn into a sustainable process of higher growth – each participant expressed their position very frankly. However, I would like to emphasise some of the elements of the debate which may be very useful for the purposes of today’s debate. Firstly, the broad guidelines of economic policy are confirmed as a fundamental element. All the participants agreed on the need to maintain price stability and negotiate wage agreements which are compatible with the objective of continuing the process of consolidating the budgets – in accordance with each country’s stability programmes – and of completing the structural reforms in accordance with the Luxembourg and Cardiff processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that there was also absolute agreement on the key principle of the macroeconomic framework, which I referred to earlier. That is, the more we promote the objective of stability of monetary policy through budgetary measures and appropriate wage trends, the more favourable monetary conditions will be towards growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to point out that the discussion clearly demonstrated the usefulness of this type of direct exchange, which allows each of the participants to express, directly, their points of view and receive adequate answers from the other participants. The role of the social partners was fully recognised as a third element of the policy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, some of the ideas offered by the participants warrant special attention. I would like to highlight the fact that there was an emphasis on macroeconomic policies, particularly monetary policies, having to take into account progress on the supply side of the European economy. In this way, we will increase the possibility of sustaining, without inflation, higher growth in demand. The combination of the complete realisation of the single market together with the single currency, in a context of structural reform and strong international competition, will allow for a reduction in the risk of bottlenecks that may arise in the event that wage and budgetary policies are inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I would like to point out that the representatives of the Commission underlined the fact that the supply of labour currently seems to respond more positively than it did previously, but that there exists a significant reserve of qualified and available labour. If we add to this the availability of existing capacity, given the high potential tendency towards inflation, the consequence of raised profitability, structural changes will be put in place which those responsible for economic policy must take into account when adopting their respective decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">These are what seem to me to be the most relevant elements of the meeting of 29 October and which, today, as I said, I wanted to share with you so that you may then comment on them and debate them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction, I would first of all like, on behalf of our group, to put it on record that we regard the macroeconomic dialogue as a welcome innovation, because for the first time it obliges all the key players in European economic policy to participate in a direct exchange of views with each other about the overall economic situation. At the same time, we are delighted that Parliament has received this information so soon after the first meeting, although that should go without saying in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must add, however, as an Austrian, that this dialogue between social partners, between political institutions, between fiscal policy and those with a political mandate has been going on in a similar way for years in my homeland, Austria, and has made an important contribution to Austria’s present position as an economically successful and socially secure country with a high employment rate and lower jobless figures than others can boast. That should encourage us to take heart for this dialogue. There are a lot of things that we too need to reform and there is some room for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speaker touched upon this – the dialogue can only prepare, accompany and supplement. It is no substitute for policies. It does not relieve those in positions of responsibility from their specific obligations. The dialogue is a supplementary component of the many and various measures for growth and employment. And for precisely that reason I would also like to point out that this debate fits into the overall framework of these two plenary sittings. Our debates during these two days include the Smet report on working time and the Menrad reports on employment policy in the Member States in 1999 and 2000. And tomorrow’s agenda includes a debate on Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi’s question about the strategy for the European internal market, while last week in Strasbourg, in connection with the ECB report, there was a debate about how the macroeconomic dialogue with Parliament could be deepened and reinforced. That request has been taken on board in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that anyone would argue that comprehensive and coherent strategies are needed for growth and employment, and I am glad that the term growth and employment itself deals with the prejudice we so often hear from the left to the effect that growth can be set against employment, and that currency values and price stability can be set against employment measures. The dialogue and the name of this dialogue show that we are all in the same boat. It is a question of being willing to take an overall view and to accept overall responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The macroeconomic dialogue is a constructive way of tackling urgent problems. I therefore call on everyone involved to take part in this macroeconomic dialogue in a responsible manner and to accept this responsibility for the economic and employment policy future of Europe. We must eliminate constraints on growth and on business start-ups. We must fight the mood of pessimism and deliberate scare-mongering with a new intellectual, innovative, up-beat approach, and I hope that this dialogue will help us do what is needed at the right time, in an open and responsible fashion, and that it does not mean that mundane political opportunism or legitimate group interests will result in our obstructing each other.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the macroeconomic dialogue that the European employment pact has established is a highly praiseworthy new exercise. There is never enough dialogue between political leaders and economic operators. I would nevertheless like to question the real impact of a dialogue which is fixed beforehand by abstruse procedural rules. First of all, there is a technical level which allows fifteen experts to discuss matters and twenty-five other experts to listen; the political level will bring together twenty-four high representatives and 18 aides. It is understood in advance that the aim of this two-level dialogue is not to reach agreement on common guidelines or binding commitments; this dialogue will therefore not result in an ex ante agreement for the coordination of different fiscal, budgetary, monetary or even contractual policies. </p>
<p class="contents">Governments and the Central Bank will remain free to decide on their own respective policies. Their social partners will continue their free negotiation on conditions of work and pay. </p>
<p class="contents">What will be the added value of this exercise? Whilst I hope that I will be pleasantly surprised, please allow me to remain sceptical. To tell the truth, the European Union would gain from rationalising the different projects launched by successive Presidencies following the Amsterdam summit. Who, apart from the professionals involved in Community policy, is still involved in the processes known as Luxembourg, Cardiff, Vienna, Cologne and tomorrow Lisbon or Helsinki? The debates on employment guidelines which are, of course, always useful, overlap with discussions on the broad economic policy guidelines and now with the macroeconomic dialogue. </p>
<p class="contents">Green papers and white papers come one after another and are all more or less alike. The Commission’s communications pile up on top of reports and resolutions by Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. So many words, and quite often incomprehensible to the average citizen! Community texts look more and more like the political literature that used to be produced by the former Soviet Union. The bulk is made up of quotations and references to sacred texts adopted by the European Council or the Commission: replace plenum of the Central Committee with European Council and politburo by Commission and the texts become interchangeable. </p>
<p class="contents">European citizens do not expect more words, rather concrete measures for employment. Macroeconomic dialogue only makes sense if it results in macroeconomic action. Maintaining price stability is still crucial. Inflation affects the poorest people first but the Union’s sole ambition cannot be a policy of stability which is established as dogma. Each Member State taken individually is too open to other markets to practise a policy of growth in isolation. </p>
<p class="contents">The Union is a rather closed entity. Intercommunity trade represents some 90% of the common GDP. At a time when economic recovery might permit both a reduction of public deficits and a policy of maintaining growth, effective coordination of budgetary policies focusing mainly on infrastructural investments, research, education and training could achieve a sustainable economic revival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While accepting this approach, I would like to make two observations. The first takes up the observations of the Socialist representative with regard to the good sense in taking account of fundamental aspects, of structural reforms, which were already contained in the White Paper on Competitiveness and Employment. The report of the European Central Bank explains that there are certain problems in achieving greater levels of growth – or greater stability in the European Union or greater competitiveness in a process of open economy, needs which are even more accentuated bearing in mind the coming Millennium Round – specifically because certain structural aspects still need to be dealt with in more depth: from the labour markets to, as has been said, the training system, or other equally important aspects such as, for example, an improvement in the levels of research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would like to refer to the participants who must be taken into account in the macroeconomic dialogue and I would dare to suggest that three more should be added: the representatives of two institutions of the European Union itself, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – two institutions which represent an extremely important economic and social dimension and, in the case of the regions, clearly, some of them have an absolutely essential role in guaranteeing these objectives – and finally the organisations of small and medium-sized enterprises. All of us say that the SMEs play a very important and decisive role in ensuring greater growth and yet, I have not seen them incorporated into this macroeconomic dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these observations, I would like to reiterate our support for this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – I want to speak about three areas: context, dialogue and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the context within which this macroeconomic dialogue is taking place. There is a huge and vitally important factor missing although it is reflected in the Treaties and I refer of course, as you would expect me to, to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 2 refers to sustainable development as one of the objectives of the European Union, although many of us might question the methods which are set down to attain it. But certainly some of them are macroeconomic, as reflected in this debate. And sustainable development I would like to point out is not the same as sustainable growth which we have been hearing a lot about this afternoon. If growth is quantitative and not qualitative I would submit that we are actually creating instability by making money out of oil spills, clearing up after crime etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Article VI, Title 2 of the new Treaty clearly states that environmental considerations should be integrated into all areas of European Union policy and practice and we believe that includes macroeconomic dialogue. For example, climate change, if unchecked, is certainly destabilising to anybody’s economy as the European Union’s own research shows. Our own research also shows that economic development in the conventional sense is becoming limited in some areas due to lack of fresh water and that the European Union already produces more toxic waste than it can deal with as a by-product of economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment has therefore to be factored in and I would like to know how that is going to be done. Who is going to be represented? We would also like to ask for real dialogue within this, not just economic propaganda. It is essential that we look for new ways and the best ways to meet the objective of balanced and sustainable development in a way which meets our own needs, those of the environment and which does not have a negative impact on the living standards of those in the poor parts of the world. So how are we going to evaluate the wider effects of our own macroeconomic policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would ask for the democratic deficit in this process to be repaired, certainly at the next Intergovernmental Conference. I listened to the list of those who were going to be present and it struck me that the process is actually similar to what happens down the pub on a Friday night where you get together with your mates, then go home and tell people what happened and if you are lucky other people might hear the best stories.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to know how, as elected Members, we are going to be involved in this process, particularly if it is going to be as closed as has been laid out for us. It appears to me that we are not being treated as parliamentarians here, as being grown-up and mature enough to participate in the process of dialogue on macroeconomic policy, and I would urge you to change that and at least open up in the meantime so that we know what is happening and can explain it to our constituents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the same steady pace, however, mass unemployment, underemployment and part-time employment are also continuing to torment the working people of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Employment Pacts, the Cardiff, Luxembourg and Cologne processes and their combined effects, the macroeconomic dialogues and the technical and political bodies engaged in those dialogues are doing nothing positive to boost employment levels for the working people in Europe. This dramatic worsening of the unemployment situation is due to the initiatives being undertaken and the policy currently being pursued; that is, a policy which not only puts economic factors before social factors and price stability before social security, but also one which declares that the Stability Pact is the supreme law which must be applied at all times. This is not a policy for the working people, rather a policy for capital gains. </p>
<p class="contents">When the European Central Bank considers a growth rate of over 2.5% dangerous, whilst the Commission is calling for a growth rate of over 3% in order to reduce unemployment to 7% within 6-7 years, then this can only lead to greater pressure on the labour market which in turn will upset working relations. It will also lead to part-time employment, fewer jobs and reduced salaries, and it will cripple the social security system. From this viewpoint, the only success that can come of macroeconomic dialogue with the participation of employer and employee representatives is to enforce collective bargaining and readjust salaries to suit the demands of credit capital, the euro and the ruling economic policy which is guided by EMU and the Stability Pact. </p>
<p class="contents">The transparency which goes hand in hand with the procedures for macroeconomic dialogue and the continued absence of the European Parliament from this dialogue are giving rise to concerns that we are once again faced with attempts to overturn fundamental rights of workers and to undermine any social model still in existence in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, at the European Summit in Cologne, the Council decided on a European Employment Pact with a view to cutting unemployment substantially and permanently. One of the three main components of this Pact concerns the institutionalisation of the macroeconomic dialogue at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group would firstly like to state that this dialogue is the latest in a long line of hybrid “European talking-shops”. As the proposals stand at the moment, four parties are involved in this dialogue: representatives of the European institutions, of various committees, of employers and employees, the latter two insofar as they are organised at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this consultative body, on account of its tripolarity, embraces elements of both government and society. Its corporate nature casts uncertainty on who should be held responsible for the realisation of the macroeconomic policy and its implementation. In this way, transparency and the separation of powers, two key principles of our European democratic constitutional states, are not honoured at European level. Put more bluntly, they are being blatantly ignored and, as such, further jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, it is quite remarkable that the European Union appears to be assuming the dimensions of a state, whilst it is primarily a cooperative of national states and as such, could not be a state in itself and never will be. With this proposal, the European Union seems to have become too big for its own boots and chooses to ignore the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth point concerns the serious possibility of overlap with the Economic and Social Committee. The transparency of the process for developing the general guidelines for economic policy and employment policy would benefit more from an official and public recommendation by the Economic and Social Committee than from tripartite-flavoured consultation, the outcome of which has, at best, the quality of obligatory effort. Could the Commission explain how it views the relationship between the proposed macroeconomic dialogue and the existing Economic and Social Committee? Do European bodies not run the risk of endlessly repeating themselves? After all, meetings cost time and money. Could the European Commission indicate how it sees the intrinsic role of the Economic and Social Committee once the macroeconomic dialogue has been set up?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the macroeconomic dialogue concerns a field of policy with regard to which the European Union does not issue any legislation. Macroeconomic policy and employment policy are primarily a matter for the individual Member States. Needless to say, it is beneficial for Member States to exchange ideas and dovetail their policies, as far as the macroeconomic situation in the relevant country allows for this. General agreements are reached via guidelines, within which the Member States have sufficient scope for a degree of policy freedom necessary to incorporate measures which will accommodate the specific features of their national economy. Given this situation, a macroeconomic dialogue at European level is largely up in the air. Efforts are, of course, required to reduce the unemployment levels which are still far too high. We should, in particular, focus our attention on the long-term unemployed. But talks at an abstract European level do not create jobs. We therefore advocate freedom of policy at regional and local level because that is the level at which there is expertise in the actual labour market. Exchange of information and good practices at European level are highly commendable but the official institutionalisation of a European macroeconomic dialogue hardly has any impact on this, if any. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems that, apart from evoking the odd principle, there is nothing incisive, there are no proposals and there is no blunt analysis – and we need a blunt analysis of the state of many of the European economies, especially those of the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, when I hear talk of macroeconomic dialogue – given that the definition seems extremely evasive – the conciliation process in Italy comes to mind. What I am afraid of is that this macroeconomic dialogue will try to export to European level the method and mechanism of the Italian conciliation process, which is the method that has given our country its lowest growth rates, its highest unemployment levels and its highest inflation rates. In Italy, conciliation between social partners and the Government has become a pact between the representatives of established interests –unionist, political and those of <span class="italic">Confindustria</span> (the Italian Manufacturers’ Association) – seeking to protect the established interests and revenues from the possibility of the unemployed and all those who are not represented by conciliation having a place in the new economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, conciliation with the social partners has blocked all the strategies and the hypotheses for reform on the crucial points – I am thinking of the labour market, public spending and social security spending in particular, a labour market act which closely follows the one adopted in the seventies. Both the representative of the Council and the representative of the Commission were right only about one thing, that is the request for pay moderation. In Italy, starting with pay moderation, which the trade union oligarchs allowed, any plans for reforming the economy have been blocked. I wonder why we have to tell European workers that only one thing is certain, that their pay will be moderated. And I wonder why, on the other hand, we must not say that if – thanks to liberalisation and thanks to being able to accept the challenges of the new economy openly – we manage to reverse the downward trend in economic growth, there will be wealth and there will also be the prospect of salary increases. Instead of having collective national or European contracts, maybe these salary increases can be linked to productivity and the profits of firms. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think that we should use this dialogue, if necessary, to explain to the European citizens why employment has increased by 45% in twenty years in the United States but only by 4.12% in Europe. I think that the European unemployed, and maybe even immigrants need liberalisation, less State interference, less taxes and less State intervention in the economy. Maybe this would lead to economic growth and more employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What does macroeconomic dialogue actually mean? What could it mean? According to the sacred texts of the economy, it means conciliation and policy on revenues, which Mr Della Vedova has just reminded us have been around in Italy for some time, with the results he emphasised. So macroeconomic dialogue and policy on revenues basically come down to wage policy and pay moderation policy? Let us just admit it! A group such as the European People’s Party – Democrats cannot agree with this because its aim is the free functioning of the market, which leads to the free distribution of revenues, starting with workers’ income in particular. Workers’ income must be linked to productivity, and not to coordination strategies of varying degrees of obscurity decided upon by others. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, who are the participants in this macroeconomic dialogue? The Council? The States? The Commission? The European Union? The European Central Bank? Well, when free traders see the Central Bank in this group they go into a state of shock – a Central Bank can never be part of an assembly of this kind, never! If, in fact, the Central Bank tells the truth, it commits harikari, so to speak. If it does not tell the truth when talking to the other participants – as indeed it should not because the Central Bank should do otherwise – then it is telling lies and wasting time. Then there are the social partners. Well, these four participants are a highly dangerous mix which, on the one hand, is trying to eliminate Europe’s real problem, which is the lack of a real economic policy and, on the other hand is doing its best to clog up the system with negotiating games of varying degrees of obscurity, and to hell with unemployment and to hell with the market. </p>
<p class="contents">Just one more point. Cologne had based its hypothesis for an employment pact on three pillars, but too little is said about the third pillar, the liberalisation of the markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First there are those like the social partners or the central bank who have a direct influence on facets of the equation such as wage formation or the level of interest rates and then secondly, in a class of their own, are the European Commission and the Commission advisers on the direction, for example, of the policy mix. They do not directly affect any of the facets of the equation, they have not got that decision-making power. They are there to advise and influence. In this respect this institution is one of the Commission’s main interlocutors. We might disagree with the advice and the direction they will suggest but we will not have the right to be there at the macroeconomic dialogue to say so.</p>
<p class="contents">I am told that these sorts of things are technical issues and that we in Parliament should remain above them, but to me the issues that will be discussed in the macroeconomic dialogue that have been touched upon here are not technical, they are highly political and we, as the democratically elected institution, should have a part to play in that macroeconomic dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves the excuse of what some call the need for confidentiality, trust or even secrecy. Some have used the word secrecy. That is a retrograde step. We have found all sorts of ways in the budgetary procedure to find a working arrangement for this institution together with the Commission to maintain confidentiality and that could be done in relation to this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the content, I hope the macroeconomic dialogue will call for and take note of evidence on the success of the active labour market measures we have been increasingly pursuing since Luxembourg. Has that resulted in an increase in the effective supply of labour or do we need to hang on to the increasing unsustainable view that structural unemployment represents the bulk of unemployment? Can we begin to abandon concepts like that, can we perhaps begin to take a more realistic view in the setting of interest rates, a view which would accept that conditions have changed and that we can now begin to hold back on interest rate increases as unemployment falls so as not to choke off a fragile growth?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the sorts of points I would love to be at the macroeconomic dialogue next week to make, but sadly neither I nor any other Member of this institution will be allowed to be present at that meeting next week. That is a real retrograde step and an absolute shame.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Growth in the EU is still too low, and unemployment in the vast majority of countries unacceptably high. Quite simply, not enough is being done by the individual Member States. The tax system is still preventing new jobs from being created and, in fact, my own country, Sweden, is an example of one country where this is happening. Laws and regulations in the labour market, too, are still an obstacle to job creation and, where this issue too is concerned, I can cite Sweden as an example. According to a recent survey, it is Sweden and Germany which have the least flexible labour markets. </p>
<p class="contents">If the macroeconomic dialogue is to be fruitful and produce results, which is something we all want to happen, and if European countries together are to be able to provide better conditions for new job opportunities, then I am firmly of the view that all Member States without exception must participate in EMU. </p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, there is a debate going on at the moment about whether Sweden, including the Swedish Government, has less influence within the EU because we are at present outside EMU. Former Finance Minister Erik Åsbrink and – most recently, yesterday – former Commissioner Anita Gradin have expressed the view that this is the case. I fully share their opinion. </p>
<p class="contents">To believe that a macroeconomic dialogue can seriously be conducted if some Member States remain outside EMU while the majority of countries are a part of it is, in my view, an illusion which cannot be maintained in the long term. For the sake of employment and welfare throughout Europe, I am therefore looking for a clearer and sharper perspective upon EMU from the Commission and Commissioner Solbes Mira, as well as from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas said that “we are all in the same boat”. I should like to say to him, “no, unfortunately, we are still not all in the same boat”. But it is important that, in future, we should in fact be so.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a social catastrophe even in those European countries that claim to have the fewest unemployed people, and here we have the Cologne European Council and the European Commission, which are both content to gorge themselves on words as they talk about the European Employment pact. The measures that are envisaged though are ridiculous given the extent of the problem. The worst thing is that they are cynically using unemployment as an excuse to give more money to employers. The extra EUR 500 million that the European Central Bank is being asked to release on the pretext of stimulating job creation, as well as the EUR 1 billion for hi-tech SMEs are officially supposed to be used for investment. </p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to take one recent example, amongst so many of those big companies who make their workers redundant at a time when they are experiencing increased profits. The ABB Alston Power Trust is preparing to shed a large number of jobs in several countries within the Union, in England, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden, not to mention other countries in Europe or across the world. Why then does the Commission not use its authority to oppose these kinds of job cuts? It is deciding on a huge number of directives which have the force of law in the areas affecting competition. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall stop now. How can we understand the Commission’s refusal to react to this attitude of big companies, which is irresponsible in human and social terms, unless the explanation is that it serves the interests of these big companies and that it does nothing for the unemployed apart from offering words of consolation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the fact that very vague aims are expressed, in terms that are much more emotional than practical. The second is the way that they are formulated appears to be liberal but actually results in further constraints. </p>
<p class="contents">The first matter concerns the very vague aims of growth and employment. These are things that we have been promised for years. It has been discussed in Vienna, in Luxembourg, in Cardiff, and in goodness knows how many other places. We now have to recognise the fact that until now the Europe of full employment has been the same Europe that has made unemployment worse. This is unemployment that does not exist to the same degree in developed countries that are not Members of the Union such as Switzerland or Norway. To seriously address the problem of full employment would mean questioning the validity of removing borders but that will not come into the discussion, because that would mean opposing globalisation. It would mean questioning the validity of excessive taxation and bureaucracy but that will not come into the discussion because that would mean opposing the doctrines of socialism. It would mean questioning the validity of our immigration policy which takes a heavy toll of employment not to mention the costs that it incurs, but that will not come into the discussion either because it would mean opposing the orthodoxy of the single-system Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">I fear therefore, that the real problems will not be addressed but also – this is the second aspect, as vague as it is – that the terms of this dialogue will result in further constraints. We are being told that there will be dialogue, but the simple fact that certain subjects are being mentioned means that they will fall within the Union’s area of competence, and the Union is beginning to look more and more like the frog who ended up exploding because he wanted to become as big as a cow. We are also being told of coordination, harmonisation and cohesion; even striking a balance is mentioned, never constrictive regulations and detailed laws which would restrict everyone’s freedom. This, however, is the direction in which we are inexorably heading. Currency standardisation has resulted in the standardisation of financial policies; the standardisation of financial policies has resulted in the standardisation of economic policies and the standardisation of economic policies in the standardisation of social policies. We all know full well that this is the direction in which a hidden hand is leading us in this area. Hazy arguments will not bring about the freedom of nations, as they would have us believe; they serve only to hide the aims to which they would like to lead those nations. These aims are undoubtedly already known, but only by a select few. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regulatory policy necessary to supplement the European market on the road to a socially and environmentally sustainable European market economy cannot succeed in the European Union unless priority is given to community interest. Hence, also, the importance of the macroeconomic dialogue. The macroeconomic dialogue is not an end in itself. It serves to bring about growth with a positive impact on employment in the European Union and to help to overcome mass unemployment. It thus complements structural and labour market policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I wonder if we have really grasped the scale of this dialogue yet. In a society with such a great division of labour, it is essential for the economic actors’ activities to be coordinated, either by the market or through economic planning. I believe that market-led coordination will not work. We need political guidelines. That is why the Maastricht Treaty rightly emphasised in Article 103 that coordination of this kind is necessary. All we need now is the implementation measures. Unfortunately, national governments are either unwilling or unable to achieve the implementation measures, as mentioned in the Delors White Paper. We know a good many national governments which have seen that there is a major interdependence between monetary, financial and wages policies and which, like Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland or Denmark for example, have drawn the obvious conclusions, with positive consequences for the labour market and for budget consolidation as well. That is why I think it is incredibly important to make it clear that coordination means understanding the conflicting interests of the individual economic actors and getting them to act without having to limit their autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even today there is no real insight into this coordination, and I think that the ECB contribution to the last sitting highlighted the dangers we need to be aware of and how great the fears here are. We accordingly need a genuinely successful coordination of wages, monetary and finance policy. This will provide the basis for coordination across the European Union. It will not just imply good governance but also a European multi-level system of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">What actually strikes me is the failure to involve the European Parliament. I would like to stress once again that the European Parliament was calling for the coordination of policies long before the Maastricht Treaty existed, as a means of genuinely achieving European added value. I believe that nowadays transparency is a given for all democratic institutions. Just as we demand it of the European Central Bank in the dialogue, we must also call for greater transparency on the part of the Council of Finance Ministers, the Jumbo Council, the Social Affairs Council and the European Council, and demand direct European Parliament participation. It is not a question of confidential information or of keeping state secrets – although Members of Parliament are quite capable of that – it is really all about how we shape our future in the twenty-first century, and in that respect there should be no information, no analysis, no forecast that is dealt with <span class="italic">sub rosa</span>, no, everything must be genuinely accessible to the public. That is why I believe that European Parliament participation should really be required again. We are not talking about information like that at this sitting, or, following this sitting, at the joint meeting of the Council and the Commission with the two committees responsible. This is actually about dialogue with Parliament, because we really must ensure that we are involved here, so that in the interests of our citizens the macroeconomic dialogue truly creates really concrete guidelines that can then be taken up in the employment forum under the Portuguese Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But come now! Let us not present this as an institutional reform or as a significant step forward in the evolution of the European Union. What kind of dialogue is this? A confidential and secret dialogue? A dialogue with no flexibility, silent witnesses and no freedom of speech? And whom will this dialogue affect exactly? The European Central Bank which is not accountable to anybody? Governments which, or at least most of which, cleave to trade unions and the automatic guiding of the EMU, which will effectively function as a mechanism which embodies and by-passes collective bargaining?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this is making us regress; it is a return to the Privy Councils of pre-Cromwell days when there were no records of proceedings and the people knew nothing. From this point of view, I would like to congratulate Parliament for not participating. In my opinion, in refusing to take part in such short-lived institutional fabrications, the European Parliament, which is a vehicle for openness and transparency, is showing dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His reply was courteous and obliging, albeit rather reserved. He said that the exchange of information is fine, as long as absolutely no coordination of policy takes place beforehand. This reserve, which is somewhat exaggerated to my mind, is also something that can be detected in the other partners in the dialogue. If the leaders, the majority of whom are men, are in the least ambitious, then there will certainly be a healthy dose of scepticism at grass-roots level. This is also true of the circles I come from, the trade unions. There too, there is a rather sceptical attitude towards involving the government and central banks in wage development. </p>
<p class="contents">I think this is a serious case of getting cold feet. Surely, there is a whole world of possibilities between preliminary policy coordination on the one hand and complete non-commitment on the other. This world is what we refer to in the Netherlands as the “consultation system”, a set-up of frequent and reasonably structured consultations between the main socio-economic operators. This is a joint framework of analysis where attempts are made to come up with solutions to shared problems. </p>
<p class="contents">A key element of this process is the organisation and guarantee of trust, as well as commitment among the respective grass roots. The latter is essential but cannot be brought about overnight of course. It is a world which is yet to be conquered at EU level. In my opinion, this is one of the great challenges of this post-EMU era.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I regret that at the start of the process, parties are threatening to hide behind the interests of their own autonomy on their own patch of authority: the government with respect to their budgetary policy, the two sides of industry with regard to wage negotiations and the European Central Bank with regard to monetary policy. The very presence of this autonomy could make the dialogue so interesting. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also among those, as is Stephen Hughes, who would have liked to participate in last Friday’s meeting and who have had discussions with the European Central Bank on this rise in interest rates. I am convinced that various colleagues here in this House would have made a brilliant contribution to this debate. Whether this means that we could have made Mr Duisenberg change his mind is a different matter but this could perhaps be a goal for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, I would like to take part in this coming Monday’s political debate on the effects of this rise in interest rates, which will probably be implemented soon after, and by that I do not just mean the effects on the current financial rates but also on the real economy. There is a strong wish in Parliament to bring this about. I feel we should not only focus on this but in particular that we should also endeavour, together with our colleagues in the national parliaments, to enter into this debate with our government representatives and the European Commission. This is why it is so beneficial to have this debate now. I do hope that there is no question but that this will be carried through at heads of government level and I feel optimistic about Prodi’s initiatives in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely pointless to exclude the European Parliament from that discussion. We debate the annual economic report with the Council and the Commission. Last week we had Mr Duisenberg in the European Parliament to oversee the work of the European Central Bank. We have finance ministers coming before the Economic Committee of the European Parliament and we have the social partners also coming before the European Parliament. I hope that at this stage it is an oversight in not involving the European Parliament in this discussion. It seems to me a rather pointless exercise if we are not present.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to talk about the outputs from the dialogue. Frankly, that is much more important at this stage than who sits around the table at the first meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is called a macroeconomic dialogue. I hope it is a dialogue and not a monologue. Our experience from our discussions with the ECOFIN Council and the European Central Bank is that we are very much involved in a monologue. We sit and listen to the orthodoxy from the ECOFIN Council and we listen to the orthodoxy from the European Central Bank. They show absolutely no imagination whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The macroeconomic dialogue is critical. At the moment we are operating in a very benign economic environment. We have low inflation, we are returning to growth and things are reasonably stable. What happens in the future when we have a problem in our economy and where there is a serious external shock or a serious internal shock and you have to talk to the social partners and the other economic actors about some perhaps unpalatable measures that need to be taken at a European level?</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the president of the ECOFIN Council and to Commissioner Solbes Mira that what we set out in the macroeconomic dialogue in the next few days is not just for what is occurring at the present time, but to set the mood so that in the event of a problem or difficult issues we can actually sit together with the social partners and work out solutions to our problems. Equally, we do not want this monologue – having listened to Mr Duisenberg it will certainly run the risk of being a monologue – to be a discussion only about wage levels. There are many more things involved in the real economy of the European Union than the level of wages of people in employment. We need to look at the reform of labour markets. We need to look at the reform of the capital markets. We need to look at the reform of the product markets. All those things impact upon the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, my group will look with interest at the conclusion of the macroeconomic dialogue. We see this as a first step. But please involve us in the future and understand that in times of difficulty this dialogue could be critical to the way in which European citizens accept the institutions of the European Union when difficult decisions have to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is not totally clear to us where he wants to run with this baton. We are still afraid he will just do a few splendid laps of honour round the stadium for the gallery, and that we will have to make do with unproductive or inadequate results. I would like to emphasise what has already been said here about Parliament’s non-participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of European Parliament participation in this dialogue is more than just a slight drawback. There is a direct link between democratic productivity, the productivity of the results achieved through a dialogue of this kind, and the type of participation. None of you involved in the dialogue, neither the Council nor the Commission, nor the European Central Bank, will be held directly to account if European solutions fail to emerge – unlike those elected to this Parliament, unlike those who sit in this House and are considered directly responsible by the electors who have voted for us!</p>
<p class="contents">I warn you not to underestimate that point, because I believe that participation by Members will lead to better results in this case. There are pivotal shortcomings in the thought process. These relate to both the employment guidelines and to the key features of our economic policy. What is more, in some important areas thinking revolves around out-of-date ideas that public budgets can be consolidated just by limiting revenue and at the same time cutting expenditure. But that is not the sort of thinking that can eliminate remaining deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, experience in America has shown that you cannot save your way out of remaining deficits, but rather that you have to eliminate them through growth. That is why it is necessary to support the economic development process in Europe, so as to tap all the available potential. That is why we are asking you very directly as to when agreements will be reached in which concrete benchmarks will be negotiated on the contribution of public investment to steady growth, which is also bound to have a positive impact on the labour market? When will you finally agree quantitative and qualitative employment targets to ensure that employment is raised to the level prevalent in Japan or in the USA?

I believe that it is useful; it has certainly been interesting. It is important that Parliament is involved in these deliberations. I am obliged to confirm, however, that the European Council at Cologne very explicitly limited the number of participants in the dialogue proper, and that the country which holds the presidency of the Council cannot but comply with this restriction.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the macroeconomic dialogue will make progress and will bring results. This is quite an opportune time, but also a very challenging one. Economic growth seems to be underway, it is beginning to take shape. It does not present itself, however, as some fundamental reduction in unemployment. On the other hand, although there is unemployment, there are bottlenecks and a shortage of manpower in certain industries. This sort of situation is very challenging. It is important that we try to create confidence and faith in the future among the economy’s key players. In the private sector: those who provide employment; and consumers, who generate demand and opportunities for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As was mentioned earlier, the single currency has increased our opportunities, but at the same time also produced new risk factors. As far as the macroeconomic dialogue and its nature are concerned, I would like to express my agreement with what Mrs Randzio-Plath said earlier. It is important that the economy’s main players can enter into confidential discussions in so far as their duties overlap. Each one will have their own duties to perform, both the ECB and the social partners, but in places they are tangential to one another. It is important that these main players understand one another’s reasoning and basic points of departure.</p>
<p class="contents">As the country to hold the presidency, Finland also wants to stress the importance of transparency in this matter, although the operative word here is confidentiality. This is very much due to the fact that all participants are likely to speak about their own issues and their own area and may not necessarily be seeking joint decisions, but mutual understanding. I am convinced that Parliament will get its voice heard, and I for one will be very happy to convey news of this debate to the dialogue next Monday.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is in fact dangerous to glamorise and glorify the facts and create false expectations in the same way that it is dangerous to dash efforts and to generate feelings of emptiness and despair. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we should see macroeconomic dialogue in its true light. It is not a one-off event or even a process which will change the way things are in the European Union. It is, however, an innovation. It is a new endeavour which will enhance communication between those members and leaders of economic life who have never before sat at the same table. It is a dialogue between the masterminds of monetary policy, i.e. the European Central Bank, the political powers of Europe, represented by the Council and the Presidency, and the social partners, representing workers and manufacturers. We have full participation. All of us, the new Parliament and the new Commission alike, must act on a decision reached at the Cologne Council and it is important that we show the political will to develop, change and transform this dialogue since we are the ones who will be trying it out first, and with this first-hand experience we will be able to see where changes need to be made. I would like to stress that macroeconomic dialogue, as was also stipulated in Cologne, focuses in essence on the need for both employment and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly interesting agenda has emerged through the various participants in this dialogue on both a technical and political level. How effective can the action plans of the Member States and the employment policy with its 22 guidelines be in addressing the problems of structural unemployment, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment? Can restructuring within the labour market and the restructuring and reforms which must take place pursuant to the Cardiff decisions in both the products and services markets create the preconditions for monetary policy to operate within another framework? Alternatively, can the common currency, today’s low inflation rate and the anticipated growth rate create the necessary framework for job creation within the European Union? </p>
<p class="contents">When a dialogue at this level and with these procedures is only held twice a year, it is not possible for it to provide all the answers to such questions. But I believe that politically we must look at its positive side and consider the major concern of the peoples of Europe– after all, MEPs do represent the peoples of Europe and speak on their behalf – which is why the interesting yet burning issue of employment and unemployment is at the heart of macroeconomic dialogue. In other words, financiers, finance ministers and the unions of industry on the one hand, and the labour ministers and social partners in the area of trade unions on the other hand, are discussing employment and placing it at the top of the common policy agenda. That is precisely the reason why it would be worth our while to give this dialogue some time, to see how it progresses and to see the ensuing results, before we begin casting stones and calling for changes before it has even got under way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we are aware – and this has been explained well – that the dialogue is aimed at preparing the political debate, not replacing it. Therefore, it is an essential element of information which, unfortunately, cannot lead us, as some MEPs have suggested, to the definition of a different economic policy. The coordination of our economic policy is not on that level at the moment. Neither does the dialogue intend excessive consensus nor authoritarianism. It is an exchange of information with the aim that the different economic operators should understand the reality better and be able to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem regarding the content of the dialogue and of the members who take part in it is, and will always be, contentious. Should it include the issue of the environment? Should other elements be included which clearly relate to the economy but not to the aspects of macroeconomic policy to be applied at a particular moment? An increase in the content of the dialogue will possibly not make it more useful, but will cause it to lose some of its effectiveness because we will be causing greater dispersion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem, concerning who should or should not participate in the dialogue has been mentioned today. Should the Social and Economic Committee and the Committee of the Regions also have their place in the macroeconomic dialogue? They could undoubtedly make an interesting contribution despite the different nature of the participation of the businessmen and workers in, for example, the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the essential point which has been put forward – and I understand this perfectly – is the possibility of the European Parliament itself participating in the macroeconomic dialogue. Both the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have referred to this issue. You already know the situation, thanks to the decisions of the European Council. Having said that, what can we do and what are we doing? Of course, we can be here today, we can inform you of the work we have done up till now, and make ourselves available to you to carry on debating with Parliament the issues which are of interest with regard to the macroeconomic dialogue. The fact that you are not physically at the dialogue table does not mean that it is out of the question that Parliament may maintain a presence, with the opportunity to communicate its ideas. I believe that today, certain issues of interest have been highlighted. Is it necessary to pursue a policy of greater demand in the present context? Is it reasonable to continue to plan certain elements of the structural policies as has been decided? Is it useful to envisage, in the long term, the presence of Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, given that it is very likely that, in the future, the conditions of that dialogue will turn out to be different from the present ones?</p>
<p class="contents">These are questions which we have taken note of, which we will study very carefully, and obviously we will remain committed to keeping Parliament informed and even holding a debate with Parliament on those points which are of special interest to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
