The Presidency is constantly and closely following developments in the political situation in that country, and in particular the preparation and conduct of the elections on 6 March. The parliamentary elections in Moldova will also be observed by the OSCE. The Moldovan Government invited international observers a long time in advance, and I hope that Members of the European Parliament will also take part in this observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">As a future neighbouring country to the European Union, Moldova is of great importance to us. You will not be unaware of the fact that the electoral process is giving rise to certain concerns, particularly as regards the position of the media and the way the opposition is treated. The European Union examined all these issues with the Moldovan Government last autumn, during the visit of the Troika. We clearly reaffirmed that democratic practices must be respected and that the elections must be free and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, on the subject of the elections, the European Union issued a declaration, the principal elements of which are as follows. The European Union reminded Moldova that its relations with the EU would depend on its commitment to common values. This morning there has been a lot of talk about values and democracy in the Mediterranean context, and President Yushchenko has to some extent given us a master class in democracy and values. It is therefore important that Moldova should rejoin Europe in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has appealed to the Moldovan authorities to ensure that these elections take place in an open and fair climate, that the media coverage of the election campaign is pluralist and impartial, and that the State administration remains neutral towards all candidates and their supporters. The Union has also asked the authorities to ensure that the votes of expatriates are treated properly and impartially. Finally, the Union has appealed to the Moldovan Government to take into account the concerns raised by the OSCE’s fact-finding mission and to implement the joint recommendations established by the OSCE and the Venice Commission in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the issue was examined at the meeting of the EU-Moldova Cooperation Council held on 22 February in Brussels. Democratic reforms and the holding of free and fair elections are also important components of the EU-Moldova Action Plan adopted by the Cooperation Council in the context of the European neighbourhood policy. The action plan also refers to the subject of human rights in the context of our neighbourhood policy, a fact which was emphasised by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you, Mr President, that the Presidency will be closely following the electoral process in Moldova, which is an important step in the European future of that country, which is now faced with the choice of demonstrating that it is ready, one day, to rejoin the family of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, yesterday we had a EU Cooperation Council in which the new neighbourhood policy and the action plan for Moldova was adopted. We also had an excellent frank and open dialogue in which I personally participated. As my colleague pointed out, we clearly said that if Moldova really wants to get closer to the European Union then it is very important for it to also demonstrate that interest. I think that the elections which are to be held very soon, on 6 March, will be an excellent moment to show what is really going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldova really has to promote respect for human rights. It has to promote and empower civil society, it has to strengthen the independence of the media, and it has to ensure better follow-up of the Council of Europe's recommendations. I said all of that to them personally. We all agree that a vibrant democracy, a respect for the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free and independent media are necessary if it wants to promote the stability and prosperity of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Since independence in 1991, Moldova has had a rather good record of free and fair elections. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and ODIHR, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, confirmed in its report on Moldova that the last two parliamentary elections did indeed meet international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">To Moldova's credit very few elections in the newly independent states had been assessed in such a positive way. However, the OSCE's assessment of local elections since 2001 have reported that, unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated. The organisation noted shortcomings in the context of local government elections held in May and June 2003, including abuse of administrative resources, heavy bias of state media in favour of the incumbents and the arrest of prominent candidates. Reports on the October 2002 elections for the Governor of Gagauzia, an Autonomous Territorial Unit, also noted similar shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to the 2005 parliamentarian elections we are concerned that one of the joint recommendations, made by the OECE and Council of Europe Venice Commission, for improvements to the election legislation and administration have not really been completely implemented. Other reasons for concern include also the apparent lack of confidence in the central election commission, problems with the accuracy of voter registers, reported abuse of the administrative resources by the authorities, control by the ruling party and government of the public media, and pressure on the private media. In addition, up to one fourth of Moldova's population might not be able to cast their votes. This includes Moldovan citizens living abroad, or in Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday we heard from the government that there had also been some disturbances in the electoral process coming from outside the country. That is how they described it and I think we have to ensure that we observe these elections very carefully. As a result, the Commission has given funding for 25 specially named commissioners for this election observation, going into the OSCE/ODIHR mission. It is important to know that this will not be an easy task and we should remain very vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the visit to Moldova in January of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Mr Terry Davis, and the launch of the OSCE's election observation mission. I shall take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the very good work of this Council of Europe and OSCE support team.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in regular contact with our mission and, as I said, we are contributing EUR 50 000. This was mentioned again yesterday. I think the Moldovan delegation that wants to move towards Europe has shown great interest in trying to comply with the standards, but there is also some concern about the influences that might come from outside. Again, I hope that Parliament, together with the Commission, follows events very closely as it may prove crucial to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a country with a rich history, and a country where there have been clashes between ethnic and national interests, as well as cultural, religious, economic and political differences. Moldova is the point at which East meets West and Christianity meets Islam, and the point at which the interests of different rulers and powers have intersected throughout history. Moldova’s situation today is also difficult and complex. We must remember that this is a country that, following the collapse of the USSR, experienced a tragic war in the Transnistria area. This conflict has still not been finally resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldova is currently struggling with many economic and social problems. This sensitive region needs stability for the good of our entire continent. Stability can only be safeguarded by full democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and civil rights. Democracy cannot be imposed, it can only be supported, and this is our responsibility to Moldova today.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections on 6 March 2005 will be an important test of the extent to which the democratisation process has progressed, and of the extent to which the common good will prevail over individual interests. These elections will determine whether Moldova’s key economic, educational, and social problems will be successfully resolved. These elections may open a new phase of development, and thus also give rise to the implementation of the strategy adopted last year for future membership in the European Union. The elections will also set new challenges for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Next Sunday, the Moldovan people will be able to have their say about the composition of a new parliament, and that is, of course, an important day for that country, for those elections will also result in a new national government. I personally think that the poor shape Moldova itself is in will set the tone for the election campaign, because that country’s development over the past year does not really instil hope. It has now become Europe’s poorest country.</p>
<p class="contents">To us, I think that there are two other issues of key importance. Firstly, there is the issue of Transnistria and the quest for a solution to the unacceptable situation in that part of Moldova. I think that only a government with democratic legitimacy will have the authority to facilitate, and get involved in, new initiatives. There is now room for this.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, President Yushchenko made a clear statement about the new Ukrainian Government’s willingness to help find a solution, and this is where Ukraine’s help is absolutely necessary. What I think matters, though, is that the elections should result in a government possessing the authority to help find solutions. In addition, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, that country’s future orientation is an important topic, and by and large, the parties seem to be agreed on the need for it to draw closer to Europe and to the European Union. Needless to say, we would warmly welcome a new government in Chisinău setting course for Europe, and the action plan agreed upon with Moldova in the framework of the neighbourhood policy offers the concrete framework for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation and political relations with the European Union cannot be improved, however, unless the Moldovan Government’s mandate is based on an entirely democratic expression of the popular will; if not, it will be difficult to have dealings with that country in the years ahead. A government that has been legitimised by the population is the EU’s first contact and when that government opts for a credible European course, it can count on the EU’s support. When, however, the elections fail to meet democratic standards, that casts a shadow over future cooperation. A democratic and credible regime and leadership are a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> for European involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we urge the present government to make every effort to ensure that the elections and the campaigns be conducted fairly and openly, and that is why balanced access to the media must be guaranteed across the political divide.

In addition to being the least developed country in Europe, Moldova does not have control over the whole of its own territory. Its railway system is broken in two. Foreign military units are deployed on its territory against its will. Everything can be found there, including the worst forms of international crime and trafficking in weapons, drugs and human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The country has serious problems, but its people know how to live and survive in desperate economic circumstances as this is what they have to do. More than half the population is forced to survive on two dollars a day, and a fifth live on one dollar a day. If this is not a miracle, then there is no such thing as a miracle. For them there truly can be none. We must be, and are, in solidarity with them.</p>
<p class="contents">We all nurture hope in the expectation of democratic and economic changes. There will be elections in Moldova on 6 March, the results of which could increase our mutual cooperation and bring Moldova closer to the European Union. Romania is becoming a member of the European Union, there have been great changes in Ukraine, and we hope that they will also succeed in their wishes and that the wheels of development and democracy will begin to turn faster in Moldova.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that the Ukrainian president had used his speech today to encourage our friends in Moldova, because the Ukrainian example has demonstrated that outside interference does not help and cannot stop history. We wish them success as well as new and better opportunities to make progress, and we look forward to working with them after the elections.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches, yet its fate is closely bound up with the European Union. Only when the Transnistria conflict is resolved and Moldova can genuinely protect its own borders once more will it have the chance to develop economically. We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and that its young people are leaving in droves.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the resolution of this conflict is also important for us, and democratic elections are essential for this process. Democracy-building and successful economic development in Moldova will increase the European Union's security as well. I am pleased, therefore, that the Commission, the Council and Mr Solana have also finally understood – and I emphasise the word 'finally' – that a solution to the Transnistria conflict is a key security issue for Europe and that we must do all we can to move this process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, and I emphasise this point again too, democratic development in Moldova is the responsibility of its parties, government and administration. It is they who must now ensure that the elections are free and fair and take place without ballot-rigging, so that a government can be founded on trust and become a significant interlocutor for the EU. That is the signal which will set the Republic of Moldova on course towards the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner has mentioned several problems relating to the elections. We discussed these problems yesterday when preparing our resolution, and I believe that the motion before the House is an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the problem of the media, I have information from sources provided by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that there has nonetheless been a shift. Roughly half of broadcasting time in the state-owned media is allocated to the opposition and half to the ruling parties, with this rising to one to twenty in favour of the opposition in the private media.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems that the problems relating to voting by students have been resolved, since they will be able to vote both at their places of residence and at their places of study. There has also been a shift with regard to identification documents, as extensions have been granted both for passports from the Soviet era and for those about to expire.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it seems to me that progress has been made, and that there are no obstacles that could prevent the elections taking place democratically and transparently. It will, however, be up to us to monitor this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When discussing the political situation in Moldova, we should therefore remember that we are talking about democracy or the lack thereof in a country that will soon be a neighbour of the Union. If it is said when discussing Iraq and Iran that they will be neighbours of the European Union following Turkey’s entry into the Union in around 20 years, we should take an even greater interest in the Union’s present neighbours, such as Ukraine and Belarus, or Moldova, which will be our neighbour in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections that will take place in Moldova in 11 days will not be entirely credible if there continues to be no fair election campaign preceding them. At present there is no such campaign, and no sign of there being one. Yet elections without campaigns are like a fish out of water, and we must therefore judge the Moldovan authorities not only on whether they observe procedures on the day of the elections, but also on whether they ensure that a normal campaign takes place. At the same time, we should not forget that the elections in this country have an international context, whether we like it or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also the location of a frozen conflict in its breakaway territory of Transnistria, under Russian military protection since 1991, following a bloody secessionist conflict. This territory is a haven for gansterism, smuggling and money laundering and corrupts the local authorities around the Odessa oblast in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">President Voronin, whom I met a year ago, in spite of being a Communist and ethnically Russian, is committed to EU and NATO approximation for his country after a row with President Putin, who failed to withdraw Russian troops by 2002 from Transnistria, as agreed. I have no doubt that the parliamentary elections on 6 March, although far from perfect in terms of media bias in the run-up and the monopoly of administrative resources, will not be subject to the kind of fraud seen under Prime Minister Yanukovych in neighbouring Ukraine, which sparked off the famous Orange Revolution. The European Parliament, the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and NATO, as well as OSCE/ODIHR presence in Moldova, with Romanian and Ukrainian help, will prevent such a scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">The new parliament must help Romania, Ukraine, Russia, the USA and the EU get together with the Moldovan Government to solve the Transnistria problem. Reassurances of strong safeguards for Slav minorities must be given, probably along with a form of devolved government to the territory, which, after all, has never been part of historic Bessarabia or been Romanian speaking and which Stalin annexed cruelly to create Moldova 60 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally would start by advocating tightening of the sanctions against Tiraspol by asking President Yushchenko of Ukraine, who was here this morning, to further demonstrate his independence from Moscow by preventing Mr Smirnov and his 16 cronies from travelling to Ukraine as the EU has already done with the visa ban. I would also ask the Council to bring in a policy to prevent any aircraft landing in EU territory having taken off from Tiraspol military airport, thus ensuring they all fly out of Chisinau, where they can be openly inspected for smuggling, including arms trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s resolution confirms that the bold decision, made on 13 January, to offer EU membership to Ukraine was not made hastily.</p>
<p class="contents">The Moldova resolution is well balanced. We both confirm our support and indicate our understanding of complex situation in the region. Moldova’s territorial integrity has been breached: contrary to the wishes of the democratically elected government, foreign troops – the Russian army – are stationed there. By the way, it is ironic that today, 23 February, is the day that the Soviet Union’s vassal states, Estonia and Moldova included, were for decades required to celebrate as Soviet Army and Navy Day.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is ready to support the Moldovans, both in the process of European integration and in the restoration of their territorial integrity. The European Union, within the framework of the European Security<br />and Defence Policy – ESDP – must also be prepared to support border control between the Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. Today’s speech in Parliament by the Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko gives us cause to believe that Ukraine considers the solution of the Transnistria problem to be a serious issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The democracy of the Moldovan elections does not just depend on how the votes are counted. The elections are not democratic unless all political parties have fair and equal access to the media during the election campaign. I am referring here to Teleradio Moldova airtime. At the same time, opportunities for election advertising, both on the streets and in the media, must be made available. This is the minimum; without this, we cannot declare the elections on 6 March to be democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be prepared to treat Moldova on equal terms with Ukraine. I do not see any reasons why the European Parliament should not support Moldova’s European Union membership prospects during the democratic and economic reform processes. The first Copenhagen criterion – democracy – is, of course, a prerequisite for Europe’s support and cooperation, but the other two – a free market economy and the rule of law – are equally essential for Moldova. A clear position regarding these issues is necessary if we are to be honest with ourselves, with Europe, and with the Moldovans.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle that his country associates with Europe is democracy – and the democrats in the Republic of Moldova are looking to us as well. What they want from us is not only a commitment to them as Europeans, but also a clear signal over and above the neighbourhood strategy. That is why I believe that – especially in the light of events in its neighbour, Ukraine – we must offer Moldova a clearer perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Thessaloniki strategy, the EU mapped out a course for the countries of the Western Balkans. What about the countries that are only now shrugging off the shackles of the past? Ukraine has set a precedent. It is to be hoped that the Republic of Moldova will follow suit on 6 March, and even Belarus will in future have no option but to embark on the path towards democracy. What we need now is a Thessaloniki strategy for these three countries. It is an anachronism that the Republic of Moldova is the only country in the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe to have no prospect of accession to the European Union. It would be splendid if, very soon, this House could welcome a democratically elected President from the Republic of Moldova who is genuinely committed to democratic politics. At the moment, that is not the case, as I saw for myself during my visit to Chisinau ten days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, there is to be a European Republic of Moldova, the election on 6 March must be democratic. We appeal to our European friends in the Republic of Moldova to go and vote, to vote for democracy, and to make the Republic of Moldova freer, more democratic and more European so that this House can very soon bid their country welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would never have existed as a state had it not been for the pact between Stalin and Hitler that redrew the Soviet Union’s western borders on the eve of the Second World War. Both in the Romanian-speaking sector to the west of the Dniestr and in the Slavic sector to the east, there is shared nostalgia for the kind of society that existed in the days of the Soviet Union. All those circumstances are not the ideal foundation for democracy, tolerance, transparency and pluriformity. They can result in the different peoples seeking a regime whose authoritarianism is directed against those perceived as being opponents. One cannot therefore exclude the possibility the elections being as flawed as were last year’s in Ukraine and Belarus.

As we know, on 6 March Parliamentary elections will take place in Moldova, which I hope to be able to observe as a member of the European Parliament's delegation of election observers. However, today I would also like to express my concern about the pre-election situation in Moldova. The situation in Moldova is complicated above all because to this day the Transnistria problem remains unresolved. Neither the international community nor even the European Union have yet been able to persuade Russia to keep its 1999 Istanbul Commitments and withdraw its army from Transnistria. Transnistria has become a region involved in money laundering, and the manufacturing and illegal export of arms. This in turn, either directly or indirectly, serves organised crime and international terrorism. Today, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner expressed concern about the environment of the forthcoming elections, about the influence which some have been trying to exert from outside for some time. Yesterday Moldova's Prime Minister Tarlev spoke about this at a press conference in Brussels and today the world's news agencies are speaking about it. In conclusion I would like to express the hope, that the European Union and international community will not be impotent and that the European Union will not only observe the elections and monitor the situation, but will take concrete steps to help Moldova's democratic forces and will not allow the situation in that country to become unstable.

This is the big problem of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Moldova. The stand of the United States of America, which acknowledges precisely this intervention, is provocative. They protested through its embassy, accusing the government of Moldova, and this protest was of course also signed by the embassies of large European countries. None of the motions tabled has the courage to refer to this problem. You are not interested in democracy or genuine democratic elections. You want to subjugate Moldova.</p>

It has shown that we are interested in this country which, in spite of everything, is a little behind compared with general development in Europe, in other words development towards greater democracy and also development towards economic and social reform, the fight against corruption and the fight against trafficking in human beings, all subjects which are very important in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the lesson which we can draw from this debate, and on which Parliament, the Council and the Commission all agree, is, as someone has already said, to send a strong signal to Moldova, to the effect that it must not miss a historical opportunity in the wake of the events in Ukraine. I believe that this message should be transmitted clearly and firmly to the Moldovan authorities, not only with the elections in mind, but after the elections too. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has spoken about the European neighbourhood policy. By means of that policy, by means of our action plan, we must put pressure on the Moldovan authorities, the authorities currently in power but also those who will be in power tomorrow, so as to ensure that these reforms really are carried out and that they really do have some substance to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talked about it at length yesterday. As Austrian Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson-in-office in 2000 I tried <span class="italic">very</span> hard to find a solution to the Transnistrian problem. At the time there was a <span class="italic">rapprochement</span>. Prime Minister Primakov had been nominated by Russia and there was a chance to get somewhere. However, immediately afterwards, this question unfortunately erupted again and no solution has been found.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am very happy about the Secretary-General's new special representative, because it is very important to go further. This was said yesterday. We must do everything we can via our action plan, but we must also find a solution to this very difficult problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be going to Moldova shortly after the election, as soon as a new government has been formed. I said this yesterday at our meeting and I can also officially announce today that the Commission will open a new delegation there. If we want a new neighbourhood policy, then the time is now. It is important and I hope that I can combine my visit with the opening of such a delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldova is the poorest country in Europe today. But let us not to go too far. Let us act. Rhetoric and vision are necessary, but it is even more necessary to look at the complexity of the situation. I know the country because I went there many times in my former capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">Many things need to be done. The action plan is appropriate to that. Please look at the action plan. I have heard that some people want to go beyond the action plan, but this is not the time for that. It is now the time for the neighbourhood policy to bring these countries closer to the European Union. However, it is a question of give and take. These countries also have to accept the helping hand we are stretching out to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
