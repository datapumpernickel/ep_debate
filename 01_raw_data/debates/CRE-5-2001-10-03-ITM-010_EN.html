<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jonathan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I am honoured to have been asked by my colleague, Mr Agag Longo, to present his excellent and detailed report to Parliament on the Commission's XXXth report on competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report draws together several important areas of competition policy. The rapporteur restates Parliament's strong support for Commissioner Monti in spelling out that effective competition is not only an important engine of economic growth but also works to the advantage of consumers, through greater variety, better quality and lower prices for both goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">We congratulate the Commissioner on the success of European competition policy, but we recognise that such success can only be maintained by constant and rigorous monitoring. Our rapporteur has highlighted further measures to which Parliament will be giving its attention in the coming months. The future of car distribution is one area where we eagerly await the Commission's proposals. I believe that our initial evaluations suggest that consumers are missing out under the current exemption, with unjustifiable price variations between Member States. We also await the consultation on Merger Regulation No 4064/89. We welcome Commissioner Monti's positive approach to consultation with our committee, but we repeat our call for major constitutional change which gives Parliament real codecision power with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Monti has played the central role in fostering a global approach to competition policy and enforcement issues. Our committee supports efforts to build an international competition system in the framework of the WTO, whilst recognising that Europe's credibility in this area will depend on efficient and effective cooperation between the EU's own national competition authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also looking to the outcome of negotiations between the Commission and the Council on the Commission's proposals for reform of the enforcement regime under Articles 81 and 82 which we approved last month. Mr Agag Longo draws attention in his report to other important elements of Parliament's position on the reform, our strong support for Article 3 and our real concern over issues of legal certainty, as well as separation of powers. I know that Commissioner Monti is aware of this, but we have consistently argued that the Commission must guard against the danger that the reform may lead to inconsistent application or even to a renationalisation of competition policy, thereby destroying the single market. In continuing to raise these issues we reflect the concerns of many in the business community in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee has also underlined other competition concerns. We look to further market liberalisation, but we want effective enforcement of already agreed policy areas in the gas and the electricity sectors. The Commissioner is aware of the complaints which have been made about some acquisitions by companies which do not appear to operate in a liberalised home market and we look to the Commission to investigate whether state-aid rules have been breached in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Agag Longo also urges further progress on liberalisation in areas such as energy, transport and the postal services. We welcome the progress which the Commissioner has made on state aid control. We also support his work in ensuring that candidate countries for membership fully understand the requirements of EU competition policy, particularly the application and relevance of such rules in terms of market distortion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee will shortly respond in fuller detail to the Commission's ninth state aid survey, but this report also touches on this area. We applaud progress on implementation of a public register of state aid and a scoreboard as important tools for promoting transparency and democratic control, even if I embarrass Commissioner Monti by saying that his practical demonstration of the scoreboard to our committee was frustrated by technical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We view such widespread public access to information as essential. In the same light we welcome the continuing commitment to hold competition day seminars under each Council presidency, although we are keen to see wider public knowledge of, and participation in, such events.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on an entirely personal note, I would like to express my concern that the Commission has made particularly slow progress over complaints concerning the Spanish government's treatment of Gibraltar citizens in relation to telecoms matters. These complaints have been outstanding with the Commission for over five years, whilst the Commission has itself recently initiated a state aids investigation of Gibraltar's investment schemes, ordering it to cease forthwith until the Commission investigation is concluded. I am bound to say that this hardly seems to me to be an even-handed approach and I hope Commissioner Monti will agree to look into this. Otherwise I commend Mr Agag Longo's excellent report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That can be seen in the increasing conservation of structures. The Agag Longo report rightly mentions this. Following the successful liberalisations of the 1990s, postal services, electricity and gas are now trying to escape the annoyance of competition again. First liberalisation, then regulation again, and the heading for this scenario is self-preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda for the Heads of State and Government in Laeken expressly provides for a discussion of the tension between competition and the preservation of existing interests. We are all anxious to see whether competition can win through there. If we ask about the difference between our modern, open society and another society marked by classes and castes, the answer is clear: in our open society competition has become the order, the principle on which our culture is based. General acceptance of the principle of competition is therefore a tremendous cultural achievement. But the state has never submitted itself to this principle. It has always sheltered its education system, its banks, its railway, its airlines, its postal service, its telephone networks and its housing associations from the cold wind of competition. Many sectors of the economy, too, claim that competition cannot work for them or that exposure to competition could be detrimental to the objectives they pursue..</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of examples. Coal is valued because supplies are secure. The market is said to be harmful to the health service because patients would be unable to assess the services provided. In agriculture, the market is said to be inappropriate because farmers allegedly produce even more if prices are lower. The postal service cannot be set free to compete – not completely, at any rate – because it has social functions to fulfil. So we could go on. But all these paltry excuses have one thing in common: they all recognise competition in principle, but simply claim that the principle is not applicable in their most particular case.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Europe has without a doubt become more difficult again for competition policy. That is why it is important – and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for this – that EU competition policy should now finally be extended to energy, transport and pharmaceuticals. Let us therefore continue together to plan, campaign and argue for freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I must say firstly that I am truly perplexed. I am perplexed by the fact that a British Member, though talking in place of a Spanish Member, has raised an issue that in no way relates to the rules on competition, that in no way relates to the reports on competition, but which relates to the unacceptable existence of the only territory in the European Union still to be decolonised. It seems to me that to use the speaking time of a Spanish Member to raise these issues is, to say the very least, a discourtesy.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, leaving that aside, I believe that the discussion of the annual report on competition policy is a good opportunity to consider a debate on the progress and guidelines relating to this important European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be self-critical, I would like to ask you whether we are really holding this debate or whether we are simply restricting ourselves to voting on a resolution which, if we are going to be honest, is more a cause for pity than for glory. Please do not interpret this as a criticism of the Commissioner, Mr Monti, since I am more than happy to acknowledge his work in the area of competition and he has always been prepared to hold any necessary debates with this Parliament and has always been in favour of informing us promptly of the positions of his department. Neither do I have any intention of criticising the rapporteur, who has produced a report of high quality and has also done so with flexibility and tolerance, accepting the positions of various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that my comments relate more to the behaviour of this Parliament and, fundamentally, to the vestiges of an era when its was simply a consultative assembly and did not have the co-legislative role which it has now. We therefore have a tendency to issue documents, this document on the annual report on competition, and then go back to considering other issues on which we have already contributed as legislators, although unfortunately competition rules are excluded from the codecision procedure. Furthermore, there is not always coherence between what we say at one moment and what we say at another.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the report, I would like to congratulate Mr Agag once again on its content, most of which we agree with, and to make a comment. Once the Commission has taken its decision, I believe that there is no need for, and we should remove, the section relating to the prohibition of public companies investing capital in companies from the liberalised sectors – think of the conflict between <span class="italic">Electricité de France</span> and <span class="italic">Hidrocantábrico</span> – which Mr Agag introduces in his desire to stick up for and assist certain positions of the Spanish government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to express my gratitude for the cooperation I have received from Mr Longo in preparing the report. I should also like to thank Commissioner Monti for his strong commitment to competition policy in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take the opportunity to emphasise that the fight for free competition is a fight that must be engaged in ceaselessly. There are at present quite a few good examples of free competition’s being threatened as soon as the opportunity arises for disrupting it. The first, very telling example is the proposal tabled by the Commission to introduce an interim subsidy arrangement for certain types of shipbuilding. The background to the proposal is that we in Europe believe we are exposed to unfair competition from South Korea. Obviously, many interested parties try to exploit the situation in order to introduce a much higher level of subsidy than is justified by the realities of the situation. Where this matter is concerned, I therefore wish to call upon the European Parliament and my fellow MEPs here in the House to stand by the Council’s resolution from last year to abolish all direct subsidies for shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="contents">The next example of an attempt to exploit the situation is provided by the aviation industry which is experiencing a lot of turbulence in these very days and weeks. This has led many to campaign for the introduction of subsidies. I should like to remind you that the problems experienced by a number of carriers are not primarily due to the tragic events of 11 September, but rather to the fact that the airline companies are now facing the harsh realities earlier than expected. The whole sector has for a long time been in need of radical restructuring and, as politicians, we must ensure that the present frenzied and tumultuous situation is not used to introduce a mass of subsidies that are to be paid for by ourselves as taxpayers and that are designed to bail out a host of unprofitable companies and routes for which, as consumers, we shall have to pay the excess price over and above what we have paid in tax.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to return to a couple of specific points in the report. I think it important that we should hold the Commission to its assurance that the new competition rules do not mean a renationalisation of competition policy. It is also important that the Commission should continue to produce its annual report on State subsidies, even though it has now introduced the scoreboard for which I myself, for example, have for a long time been pressing and which I am very pleased about. It is also my hope that the Commission will be attentive to the desire for a start to be made as soon as possible on looking into the rules for the repayment of unlawfully allocated State subsidies – an area which leaves a lot to be desired. Finally, I hope that the Commission will follow up the request to look more closely into the possibility of improving the legal position of companies hit by losses and of involving third parties more extensively whenever the Commission deals with practical matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Agag Longo, and to Mr Evans for his speech. I admire the quality of Mr Agag Longo’s report and appreciate the many constructive observations that have been made. It does not escape me that the report also contains critical notes, and I assure you that, although it is impossible in this House to take a definite stand on all the observations made in the report, I can guarantee that all of them will be very carefully examined. I am also grateful to the other speakers in this sitting – Messrs Konrad and Berenguer Fuster and Ms Riis-Jørgensen – for their political and, I must add, their cultural support for the European Union’s competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The thirtieth annual report summarises the developments that have occurred during 2000. A quick glance is enough to realise that the competition sector has continued to show intense activity, with a total of 1206 new files, 564 cases of State aid, 345 mergers and acquisitions and 297 cases of monopolies. Work in the legislative field has focused on reform of our basic rules and regulations. This activity has led to approval of new regulations on block exemptions in horizontal agreement issues. New guidelines on vertical restraints have been adopted, in addition to the new 1999 block exemption regulation. You will know that these new formulations give greater weight to economic guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the number of cases of monopolies has fallen may be due to these new rules on vertical restraints, which have substantially reduced the obligation to notify this kind of agreement, and this gives the offices more room to concentrate on the more serious and difficult cases. Considerable progress has been made towards a reform of the competition rules, to which Parliament gave decisive support a month ago, adopting Mr Evans’s report by such a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of mergers, a communication on corrective provisions has been adopted, as has a simplified procedure for certain straightforward types of operation, so that now about 40 per cent of merger cases can be dealt with in this way. On the issue of controlling State aid, the Commission has introduced, for the first time, three groups of exemption regulations: on the application of the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rule, on aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and on aid for training. I accept Ms Riis-Jørgensen’s point about recovering illegal State aid, because I too believe it to be very important for overall credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards aid levels, the general trend that they are falling is confirmed, although this does not alter the fact that they remain very high. Allow me, Mr President, to highlight the fact that, in relation to State aid and contrary to what paragraph 2 of your motion for a resolution would suggest, the Commission has effectively already instigated proceedings against State aid in the form of tax facilities and, on 11 July, the number of them had risen to 15. We are also intensifying our efforts to recover the sums wrongly paid out in the form of State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now point out three aspects to which we are devoting special attention, not only in the last annual report but also in our everyday operations. The first and most important is the impact of competition policy on consumers. I know that Parliament shares our opinion that the consumer should be the final beneficiary of competition policy. It is certainly necessary to make consumers more aware of the benefits of competition policy and to inform citizens about our activity and the effects it has for them.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will have noticed, the report gives examples of certain decisions, showing the benefits resulting from them for consumers. A good example is the decision against OPEL Nederland to defend the right of consumers to buy a car without hindrance in a Member State in which prices are lower; other, more recent examples are an analogous decision against Volkswagen and the setting-up of an enquiry into mobile telecommunications prices charged by roaming operators. On the subject of cars, I accept what Mr Evans said: the Commission is working hard to draw up a proposal for the period subsequent to 30 September 2002, when the regulation for block exemption from the motor vehicle distribution agreement comes to an end. I intend to present a new draft regulation by the end of the year, and I am sure you will be glad to express your opinion on it, given the extreme interest Parliament has so far shown in this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to consumer information, may I remind you of the initiative of the European Competition Days, which grew out of discussions in this Parliament. After Lisbon, Paris and Stockholm, the next will be held under the Belgian Presidency in Antwerp on 11 October, and will focus on competition in the pharmaceutical sector.</p>
<p class="contents">A second priority we are working on – one which several people have mentioned this evening – concerns State aid, not only to make control stricter but also to make this subject more transparent through initiatives like the public register and the scoreboard, which is, in fact, readily available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority area of work concerns globalisation: how competition policy, by seeking greater coordination among the various parts of the world, can make its contribution to the governance of globalisation. In this respect – apart, of course, from the highly intense relationships within the European Union with the national competition authorities – outside the European Union we have set up close bilateral working relationships and begun most welcome and far-reaching cooperation in particular with the competition authorities of the United States, and last week we held an intense session of work in Washington, at which we planned further development of such bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that the bilateral dimension is not enough, and we are proceeding, with all the weight of conviction that the European Union has in this area, to develop two forms of multilateral cooperation. One is the proposal to introduce some basic, binding competition standards within the World Trade Organisation. The other is the recent initiative to launch a global competition forum to provide a venue for world-level discussions among competition authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Among our short-term priorities is the work now under way of modernising the competition rules, which we have been carrying out with even greater conviction – if that is possible – ever since Parliament gave us that vote by such a decisive majority. Within the year we intend to conclude the revision of the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> communication, which, by specifying which agreements between companies are not forbidden under Article 81, Paragraph 1, will reduce the burden on companies, especially smaller ones, of conforming to the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Having already mentioned the exemption regulation on cars, I should also like to refer to the policy against cartels, which is a basic pillar of any competition authority. By the end of this year we shall have further developed and updated the policy of indulgence, based on non-prosecution or reduced fines for those who collaborate in disclosing cartels. This is yet another area of convergence between the American and European approaches. In the matter of controlling mergers, the Commission’s priority for 2001 will be to continue to re-examine the mergers regulation. In this respect, during the year I intend to draw up a formal consultation document on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the way new cases are dealt with, our work is focusing particularly on the recently liberalised markets, which were mentioned particularly by Messrs Konrad, Evans and others, such as energy, air transport, telecommunications and postal services, in an attempt to prevent the former monopoly holders from abusing the positions of strength that they traditionally enjoyed.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you all once again for the expressions of support and encouragement you have given to the Commission in matters of competition: you know how important it is for the Commission and for me personally to have the support of Parliament in our everyday work, and how seriously we take your critical comments, which we value highly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
