<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lechner (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the Internet may have been seen until now as a source of information, it is now being used by the business world for buying and selling, and not just by businesses but by quite ordinary private individuals. Of course, this development within a rapidly expanding market with terrific growth rates ignores national borders and requires the provision of a Community framework. In recognition of this fact, the Commission has proposed a recommendation for a Directive on a Community framework for electronic signatures, in other words for signatures that are produced electronically rather than by hand. Parliament approved 32 amendments at the first reading in January 1999. The Council then presented its common position on 28 June 1999 having taken into consideration many of Parliament’s amendments. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market discussed the position and voted unanimously in favour of it, with 7 amendments, one of which we ought not to accept though. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss the following points. The directive is intended, first and foremost, for subscribers to open networks such as the Internet and does not affect the right to voluntary agreements in the context of closed systems. The Internet does not stop at European borders. For this reason, the directive aims to open up the market to third countries and provides for cross-border agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the future of electronic legal and business transactions essentially depends on whether we succeed in improving confidence in security, especially where the consumer is concerned, both in technical security as regards forgeries, for example, as well as in the legal validity of such processes. A crucial starting point for this is the electronic signature. By means of this kind of signature in electronic form, one can guarantee that the identity of the person who has made a declaration and signed it, the signatory in other words, can be immediately ascertained. In addition to this, the integrity of the data that have been supplied can also be ascertained.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the technical standards which the directive deals with, it is attempting to ensure technological openness. We should be able to achieve higher standards of security through such advanced signatures and qualified certificates. </p>
<p class="contents">The directive guarantees that the appropriate cryptographic products will be available throughout the Community without this being made dependent on approval. It will permit voluntary accreditation systems though, in order to promote the level of quality standards. It is envisaged that there will be a minimum liability for certification-service providers. It will have to be possible to use pseudonyms and data protection will also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">A crucial issue in subscribers’ confidence in the trustworthiness of legal transactions concluded electronically on the Internet is the legal validity of such actions. In future, advanced signatures will, as a matter of principle, be accorded the same status in the eyes of the law as hand-written signatures because they are particularly secure. However, the legal validity of ordinary signatures and their use as evidence ought not then to be denied as a matter of principle. </p>
<p class="contents">With this directive, which involves the first worldwide framework regulation of this kind, the European Union is making a first and crucial step towards both the regulation and the promotion of electronic commerce within the Community. This is designed to increase people’s confidence in the trustworthiness of open networks, in the services and products on offer and in the legal validity of business concluded on the Internet. It also makes a valuable contribution to the free trade in goods and services in the internal market, and indeed both for the consumer – if I may make a rather sensational comment: in terms of Internet shopping – and also for the suppliers of the necessary cryptographic services and products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer a word of thanks in particular to the Commission and to the Council for the extremely cooperative way in which they both worked together with Parliament. But my thanks also go to all my fellow Members of Parliament, from every group, not least those from the previous legislature period during which important preparatory work was done. </p>
<p class="contents">Our task consists mainly of painstakingly dismantling the divergent national regulations which have evolved, and of bringing them into line with one another. In this case, we are dealing with a newly developing technological and social reality, to which we can, from the outset, give legal form, through original European legislation, by means of which we will be able, at the same time, to prove our worth as a European Community of law in a particular way. </p>
<p class="contents">Divergent national regulations should not be allowed to develop at all, or become established over and above the current scope. For this reason, I also think that it is important that this directive should come into force as quickly as possible and so I ask you to give it your approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wuermeling (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, European regulations are often accused of lacking balance; either they are too bureaucratic, or they only serve certain interests, or they are even ignorant of worldwide developments. I think that we can say now that here we have an excellent example of the opposite. In the area of the approximation of laws, we must always try to find the difficult balance between necessary harmonisation, on the one hand, and consideration for the legal traditions that have evolved in Member States over the years on the other. This is an outstanding example of balance. On the one hand, a small number of clearly defined regulations relating to the requirements pertaining to electronic signatures will be laid down. On the other, Member States will be able to decide in which cases to accord these signatures equal status with conventional declarations of intent such as hand-written signatures, written proof, or other documentary evidence. </p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like to comment particularly on proposed Amendment No 2 which clarifies the rather misleading wording in Article 5(1). I would now like to emphasise once again that it was also confirmed to us by all sides in the discussions that were held in Committee that it is not automatically permitted to substitute an electronic signature with a personal one for certain form requirements as laid down by individual Member States. National legislature will have a completely free hand in deciding in which cases electronic signatures will be afforded the same status as hand-written ones. </p>
<p class="contents">This directive is a good example of balance between the interests of commerce, on the one hand, and the consumer on the other. What we have here is a precise, straightforward rule that lays down only a few requirements. Look at the appendices for example. But we also have the necessary protection to make such agreements binding and to make the supplier liable. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also a good example of, on the one hand, systematic action by the European Union within its borders, in the internal market, but is, at the same time, a way of opening up towards international cooperation. We have here a clear framework which applies first and foremost within the EU, but we have also laid down in the text of the directive itself, and this is particularly noteworthy, an openness towards international regulations. One can see very clearly in exactly this area that in terms of harmonisation within the EU, we are currently at an intermediate stage of regulation. We have the national level, we have the European level, and recently the international regulations level has increasingly been making its presence felt in more and more areas. It is good that we are clarifying here that precisely in the area of new technologies, in the area of electronic commerce, we are prepared to address these issues on a worldwide scale. Of course, this will also have a central role to play when it comes to the WTO negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that, as a new Member of this esteemed House, I have been able, in my maiden speech, to participate in a good piece of European lawmaking, and I hope that there will be broad agreement here with what I have said and that the Council of Ministers will not have any problems in adopting the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because in a matter such as the regulation of requirements for the recognition of electronic signatures, a rapid solution is at least as important as finding the proper solution. I am convinced that we have found both a rapid and proper solution for helping the electronic signature along and making it possible for there to be a breakthrough in the suitability for everyday use of the new information and communication media. </p>
<p class="contents">What strikes me as being particularly appropriate is the demarcation of the scope of closed and open systems, the neutrality of technology, enabling people in the legal field to apply these rules unambiguously, and the admissibility of pseudonyms. First and foremost, this will allow the consumer to remain anonymous on the net, as anonymous as in everyday business in the ‘offline’ world. It will also allow the prevention of a precise profiling of the consumer. </p>
<p class="contents">In accepting one of the amendments we want to establish this week that it is the responsibility of the Member States to stipulate those legal areas where the use of electronic signatures may apply. This clarification has certainly been necessary. However, I would like to see this clarification combined with a request, a request to Member States, to be as generous as possible here and to limit the applicability of electronic signatures and the equal status accorded them only in exceptional cases. </p>
<p class="contents">If we now more or less conclude the Directive on electronic signatures at second reading, it will be an important stage victory. The aim, which is to achieve a consistent and halfway-complete European legal framework for the information society, has not yet been achieved. For that, we still need the second reading on the Directive relating to e-commerce, the Directive relating to copyright and that relating to the distance selling of financial services. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would therefore like to appeal to the Council to establish its common position on these draft directives as quickly as possible, of course as far as possible on the basis of the amendments from first reading in this Parliament, in order to submit it to Parliament for second reading.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we discuss this, it is also important that we obtain a quick decision, as the rapporteur pointed out and as many others have emphasised. I support the rapporteur and am pleased about the Council’s view that a quick decision is wanted and that constructive dialogue has taken place. I think that, otherwise, the European market may well become fragmented because quite a lot of countries have now already adopted directives. It would therefore be unfortunate if we were not to obtain this directive. </p>
<p class="contents">I also think that this directive is clear, even though there have been certain discussions about its not specifying what formal requirements the Member States want to make in connection with different procedures. One unoriginal example which might be used to illustrate this is the fact that, if legislation in the Member States makes it a prerequisite that both parties be present simultaneously, then, in order to get married over the Internet, it is not enough for both parties to produce this type of signature. There is therefore a formal requirement there in the legislation, and this cannot be overturned. </p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about identification and security services of this type, I hope that we do not limit ourselves and think that it is just a question of numbers. Instead, we shall, in the future, have other forms of perhaps physical identification and verification, and I hope that this will be borne in mind when drafting the revision clause of the directive. Now, do not imagine that I have been watching too many James Bond films. No, this is in fact how it is going to be in the future, and that is why the revision clause is important. </p>
<p class="contents">The talk is of voluntary agreements and of a variety of options, but in actual fact it is important that the security requirements in this directive should be complied with so that signatures valid on a national basis also have international currency. It is also worth pointing out that the Commission has an important task in establishing both what are to be regarded as reliable signatures and what are to be regarded as secure arrangements. Where these matters are concerned, I hope that the Commission will establish standards which are economically correct, that this will be done in an open way and that no de facto monopoly will be created. We know in fact that standards in the information society have precisely this degree of significance. The directive gives the Commission a very great deal of power in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, within half a lifetime, we are entering a world which is going to be dominated by e-commerce, by new technologies and by signatures which do not exist in the old sense of the term and which therefore have to be authenticated in a new way. For many of us, and I am surprised Mrs Thors did not mention this, this is an exciting, equalising and liberating phenomenon because the old world was dominated by the great centres and peripheries were at a disadvantage compared with the centres. But in the new world of electronic commerce, there is no centre: the periphery is as central as the centre.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be a great thing for many of us in this House and certainly for Mr Miller and myself who represent Scotland here. Indeed it is such a very welcome development that we in the European Union should be setting out to create an adequate framework for this form of commerce – an adequate framework for mutual trust among citizens of the different countries because, after all, if anything acknowledges no frontier, it is the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, as other speakers have said, that this directive does a very good job. I would particularly like to congratulate my fellow new Member, Mr Lechner, on the job he did for us in the committee. My own group would have felt happier if there had been somewhat stronger protections for privacy as well as somewhat stronger data protection elements. No doubt in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity these remain with the Member States and I have no particular objection to that. But it may be something that we will need to revisit at another time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important, as has been said by others, that there will be a possibility for further development internationally because the frontiers of the EU are artificial frontiers when it comes to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be sure that when developing international agreements, we do not find things arise which are oppressive either to citizens or to consumers. Not all of us feel that the balance has always been well struck in the World Trade Organisation, for example, between environmental, consumer and worker protection and the liberalisation of trade. Let us not see that happen again in this domain. Our negotiators must fight hard for a fair and just framework as well as a free market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Worldwide electronic communications and business traffic in the field of information technology services are increasingly becoming more important products, and services in the field of information technologies will increase by over 100% within the European Union between now and the year 2001. Ten years ago, who would have believed there would be such an expansion in information technology services. E-mail was non-existent on personal computers worldwide, but this is now changing at an accelerating rate.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that new forms of business, particularly in the field of e-commerce, are developing. Equally, security standards must be provided and improved so as to protect the interests of consumers at all times. I read recently in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> that half the disputes which customers have with the Visa credit card company relate to Internet transactions. Therefore, procedures to improve security standards must be put in place as a matter of urgency. This should also include the legal recognition of electronic signatures, and certification services are needed to cope with this development. These are essential if the twin aims of consumer security and consumer confidence are to be secured.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council’s common position of June of this year seeks to establish a European framework for electronic signatures. For the first time the European regulatory framework for authentication services will be established and the legal recognition of electronic signatures ensured. In areas of rapid technological progress, the European Union must make a special effort to avert any future barriers in the internal market as a result of conflicting national rules and establish a European legal framework at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the implementation of uniform European rules can play an important pioneering role in influencing world level agreements. Parliament must take this into account when voting on this important directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish him every success in his work. I am very pleased by this development. I hope that with our vote we will accelerate the procedure as much as possible in order to finally allow electronic signatures to be recognised, something which already exists in practice. We are aware of the speed with which this system is growing and the fact that the world of the Internet, that is to say, the world of the users of the information society, is already well advanced as regards the validity of contracts and transactions via the electronic system. I would stress that we in the European Parliament should have been the pioneers of this, but we were not because our administration refused to comply with one of Parliament’s decisions. Some years ago, we voted on an amendment to the Rules of Procedure which aimed to make electronic signatures valid, especially as far as petitions and appeals to the Ombudsman were concerned. This would have allowed petitions to be presented via the Internet, increasing transparency and the chance to contact Parliament and the other institutions, for example the Ombudsman’s department. Well, despite this amendment, this provision has, to a large extent, remained a dead letter. Indeed, it is true that a petition can be presented via the Internet, but then written confirmation by the writers is always needed, which in fact makes this method redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that during the vote which we are about to take, the strength of Parliament’s wish will be affirmed in a way that will immediately establish the provision that will straight away allow more visibility, more transparency and give the citizens of Europe more access to our democratic life.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The point that he made very clearly is one which I believe to be very important – that this piece of legislation is one of a larger series of pieces of legislation which are going to regulate electronic commerce. That clearly is going to be very significant, not only for Europe, but for business round the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I should like to use my time to flag up one particular concern I have about the possible impact of the proposed – if I can use the horrid word – “Amsterdamised” versions of the Brussels and Rome Treaties relating to the operation of this part of the single market. As I understand the position, they may pose a serious threat to the market inasmuch as a number of the provisions look as if they will cut across the country of origin principle which, as the House knows, is the basis on which the single market is founded. If the country of origin principle is not honoured in the construction of the single market then I am concerned that it will not work to the benefit of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, electronic commerce is going to become ever more important to the economic and social wellbeing of the citizens of the European Union. If it turns out that the legal framework for that means of doing business is flawed, it is then going to jeopardise the wellbeing of all Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">And if, as I believe, it is the case that the erosion of the country of origin principle threatens fundamentally the single market in electronic services in Europe – and this, in turn, has a significant read-across to the operation of electronic commerce around the globe – that would be very sad and damaging for Europe’s citizens. It is something that we, as representatives of those citizens, should strive our utmost to ensure does not happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Electronic commerce is growing rapidly, which we find very positive. However, we still often fail to understand the cultural and political significance of the Internet. In the future, we shall obviously need a movement to uphold civil rights in electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic signatures ensure the security of electronic commerce, and that is important. We need growing trade, for example, so that we can improve our competitiveness with the United States. Our use of the Internet is only one third of that in the U.S. Even though three passwords would be needed for one transaction, and two of them would be changed each time, the system is not completely secure. If hackers can access Pentagon files, then obviously they can also access electronic commerce networks. In retail trade, where losses due to theft might be about 1% of sales, it is the retail trade that suffers. In electronic commerce the customer suffers too, and very often just the customer. For this reason, the importance of security cannot be sufficiently emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">We need international cooperation, as has been proposed here already earlier this evening. To secure extensive cooperation we should set up an Internet police force comparable to the traffic police. But imagine how much higher the speed is and how much longer the roads are than in ordinary road traffic. It is also important that surveillance take place where the action is. This will require international cooperation and much effort from our negotiators at the WTO round of talks. We also want to protect minorities, and the largest minority in all countries is the poor. I await the time when they too can access the Internet, and I hope that the Commission will take action to that effect.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the Directive on a Community framework for electronic signatures, the European Union is taking an important step towards breaking down the barriers to electronic commerce. Until now, the legal position of electronic signatures has been unclear, and it has been particularly open to question whether electronic statements with a digital signature can be accepted as evidence in legal proceedings. These problems will now diminish since, according to the directive, in future, legally binding declarations may also be submitted electronically, thereby facilitating electronic commerce. </p>
<p class="contents">The directive is the first step on the way to achieving a comprehensive legal framework for electronic commerce. Amongst other things, it points the way for the Directive relating to electronic business transactions, for the Directive relating to distance selling and in part for the Directive relating to copyright which will both soon be dealt with at second reading in the European Parliament. My colleague, Mr Wuermeling, has already quite rightly clarified the fact that the directive leaves it to the Member States to determine when an electronic declaration of intent which is signed with a digital signature should be taken to be equal to a signed statement or to a statement for which the law stipulates, for example, that a hand-written signature is necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that the directive exempts national contract law, in particular provisions on the drawing up and fulfilment of contracts, from its scope, and concentrates on essential matters. I have two more very brief observations on the directive. Firstly, it is extremely important that a Europe-wide system for electronic signatures is established, one which will be open to global developments and ready to integrate them. Here, too, it is incumbent on the Commission to take up contact with third countries and international organisations in order to find appropriate solutions. It will be of particular interest to observe in this context which recommendations the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the OECD and the WTO are developing in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be our aim to ensure that electronic signatures are recognised across borders, in other words, to establish an internationally compatible framework. Secondly, I would like to stress, and with this I shall also conclude my speech, how important and urgent it is for there at last to be regulations governing market access for the certification service providers, for internal market principles to be applied and for there to be liability regulations. It is high time that through the adoption of uniform provisions, both for certification services providers and for consumers, consistency of law is achieved, so that – as is the case when credit cards are used – they will then know exactly to what extent there is a risk of them being threatened with liability.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Lechner on the way he has presented the report and I particularly commend him for not trying to add too much to what was basically a sound directive. There is always the temptation for rapporteurs to add some new aspects but he has wisely resisted that temptation.</p>
<p class="contents">I made my first speech in this House back in July in commending the initiative of the Finnish Presidency in giving priority to information society issues. It is a particular pleasure to be able to make some comments on the directive which we are discussing today and to build on what a number of colleagues have said: in that this is a crucial measure in that it is the first of a series. The way we deal with this in this House, in the Commission, in the Union, will be very important for the development of electronic commerce in the future. In making this closing contribution I want to think ahead about the implications of this for other directives and also to request to the Commission in particular to make sure that this first directive is very closely monitored in the way that it operates in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague, Mrs Berger, and a number of other speakers pointed out, there is a certain amount of flexibility given to member governments as to how they implement this directive. We want to make sure that they do not add provisions to this directive, make it too restrictive, or too intrusive so that it will choke off the development or the use of electronic signatures and thereby hold back the development of electronic commerce itself. That, after all, is what we want to achieve with the legislation that comes here. We want legislation that will encourage the development of electronic commerce from the consumer’s perspective and encourage businesses to move into this new age of directly connected business.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic signatures will be very important in giving consumers that security to encourage them to take on electronic business. I therefore ask the Commission to make sure that they monitor this aspect of the directive at the level of national governments to make sure that it is working effectively and achieving its aims of encouraging consumers and businesses to participate in the electronic revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and important aspect of this directive is that it has been made technologically neutral. It is not the job of politicians to determine technological solutions. We are living in a very fast-moving world, where new products are developed in months, come to the market very quickly, are on offer very quickly and accepted by consumers very quickly. We must make sure that our legislation does not close off technological options or inhibit engineers and software engineers from developing new products. Again, this is something I would like to ask the Commission to monitor carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">The final – and I think crucial – point for the development of electronic commerce across the Union is that we must provide a framework that encourages smaller businesses to get involved in electronic commerce. If we do not encourage the small businesses, the micro businesses, to take advantage of the immense power of this technology to open up international markets quickly and cheaply, to enable them to offer new products in a very simple and effective way direct to the customer, then I suggest that we will have failed. Again, we must look at how this directive operates in small- and medium-sized businesses and in particular, to pick up on the point of my colleague, Lord Inglewood, we must ensure that the changes in the overall legal framework do not have the potential to frustrate the entry into electronic commerce of smaller businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this legislation. I leave those pointers and I hope that the Commission will pick them up in moving forward into this new era of framework legislation for electronic commerce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say for the first time in this Parliament that I have agreed with all the speakers. It has been very constructive and different viewpoints have been presented here. In particular, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, on his constructive report.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress in Parliament has also been of symbolic importance for future issues in the same area. The rapidity of the technological change is such that we need to strike a balance between rapid procedures and flexible legislation. Otherwise, we shall not be able to meet the requirements of the huge changes we see every day in the information society in its different sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive which is on the agenda today deals with the use and legal recognition of electronic signatures. This is very important, as has been said so many times today. Doing business electronically is increasing rapidly both for companies and for consumers. The Internet will be pervasive in Europe in a matter of five years or so. We can expect half of the European population to be connected to the Internet by 2005 and not only via PC, but increasingly via mobile communication devices. That was the message everyone received from Geneva Telecom two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of electronic signatures is an important means of ensuring authenticity in the future electronic world. Without it there will be no safe electronic communications for European citizens. In fact, even further growth in Internet usage may even be slowed down due to the growing concerns of security and privacy. The bottom line is that without security and trust there will not be a notable shift towards commercial and financial transactions on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is not designed to regulate everything, neither is it meant to replace the market. It offers legal recognition of electronic signatures where currently only the paper form is recognised, thus providing for more security in the market place. Furthermore, it secures the internal market for electronic signature products and services. But there is also a considerable international dimension to this initiative. The Internet and e-commerce are global by nature. Therefore, other international organisations like the United Nations and the OECD are increasingly active in the field of electronic signatures. Almost all US states either have an electronic signature law in place or are preparing one. Japan is also drafting a law in this area. Hence, having a harmonised European legal framework in place would strengthen Europe’s position in the international context.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need this directive to avoid divergent approaches in Member States’ law, as has been mentioned. Today, all EU Member States agree on the importance of electronic signatures to ensure security and trust in electronic communication. This is good news. We can build on this by avoiding obstacles to the free circulation of electronic signature products and services within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the amendments proposed, the Commission can accept them with the exception of one. We have a problem with Amendment No 6 because, according to our interpretation, it goes against the Treaty because the Treaty provides that these kinds of proposals must be submitted to the Council. In that context the European Parliament is not mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I want to repeat that I am very pleased about the high degree of consensus between the positions of the Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interests of all of us to support the fast progress of this matter. With this aim in mind, I should like to suggest that Parliament reconsider Amendment No 6 in order to avoid an unnecessary conciliation procedure.
