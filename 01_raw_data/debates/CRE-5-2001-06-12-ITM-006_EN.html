The reason I requested the floor is that the opinion of Parliament has been sought on this framework decision. The rapporteur had also received a personal assurance that the Council would not act until Parliament had delivered its opinion. It has no option in any case, because Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union states that the Council shall consult the European Parliament before adopting any measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, however, has already discussed this matter and took its decision on 28 May, reaching agreement on all but one point. So to all intents and purposes, the Council has already decided on this matter, even though we were unable to debate this issue until yesterday and although we are not yet in a position to present the Council with our decision in the form of a corrigendum. This means that it is the duty of our Parliament to protest in the strongest possible terms, which I wish to do herewith, firstly because the Council went back on its word and secondly because it infringed Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which it has done repeatedly.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European People’s Party reserve the right to take further action, but we expect the Council to answer our charge and explain its absolutely unacceptable behaviour, informing the European Parliament why it not only violated the Treaty but also showed contempt for the work of Parliament.</p>

The traceability of primary products at the processing and marketing stages is of extreme importance to consumers and farmers, and I can only keep re-emphasising this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me suggest, however, that consideration of the relative size of businesses is indispensable and that small businesses cannot be treated in the same way as multinational food corporations. Moreover, I also find it regrettable, Mr President, that there are no derogations from these provisions for farming businesses which produce their own livestock feed.</p>

In reality, however, we are watching the creation of a perfectly deliberate system intended to hinder those Member States who would like to use their own powers of national safeguard in the case of a public-health crisis (as France did at the end of 1999, when, to the chagrin of the Commission, it continued to maintain its unilateral embargo on British beef), and in so doing to preserve as much as possible the sacrosanct free circulation of products.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the only objective of the new European body is to give scientific opinions to the Community institutions and to Member States, it is obvious that it will circumvent or neutralise the opinions of national food-safety agencies, such as the AFSSA in France, so as to prevent governments from having a legitimate reason to base their decisions on those agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The new body is to be governed by a management board composed of 16 members, four of whom will be appointed by the European Parliament, four by the Council, four by the Commission and the other four acting as representatives of consumers and the industry, and appointed by the Commission (Article 24). Half of the members are thus appointed by the Commission, and all of them are appointed by the European institutions. None of them are appointed by the national food-safety agencies, which would have been essential if everyone was supposed to be working together as a network, but obviously that was never the intention.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to sew things up even more securely, the executive director will be appointed by the management board, following a proposal by the Commission (Article 25) and the members of the scientific groups will be appointed by that same board, following a proposal by the executive director (Article 27). Who is going to believe that such a structure will not support the Commission’s views?</p>
<p class="contents">Article 22 explains that the new system will provide ‘the best possible scientific opinions’, thereby devaluing all others. The central body is called ‘the European Food Authority’ (or ‘the Authority’ for short, with a capital ‘A’). The name should have been ‘Agency’ because in theory this body will be simply issuing opinions, but the Commission insists absolutely on the word ‘Authority’, and it is easy to see why. Moreover, it is a ‘Food Authority’ rather than a ‘Food Safety Authority’, so as to expand its scope to cover the vast areas listed in Article 21. Among the areas listed, we also find, placed modestly at the end, genetically modified organisms. Who could be in any doubt that one of the first ‘opinions’ of the ‘Authority’ will advise that the issuing of authorisations for GMOs should be resumed?</p>
<p class="contents">We are dismayed, yet again, to see national states allowing themselves to be caught in such crude traps, which will mean that in future they will no longer be able to protect their citizens. Yet when all is said and done, perhaps that is what they really want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is needed is a change in the EU’s current policies affecting the safety of food, namely, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. Highly intensive production and the quest for greater profits have had damaging consequences on the overall safety of food, with high costs for both human and animal health, as we have seen in the cases of BSE, dioxins and, more recently, with foot-and-mouth disease. The European Food Safety Authority must not be a smokescreen for public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an authority that guarantees risk assessment for food safety, underpinned by solid scientific opinion, must not take responsibility from or replace the Commission or the competent authorities in each Member State in managing the risks of Community food policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole food chain must be involved, with the spotlight on the role of the agri-foodstuff industry in food safety. We agreed that the underlying principle of any legislation on food is to protect human health and it is this very reason that makes it crucial to apply the precautionary principle to risk management, when scientific data are insufficient or inconclusive. Food traceability, with an integrated ‘from farm to fork’ approach is the right principle, although questions have rightly been raised about its immediate implementation in Portugal with no transitional period, which would enable account to be taken of the specific characteristics of our agricultural production and of the sectors involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The question must nevertheless be asked whether a structure that is so cumbersome from the administrative and budgetary point of view is really necessary and this also applies to appointing the members of the management board, in which the authorities of each Member State should have a greater role.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all of this, we consider the amendments tabled by Parliament on the need for imported produce to respect Community legislation to be crucial, as is extending the legislation’s coverage to encompass animal feedingstuffs too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In principle, I am not in favour of the creation of an agency. Just lately, there has been a proliferation of these new agencies: a European Maritime Safety Agency, a European Aviation Safety Agency etc. A new Community bureaucracy is being created, and I deplore it. However, certain circumstances may lead us to consider whether we need to create a special authority, and this is the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of this report is in fact the result of a sad admission – that the European Commission has shown itself to be incapable of reacting effectively to various food crises.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make up for the shortcomings of the Commission, therefore, to respond to consumers’ and farmers’ expectations and to restore their confidence, the setting up of a special authority for food safety may be an effective alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two essential principles that should guide the actions of the Food Authority: it is essential to give it a clear mission, and to make a distinction between what can be classified as scientific responsibility on the one hand, and what can be classified as political responsibility on the other. The authority must focus on identifying and assessing risks, coordinating its activities with those of the national agencies and supplying all the information that is needed. Under no circumstances can the Food Authority have the task of managing the rapid alert system. That is an instrument for the consumer’s use, and the decision on the measures to be taken belongs entirely and exclusively in the political sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of where this authority should be situated, I voted in favour of Amendment No 188 in its entirety. France is one of the great founding countries of the Union. It should demonstrate to its partners its commitment to Europe by transposing the European directives into its national legislation as quickly as possible. So far, however, my country has remained one of the worst offenders in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">By voting as I have done, I simply wish to send a strong signal to political leaders in France, to tell them that this situation must be remedied. That is how France will enhance its prestige and its voice will carry greater weight during the forthcoming negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The White Paper on Food Safety is dated January 2000. We are halfway through 2001 and we are not yet in a position to say when this Authority is likely to come into operation. There are multiple practical problems to be resolved, but the proposals have arrived late and we will not know when the measures intended to prevent the outbreak and spread of contamination will be implemented. I deplore this irresponsible delay, because I refuse to make consumers and producers run the risks and face the real damage produced, for example, by the spread of mad cow disease. While waiting for the procedures to take their course, and for the governments and the Commission to reach agreement on the proposals from Parliament on responsibility for assessment and notification of risk and its management – the latter should be the exclusive responsibility of the Commission – we again propose the establishment of a provisional committee to reassure European citizens about the quality of food on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the location of the Authority, I would stress once again that it is appropriate to locate it in an agricultural area with strong traditions, which is also a crossroads between Mediterranean and Continental Europe, which has a great and established agri-food tradition, and is the seat of a university and a centre of specialised agri-food research. We consider it out of the question, however, for the location of the Authority to become an object of barter between the Commission and any government, an affront to the citizens and to good sense.</p>

With such a host of alarming reports on food safety, it is imperative to protect Europe's people and our safety standards in food.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I support Mr Whitehead's proposal to include the word "safety" in the title of the body to read European Food Safety Authority. We must put safety first and make sure that harmful substances do not enter the food chain unseen by the back door.</p>

Of course, the health and well-being of our citizens is of paramount importance. We are calling for an Authority that has a clear and targeted remit to examine issues of food safety and is founded on the principles of transparency and meritocracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Labour MEPs have been at the forefront of protecting consumers across Europe. We have consistently backed proposals to ensure that food safety is strictly controlled within the EU. Mr Whitehead's report is yet further proof of Europe cleaning up its act and putting the safety of our citizens first.

We know the rest. BSE spread in Britain and has also appeared in other European countries, although to a lesser degree, claiming human victims and leading to the slaughter of a large but still unspecified number of cattle, with enormous damage to breeders and the livestock economy of the whole area. It is generally held that fodder based on animal meal has encouraged the spread of the livestock disease. The Commission’s proposal on the treatment of by-products of animal origin is a step in the right direction, but I agree with the rapporteur that we should strengthen the regulation by asking for strict separation, and hence visibility in the food chain, of the three categories of materials: extremely dangerous, for example contaminated by dioxins and transmissible spongiform encephalitis (TSE); carrying risk of diseases other than TSE; and produced from healthy animals. By-products in the first and second categories should be traceable through the use of dyes or odorants and should be prohibited. Only those in the third category are to be permitted as ingredients in animal fodder. The stricter the controls, the better it will be for the health of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the laudable amendments tabled by the rapporteur, whose efforts to strengthen the Commission’s proposals we appreciate, many points still remain unresolved in terms of decisions on urgent action in the event of crises. For this reason, I abstained in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all of our amendments were adopted, but the report makes a significant improvement on the Commission’s proposals in various ways.

<p class="contents">This battle must be fought on all fronts, because the consequences for children are disastrous, and from this point of view we support the argument that the possession of child-pornography material in itself constitutes an offence. The main problem is to avoid a situation in which this vital battle against the sexual exploitation of children and against child pornography is used by supporters of a reactionary morality, resulting in excesses tending to abolish freedoms, in particular in relation to certain material containing sexual information, or certain types of fiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore one cannot state than any representation of children showing ‘sexual behaviour’ is reprehensible. What concerns us is the ambiguity of a certain number of amendments dealing with virtual products. Perhaps this is a justifiable area for concern, but there is a real risk of going off the rails here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore in favour of a no-holds-barred campaign against the sexual exploitation of children and against child pornography, but a certain number of amendments involve a very real risk that this just campaign will be used for reactionary purposes.

I give my unqualified support to that part of the proposals in the Karamanou report. Unfortunately, in certain other proposals and in the debate in this connection, I have detected a nineteenth-century, Victorian undertone. I get the impression that a number of people who advocate tough measures would, in fact, ideally ban same-sex marriages, nudist beaches, pornographic images and text, sex outside marriage and <span class="italic">Manneken Pis</span>. I also get the feeling that they want to criminalise parents who, they believe, do not raise their children in a sufficiently prudish manner. You are already committing an offence if you give your children sex education, if other people can see your children naked or if the children can see their parents naked. That is not how you deal with the irresponsible, the profiteers and the criminals; instead you take away newly acquired freedom from ordinary well-meaning people.

It should not surprise you, Mr President, that with me the future can become the past. Well, in 2010 I was in a Chinese restaurant and I had a very good meal. It was so good that I got friendly with the owner and asked him about his life. ‘So you were a Member of the European Parliament?’ he said. ‘You did well to vote for the report against trafficking in human beings! Because, you see, I would have had to work with no social security, no wages, no pension, because I would have come to Strasbourg the wrong way. As it is, I have been able to earn a good salary. I also have a pension, and now I devote myself to this restaurant.

In effect, the Commission, which is frequently accused of using its new powers of initiative, which it derives from the Treaty of Amsterdam, in a way that is too favourable towards immigration (in particular the proposals on reuniting families and on temporary protection), is seeking to clear its name by including, under the heading of trafficking in human beings, trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation. It claims that this is a contribution to the campaign to halt illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, however, this is an alibi. If we examine the text more closely, we can see that the approach favoured by the Commission is to defuse the repressive measures. The offence of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation, as described in Article 1, does not require the illegal crossing of a border, and yet that is precisely the primary criterion in a case of illegal immigration. The result is that this offence is defined in a vague manner, so that it can cover very different types of cases, and not just illegal immigration. Under the pretext of this broad definition, the person who is the object of the trafficking is presented, in the Commission’s explanatory statement, as a ‘victim’. Therefore, in order for an offence to have been committed, that victim must have suffered a constraint, which does not correspond to the case of illegal immigrants, who generally come voluntarily.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, these supposed provisions against illegal immigration, buried as they are in the campaign against exploitation of all kinds, including child pornography, cannot possibly be effective. They serve merely to provide a <span class="italic">trompe-l’oeil</span> counterpart to other texts on immigration which are extremely lax.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, Member States, and in particular France, have used the powers of initiative which they still posses, until 1 May 2004, to put forward other proposals which are more precise, better targeted, and therefore more effective. There is a proposed framework decision aimed at reinforcing the penal code to stop the facilitation of unauthorised entry into and residence in the Union, a draft directive which seeks to improve the definition of ‘facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence’, and a draft directive on hauliers’ liability if they carry illegal immigrants. If Member States had not taken these initiatives in order to restore the balance, the texts currently being proposed by the Commission would be more or less pointless, at least as far as illegal immigration is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the best way in which to study and address these two serious problems. As a matter of fact, the UN treats them quite separately and rightly so, taking account of their quite different realities and of the different and separate approaches that they require.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report improves the Commission’s proposal considerably, and tables around fifty amendments, specifically indicating that trafficking in human beings must not just be punished, but that it must be expressly classified as a criminal activity. The report also proposes increasing prison sentences and takes the view that the instigation of, aiding or abetting such activity must also be punished.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important proposal is to set up a compensation fund for victims of trafficking in human beings, which would be funded from the confiscation of<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>criminals’ proceeds from crime. I think it is also positive that the report reiterates the need to give adequate protection to victims and witnesses, to grant the victims of trafficking temporary rights of residence for the entire period of criminal investigation or trial, including providing adequate accommodation and other support, specifically for reintegration, and the creation of a database of missing persons.</p>

A growing number of people in the richest countries attaches more importance to earning as much money as possible than to the well-being of their fellow men and the protection of the environment. This brings out the worst in people. Although colonial slavery was abolished 140 years ago, new forms of slavery are now emerging rapidly. Many women and children from Eastern Europe and the Third World, in search of a better life, fall into the hands of new slave drivers during their journey to richer countries. These seek to make money by forcing others into providing involuntary sexual services. Tough measures are needed, not to punish the victims, but to make it impossible for the profiteers to continue in their criminal activities. I welcome the fact that the proposal draws a distinction between the granting of humanitarian aid to people without the required paperwork and trafficking in human beings, that a compensation fund will be set up for victims, which is to be financed from confiscated, illegal profits, and that victims and witnesses are to be protected. I can therefore support the basic ideas of the Klamt report, although I share Mrs Sörensen’s concern that, with this proposal too, the Mafiosi, which have a genuine vested interest in this kind of activity, will continue to remain too much out of range. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must vote in favour because they must progress, they must have their televisions, cinemas and telephones too’. In fact I have voted in favour.

<p class="contents">In many of the poorer countries, the majority of the population not only do not have electricity, they are not even fed properly. It is easier to draw up and adopt resolutions of this kind, and even to grant a few subsidies allowing computer manufacturers to dispose of unsaleable stocks, than to feed the people of these countries or, even better, to give them the opportunity to feed themselves, instead of exploiting them and forcing them to abandon even their own food crops in order to produce for western markets.</p>
<p class="contents">It takes a great lack of awareness or a high degree of cynicism to state that ‘information and communication technologies afford possibilities of making a major contribution to direct democracy’. In some of the poorer countries, particularly in Africa, the people would be happy if the major European powers would make a ‘contribution’ to democracy by ceasing to support, finance and arm their dictators. However, it would be asking too much to expect the governments of Europe to abandon the long-standing dictatorships which protect the interests of their trusts.</p>

When will we see Michelangelo’s Moses in Strasbourg? And when will we see Van Gogh and Renoir in Spain? They have never been shown in our museums.’ ‘Very soon,’ I replied, ‘because, as well as legislating on the theft of works of art, the European Union will surely also ensure that these works can circulate freely and easily throughout Europe.’</p>
