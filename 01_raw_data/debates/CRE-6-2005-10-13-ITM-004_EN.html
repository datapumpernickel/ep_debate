<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Chmielewski, and the Committee on Fisheries for the report on the Commission’s proposal for technical measures in the Baltic Sea. I must express my gratitude for the open attitude taken by the committee and the rapporteur, in particular to the arguments put forward by the Commission, resulting in a report which the Commission can accept almost in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very technical file and, as you are aware, technical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea presently originate in large part from fisheries rules adopted at international level in the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Committee – IBSFC. The Community has adopted some additional rules for its own waters, which now cover all of the Baltic Sea except for the two small portions of Russian waters.</p>
<p class="contents">In Community legislation, the measures are spread out in three different Council regulations: the Baltic technical measures regulation, the regulation on industrial fishing for herring – both from 1998 – and the annual TAC and quota regulation, which also contains a number of technical conservation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this legal complexity, the present rules are, in some cases, over-complicated and, in others, unclear and remain open to interpretation. They are therefore difficult to implement and to control. On 14 March 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a new regulation on technical conservation measures for the Baltic Sea. The proposal was drafted after extensive consultation with the Baltic stakeholders and the Member States during 2004. It groups together all the relevant rules into a single legislative act, which will improve legal consistency. Furthermore, the proposal seeks to simplify and to streamline the rules as far as possible by, for example, proposing uniform closed seasons for certain species instead of having differing time periods in different parts of the Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation held within the Committee on Fisheries was characterised by a spirit of good cooperation, which has led to a strong result. The Commission’s proposal is very technical with many details relating to the construction and use of fishing gear in the Baltic. I am very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries have been able to address the very technical elements of the proposal and have come forward with a number of amendments which will improve the proposal. Amendments 5 and 6 are a good example of this. Strict rules were proposed for all the nets comprising the trawl to guarantee its efficient selectivity. These amendments allow the reduction of the application of the strict rules to the rear part of the trawl. Thus, the selectivity of the fishing gear is not affected. The rules have been simplified and are easier to understand for the fishermen, and control at sea is facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">I can support all but one of the 15 amendments proposed in the report. The only amendment on which I have reservations is Amendment 3. If we accept that fisheries inspectors can only take samples of a landing if the sample has been accepted by the ship owner, we may undermine the inspectors’ ability to carry out the necessary controls. Furthermore, I must remind you that it is always up to the inspectors to prove that the samples they have taken are representative of the landing. Therefore, I am not in a position to support the adoption of Amendment 3.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendment 9, on the introduction of an assessment of the effects of driftnets and other entangling gears on the sea mammal populations. However, let me make it clear that I am not prepared to accept the modification of the phasing-out of driftnets, as already adopted by the Council with Parliament’s support, in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by once again thanking the rapporteur and the committee for their excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zdzisław Kazimierz Chmielewski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(PL)</span> Madam President, my report concerns the proposal for a Council regulation on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea dated 14 March 2005. This regulation is one of a long list of Union documents aimed on the one hand at codifying existing solutions and on the other at extending their application to include the 10 new Member States, four of which are on the Baltic, as is well known. It should be noted at the outset that not everything in the Council’s proposal was to the liking of the aforementioned four countries. Many key articles were rejected outright.</p>
<p class="contents">As a rapporteur who is a national of one of those countries I found myself in an inordinately difficult position. In fact my country is one of those likely to be affected most by the new directive. I had to find a way through this political maze, which was no easy task. As usually happens, I was challenged to find an advantageous compromise, which was particularly difficult in this case as it involved technical fishing measures which are not particularly amenable to efforts at mediation. Whatever the underlying political intentions, there are other factors that impinge on fishing techniques, notably verification by those involved at a practical level, namely fishermen, and the fish themselves, that are quite oblivious to efforts at political mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately it proved possible to reduce the controversial issues to just a couple of crucial ones. Thanks are due to the Members involved and to the representatives of the European Commission for the efforts made in this regard. Most importantly, they succeeded in finding a compromise concerning the issue of cod fishing gear. Cod is the most important fish in the Baltic and the main source of income for those who fish in that sea. In addition to the exit window for juveniles recommended in the Council’s proposal and known as the BAKOMA – and I know this is just a detail – the Committee on Fisheries and the European Commission agreed to the use of the cheaper tried and tested T90 codend. This is equivalent as far as quality is concerned. It was a Polish and German idea.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of face to face working meetings with the authors of the proposal, the obvious weaknesses of the latter were remedied by the inclusion of essential definitions of items of fishing gear referred to in several articles. The most important of these definitions concerned the extension piece, which is mentioned frequently in the regulation. Thanks to the efforts made, many concerns were allayed and the controversial restrictions in a number of provisions were toned down. The flexible nature of certain articles also became clearer. As a result, the rapporteur was able to withdraw Amendment 16 and scale down five other amendments concerning in particular the restrictive Article 6, to which the Commissioner has already referred. This article is a source of worry for the entire fishing sector in the Baltic, calling as it does for a ban on items of fishing gear used on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also the problem of salmon driftnets, which gave rise to the strongest feelings in the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries. The Polish fishing sector is of the opinion that the rest of Europe believes driftnets represent a serious threat to marine mammals, particularly porpoises, if these nets are used for salmon fishing. In the southern Baltic, however, these nets do not represent a threat because porpoises are extremely rare there. It is also the case that a decision to ban such nets in this part of the Baltic would prevent some 60 Polish ship owners from fishing for salmon.</p>
<p class="contents">Aware of both aspects of the problem posed by these nets, on the one hand the Union’s requirements concerning protection of resources in the Baltic, and on the other salmon fishermen’s livelihoods and their futures, the rapporteur suggested the only possible compromise solution in this situation. This was to take account of the Council’s recommendations whilst at the same time undertaking reliable studies of the Baltic waters. The study should establish the true state of affairs and evaluate the actual impact of the use of these nets and other entangling gear on marine mammals. Completion is set for 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Here ends the tale of my report. I was challenged to move mountains, and like all parliamentary compromises, it meets the conditions for acceptance by the House even if it does not please everyone all of the time, Polish fishermen in particular. Our compromise does meet the aforementioned conditions, and the Committee on Fisheries eventually agreed on it unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already thanked the Members responsible, the rest of the Committee on Fisheries and the European Commission’s experts. I should also like to thank all other experts, researchers and fishing gear manufacturers from the Baltic countries who gave their time voluntarily to help the rapporteur become familiar with this very important aspect of fishing activity which is also challenging as it requires specialist knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to stress that in contrast to nets used in other areas, these nets do not represent a serious threat to the biodiversity of marine life. In addition, there is no scientific evidence that they represent a serious threat to porpoises in the central and northern areas of the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Banning driftnets in the Baltic would effectively mean the end of Polish salmon fishing, as there are no alternative nets that could be used in our waters. There was no scientific justification for the decision taken and no account was taken of the position of the countries concerned. These countries did not become Members of the Union until 1 May 2004, and the decision was taken a mere four days before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons we feel that the compromise solution would be the best way forward. It would involve postponing further bans on nets in the Baltic for three years, until appropriate scientific data is available to justify the need for such measures or deem them unnecessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Debates on proposals from the Commission that might lead, in the long or short term, to restrictions being placed on fishing activity, are always heated, and that on this proposal has been no exception. It might not be evident from the outcome of the vote in Committee, but there were a number of points on which a compromise could be reached only after in-depth discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would like especially to draw attention to Article 12 of the Commission proposal, which deals with restrictions on, and the prohibition of, driftnets. Our group has previously endorsed all attempts to provide for a reduction in the use of these devices or a ban on them, and so it necessarily follows that the same strict rules should apply in the Baltic as in other European Union fishing grounds, in which driftnets have for years been banned in order to give small cetaceans a better chance of survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain efforts are being made to jeopardise the current ban on driftnets, and these our group repudiates. Day-to-day practice shows, however, that a valid legal framework will only be any good in so far as it is capable of being monitored, simply and effectively, on the ground, in other words, in practice. This, I think, is where the main difficulties lie, and I hope that this legal framework will result in a more vigorous approach to monitoring in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have waited for a long time for driftnets also to be banned in the Baltic Sea, the last sea in the EU where these are still permitted. Thank you for sticking to that view, even if there is sometimes criticism of this ban here in the European Parliament. I wish to take the opportunity of thanking our rapporteur for his willingness to compromise on this issue too. It was also wrong of the Council not to involve the new Member States in this process from the beginning. It might have facilitated the process if they had been involved at the first stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we can wait until the last porpoise is dead before we finally establish the scientific proofs, for then it will be too late. We have seen studies showing the risks involved in driftnets, and I think that the studies no doubt justify applying the precautionary principle in this case. The biological diversity of the Baltic Sea is very vulnerable. It is an extremely sensitive sea, and we should not risk disturbing the balance there.</p>
<p class="contents">I now await your next initiative. A year ago, we discussed the opportunities available to countries that, with a view to improving future generations’ potential catches, wish voluntarily to call a halt to fishing and to introduce compensation for fishermen. I await rules from the Commission whereby countries that, with a view to future profits, wish to increase the quantity of fish in their waters, are enabled more easily to call a voluntary halt to fishing. I hope that we can discuss this in more detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has inflicted incredible damage on the ecology of the North Sea and has done absolutely nothing for conservation. Not satisfied with this disaster, the EU is actually encouraging its repetition in African coastal waters. You can therefore imagine the cynicism with which I read this proposal for special technical measures to improve the conservation situation in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has produced an extraordinarily unhelpful explanatory statement, which is really little more than a blow-by-painful-blow account of a paper trail. At the end there is a complicated appendix which seeks to lay down the law on the specifications for codends and even the exact size and shape of codend buoys. Why this House should be preoccupying itself with such minutiae is beyond me, unless it is yet another symptom of the European Union’s limitless propensity for control-freakism. Doubtless these technical specifications will have been dreamt up by bureaucrats without the slightest experience of sea fishing and will therefore cause enormous problems for the people who have to have such experience and work on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the EU has any business in involving itself in conservation in the Baltic, or anywhere else for that matter. These issues should be resolved by sensible negotiation between national government and fishermen, not by an unelected bureaucracy with an absolutely appalling track record for environmental vandalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has worked hard to take account of the interests of the four former Baltic partners and also of the interests of the four new Member States that joined at the latest enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that the proposal for a Council regulation that is the subject of Mr Chmielewski’s report codifies provisions drafted prior to 2004, that is to say, prior to the accession of the 10 new Member States to the Union. At the time, the possibilities for other interested European countries to be involved in the talks were strictly limited, and Parliament’s new elected representatives were of course unable to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the specific nature of the natural environment of the Baltic, and of the significant differences between its western and eastern waters, input by the new countries to the report before us needed to be taken into account and I trust this was the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur once again. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He made reference to the fact that he had been faced with a very difficult challenge and needed to find a workable compromise. The end result is very much a workable compromise, and the Commission is prepared to accept all the amendments except the one I have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that the breakthrough came with the acceptance of the T90 codend, which could be used as an alternative to the BACOMA trawl. I confirm that ISIS advises that the T90 codend has the same selectivity as the BACOMA exit window and we can therefore accept its use.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to driftnets, we accept the study which can indicate what remedial measures can be taken which would be of a socio-economic nature. However, the Commission has no intention of considering an extension of the phasing-out of driftnets with regard to the Baltic, simply because of the fact that the driftnets ban has already been in place with the regulation of 1998 and the extension and phasing-out up to 2010 for the Baltic was already a special concession and it does not make sense to grant any further extension or concession, otherwise we risk opening up again the whole argument with regard to driftnets and place in doubt the validity of such driftnets in the other Community waters. It is true that the number of porpoises is very low. This, however, makes it even more important to continue to uphold the ban to ensure that no irreparable damage occurs with regard to porpoises. The low populations of porpoises put even more responsibility on us to ensure their protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is a general driftnet ban, which is part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, as I mentioned before, and we must ensure that this is in no way prejudiced.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I should like to thank Mr Kindermann and Mr Schlyter for their support. With regard to the point made by Mr Schlyter concerning the closed season for cod, it must be said that the closure and the closed areas for cod and the closed season for cod is not a voluntary measure. It is a mandatory measure, which was introduced together with the TACs and quotas regulation at the December Council. However, at the moment we are preparing a recovery plan for cod in the Baltic Sea and it is obvious that technical measures and measures relating to closed areas and closed seasons will form an integral part of this recovery plan. It is also obvious that if fishermen are constrained to tie up as a result of such closed seasons, then, under normal Community rules, they would be entitled to compensation for that tie-up if it is considered to be of an exceptional nature or is a result of the measures of a recovery plan.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what Mr Titford said, I can only say that I cannot agree with him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
