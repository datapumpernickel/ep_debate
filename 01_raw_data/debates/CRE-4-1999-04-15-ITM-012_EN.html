<p class="contents">But this important issue is not just about the proper functioning of the internal market or the distribution of resources between the Member States and the Community. We are concerned with combating international fraud and organised crime as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the four‐year delay in finalising computerisation is very worrying, because it comes on top of other delays, which can be ascribed fundamentally to the intergovernmental nature of the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we are forced to recognise that Parliament"s ambitious aim has met with opposition from the Member States, some of which insist on rejecting the logical consequences of the advent of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, everyone would gain from optimising the Commission's action, which would allow us to rationalise the instruments and resources involved. From this point of view, I firmly support their incorporation into a single decision‐making centre and a single budget line.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as the rapporteur says, it is imperative for the computerisation of Community transit to come into full operation by 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">So on that basis, I shall vote for the proposal for a decision as amended.</p>

<p class="contents">1. Customs services are a fundamental part of the legal system of a country. Direction of customs administrations by the EU would violate national sovereignty and must never be allowed to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Previous EU decisions have weakened border controls between the Member States in such a way as to encourage lawbreaking and the movement of smuggled goods. This demonstrates the importance of making nationally based appraisals of the strength of customs authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The report is an insult to the Member States, since it seeks to establish practices which have been rejected by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">4. It is perfectly feasible for cooperation between customs administrations in different countries to be organised on an intergovernmental basis.</p>

I want to back that conviction with three arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">First, like Rijk van Dam, I do not think that the existing infrastructures in many EU countries are ready to cope with such an increase in loads. The result would be major additional highway maintenance costs, which local communities would have to bear, while all they would get in return would be a few jobs. The weakness of our infrastructures is very real and risks deteriorating with enlargement. We know that the cost of enlargement will have to include the modernisation of transport links.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I reject the proposal on road safety grounds, even at the risk of shocking certain professionals in the field. The involvement of heavy goods vehicles in the most lethal accidents is undeniable, because, in addition to excessively difficult working conditions, weight is also an aggravating factor, all the more so as it is often combined with excessive speed. Allowing heavy goods vehicles of up to 44 tonnes on the roads would actually increase the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, if such vehicles are authorised, emissions of pollutants will be increased because extra power will be needed to pull these trailers. That contradicts the express wishes of both our governments and Parliament in terms of environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, those are the reasons for my hostility towards this authorisation and why I voted against the Commission"s proposals.</p>

Examples of these disadvantages are that an agreement with a brewery could no longer consist of the brewery financing the establishment of a restaurant or public house, subject to the proprietor signing a ten‐year supply contract. This, I believe, is a blow to people starting up in the licensed trade and to the trade itself, because these supply arrangements have been standard practice and have served as a stepping‐stone to success.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the oil industry, which builds service stations and at the same time concludes supply agreements with the service station operators for ten years or more. On the basis of this report, all such arrangements will become more difficult or impossible in future. That is why I voted against it. I believe it is inconsistent with our aim of promoting business start‐ups and the creation of jobs.</p>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, Commissioner van den Broek, who is not himself responsible for competition policy, could only read out what the Commission services, or more precisely Mr Van Miert's department, had written for him. I must therefore strongly warn the Commission against rejecting our Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 to both of the draft regulations. These amendments are a sign of our political will to ensure that small breweries such as those in my country are not driven to the wall because they are no longer allowed to conclude the sort of supply contracts that exist at the present time. These contracts have been operating to the satisfaction of the breweries on the one hand and of landlords, restaurateurs and hoteliers on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">For this sector, as for service stations, there must be either an exception to the general rule or a sector‐by‐sector approach within the general regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable that in smaller markets, such as the Luxembourg market, breweries exceeding a market share of, say, 40 % would be ineligible for such exemptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Luxembourg breweries can quickly reach that sort of threshold in our small market, such a rule would lead to the crazy situation in which a major German brewery, such as Bitburger, which produces vastly greater quantities of beer than the largest brewery in Luxembourg, could still conclude contracts for the supply of beer to public houses in Luxembourg, because the total amount it supplied would be well within the limit of 40 % of the huge German beer market to which Bitburger would be subject. The Luxembourg brewery, however, could no longer do that, which would spell the end for it. That must be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">If there must be reference markets, they cannot be restricted to mini‐markets such as Luxembourg but must be defined on a regional or European scale. I hope that the Commission, and Mr Van Miert in particular, will rethink this matter very thoroughly.</p>

We in the EU have entered into trade agreements with China and other countries on garlic imports, and the motion will be detrimental to our trading partners in third countries.

In reality, as a little hindsight makes clear, that was just empty posturing to get people to accept a monetary system with very little democracy to recommend it.</p>
<p class="contents">This second part, which the European Parliament has just voted on today, is essentially about reforming the Commission. The timing is doubly bad. It is bad first of all because, as stated in the explanatory statement, it concentrates on the aim of reinforcing the independence of the Commission, when recent experience, with the resignation of that institution for maladministration, suggests that, on the contrary, its independence should be reduced and the controls over it strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The timing of the report is also bad because, by definition, it is only proposing reforms that can be implemented without modifying the Treaty, whereas Chancellor Schröder explained to us yesterday that there can be no remedy for the crisis unless the Treaty is modified. That is certainly our opinion and we were happy to hear that the new intergovernmental conference, to be launched at the Cologne Council in June, will have that mission included in its mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">There will clearly be different views about the necessary reforms. The view of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is that the first thing to do is to stop thinking of the Commission as a superior body, as the guardian of the European public interest. It must become merely the executive arm of the Council. We must also stop manufacturing a European civil service cut off from the nations and virtually endogamous, both literally and figuratively. It should be much more open to national civil services and should be based on exchanges of personnel with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That kind of permanent interaction will be very fruitful in bringing Europe closer to the people. We must stop thinking that the European public interest is something imposed on the nations from on high. On the contrary, it is the result of the free expression of their needs and open dialogue between their representatives.</p>

In a way, this text represents the balance not dealt with earlier, either in the first report or in the reports by Mr Brok, Mrs Lööw and Mr Bourlanges.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the European Parliament, I support the rapporteur in asking for our work to concentrate on the essential tasks, for greater professionalism on the part of Members and for improved information to the public. We should pay particular attention to this last point. Improving the way we welcome visitors, who will be coming in increasing numbers, and improving access to documents are two measures that speak for themselves. I especially like the idea of an open centre, easily accessible and without security controls, where those interested would find documents, audio‐visual materials, CD‐ROMS, and so on. Perhaps an extension of the <span class="italic">Bureau pour la Belgique</span> could be envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope a formula can be found whereby the people of the <span class="italic">Quartier Léopold</span> , who are fighting to prevent their environment becoming a bureaucratic desert, can have a special relationship with Parliament and feel at home. It will be a big step forward when the area between Parliament and the station, the famous ‘<span class="italic">dalle</span> ", is finally landscaped in a more welcoming and friendly way. That means releasing the necessary resources, which will require closer cooperation between the <span class="italic">Espace Léopold</span> society, Parliament – in its moral role – and the relevant Belgian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, I told a journalist that I was astonished not to see more of his colleagues covering Parliament"s important work. He replied that they go where the power is – the Council first and foremost. Fortunately, the Treaty of Amsterdam, which enters into force on 1 May, will increase our power a little, notably as regards the investiture of the Commission. I hope that we will become more visible. But it is up to us to become more transparent.</p>

Despite some progress, the Treaty of Amsterdam has basically failed to come up to the expectations of all those who hoped that the European Union was something other than a huge market.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right to emphasise, in line with the Commission, that another intergovernmental conference is necessary and urgent to provide acceptable solutions to the various institutional problems which have existed for a fair number of years now.</p>
<p class="contents">But we cannot stand idly by, waiting for another IGC to start. Events remind us every day of the political holes in the construction of Europe and the Union"s inability to tackle alone most of the great challenges it faces. So, as of now, we must make maximum use of the opportunities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam to deepen European integration and reform the Union"s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present context, I want to stress that, whichever way you look at it, the workforce has hardly expanded in terms of a European civil service – I am referring in particular to the Commission – and has not followed the exponential curve of the tasks that have been entrusted to it since the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, it is worth thinking about the role of the Council and its pursuit of objectives that are sometimes contradictory. At the same time, there are grounds for concern about the possible harmful consequences of widespread use by the Commission of temporary staff seconded from national civil services or from industry. I am in no way casting doubt on the competence of these temporary workers, or suggesting that they may not be good Europeans. And I can appreciate the desire for flexibility and acquiring new methods and skills. But, like our rapporteur, I am afraid that there might be conflicts of loyalty between the vital independence of the Commission and national and sectoral interests which may lead to ambiguity in terms of a worker"s status.</p>

It is time for a clear‐out. Too much has been allowed to go on for too long. This applies to the blurring of the lines of responsibility within the Commission, an out‐of‐date staff policy and a European Parliament which was not taken seriously because it was lacking in real power. At present, the public's confidence in the EU is at a low ebb. That is logical in the wake of recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate which we are about to have should, in my view, be used constructively to improve the cooperation between the institutions. And there is a great deal that can be improved. We shall insist on the staff policy being one of the key priorities in the clear‐out. But I must emphasise that interest also needs to be shown by the Council in order to carry this through. If we can get the cooperation between our institutions to function properly, then the public will also gain greater confidence in us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty gives the European Parliament the opportunity to acquire greater supervisory powers than it has had in the past. This will find expression in relation to the environment, amongst other areas. But not within agriculture. This is unfortunate, because what is it that makes it unnecessary to monitor agriculture, especially when one considers that more than 40 % of the budget is spent on it? We must insist that the European Parliament's stance on agricultural matters is taken more seriously. If control is not exercised by Parliament, then there is no control. The events of last month have set an extremely important process in motion, which will reinforce the cooperation between the institutions. Through the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament is acquiring even more influence. We must now also be even better at using that influence.</p>

<p class="contents">The report by the Committee of Independent Experts on shortcomings in the way the Commission operates reaches two main conclusions: there is too much power and too little supervision. Space could have been found in this report to address that state of affairs, without departing from the original remit. Too much power, poor levels of supervision and transparency, the absence of an inventory of documents received – these are some of the deficiencies in the EU institutions today, and this is especially true from the perspective of the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council"s deliberations on new legislation – legal texts – should be accessible to the public, as is the case with legislation before national parliaments. Both the Commission"s proposals and the Council"s decisions should be public and available to all.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element in the necessary reform process is greater decentralisation, with the EU concentrating on major issues and liberating itself from a welter of detailed business. We also need increased cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments; together, they could jointly exercise a greater degree of supervision. This is a dimension that should have been dealt with more extensively in the report.</p>

It was Parliament that raised the alarm in 1996 by setting up a temporary committee of inquiry which revealed the deficiencies in the way the Commission and certain Member States were handling the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has been made since then, as the report we are voting on today shows. Like the rapporteurs, I am glad the Commission has implemented most of the European Parliament"s recommendations. The transformation of the scientific committees represents very significant progress. In fact, the experts are guaranteed increased independence and greater transparency in their work. Moreover, the European Commission and the Food and Veterinary Office have markedly improved the effectiveness of the inspections and controls. The initiation of infringement proceedings against Member States for inadequate application or non‐application of Community legislation has accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">So there has been real progress, and that message must be loud and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">But we cannot start celebrating yet. The disease has far from disappeared, as shown by the increase in cases in Portugal. And we must not lose sight of the fact that there is a long incubation period for CJD. So caution is essential. Parliament must continue to monitor the situation and put pressure on the European Commission. There are still differences, as mentioned in the report by Mr Böge and Mrs Roth‐Behrendt, and they mainly relate to the two key elements of the right to compensation and sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must shoulder their responsibilities. It is absolutely intolerable to find that some of them have refused to cooperate with European Commission staff. It is all the more unacceptable because human lives are at risk. The precautionary principle must be applied everywhere because it is one of the most effective ways of protecting consumers. This concerns each and every one of us. Analysis of this report shows that the crisis goes beyond the BSE issue. Everything comes back to the institutional crisis we have just experienced, with the resignation of the European Commission. In fact, the various reports by the temporary committees of inquiry underlined not only the Commission"s lack of transparency and coordination, but also the shortage of human resources. These deficiencies were further highlighted in the report by the Group of Independent Experts which led to the present situation. All this must be brought to an end at the next IGC and we must no longer shrink from reforms which are indispensable to the smooth running of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">While the BSE crisis has certainly made it possible to change decision‐making procedures within the Commission, my group wants those procedures to go further than the mad cow affair, so that the precautionary principle is managed as well as possible and so that the scientific committees cannot be subjected to political or economic pressure through the Commission"s experts.</p>
<p class="contents">European breeders have made remarkable efforts to improve product traceability and restore consumer confidence in the quality of the products they eat. Our farmers simply cannot understand why imports from third countries of genetically modified agricultural products to be used for animal feed are allowed, when we are unsure of the long‐term effects of GMOs on the quality of meat. Why has the Commission accepted imports of genetically modified maize or soya?</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is threatening the European Union with a WTO panel on 13 May because we refuse to import meat treated with hormones. What position will the European Union take in the WTO negotiations due to start at the end of this year? Personally, listening to Mr Prodi, I am worried. He seems more concerned about signing up to the Commission"s traditional power bulimia, than about clarifying how the Commission will apply the precautionary principle and the principle of fair trade – on which the next President of the Commission is silent – when it represent the interests of the Member States in those crucial trade negotiations. The European Union must approach these negotiations with real determination to defend the precautionary principle and the social, environmental and animal welfare standards necessary for healthy and lasting trade which respects all our economies and all our consumers.</p>

It is the largest and most populous of the applicant countries and expressed its legitimate wish to join the European Union in 1994, although negotiations did not really begin until four years later.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, and especially since 1997, when parliamentary elections were held and the new constitution came into force, Poland has demonstrated its commitment to reform. The government has constantly expressed, in word and deed, its intention to create the conditions for membership of the European Union in its country by 2002. It is on the right path and that is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, the country satisfies the criteria for a democratic state. Its institutions are solidly established and guarantee the rule of law, respect for human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. That is an essential factor, but it has to be combined with other criteria, notably the economic dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Economically, Poland has one of the strongest economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Its growth rate is over 5 %, inflation and unemployment are falling, and the budget deficit and government debt are in line with the Maastricht criteria. However, despite the positive economic trend and significant structural reforms – reform of the administration, the health service, the pension system – there are still backlogs to be compensated for in various areas: the internal market, the lack of a system to oversee state aid, and the privatisation of the major public companies. Agriculture and the environment present particular problems and thorough reforms are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hoff advocates global structural change. I support the idea that agriculture should be seen as part of a rural development strategy. The changes should create jobs and respect the environment and to achieve this, Poland must increase investment in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making demands on the Polish people, but we also have duties towards them. The restructuring that must precede membership has a social cost which we must bear in mind. The European Community must ensure that accompanying measures minimise the impact of these reforms on people"s living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end on a positive note, by reaffirming my view that it is perfectly natural for Poland to join the European Union, just as it was natural for it to join NATO last month.</p>

The present environmental problems in the applicant countries are a result of high emissions into the atmosphere from industrial activities, energy production and traffic as well as under‐funding and neglect of water and waste management. To prevent the present Member States being affected by this, environmental issues must play an important role in preparing the Central and Eastern European countries for membership of the Union. Before joining they must be able to demonstrate that they are able to abide by both EU environmental legislation and international treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also ensure that it does not encourage the further decimation of the large expanses of untouched environmental beauty in the applicant countries. Whilst funding should of course be made available to modernise and attract industry to this region, it should not be at the expense of the environment of either applicant or present Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there shall be environmental benefits as a result of a successful application by these countries. The large areas of sparsely populated land so characteristic of many of these nations shall undoubtedly bring new areas of environmental beauty and diversity into the Union and these should be promoted and developed through financial assistance from the EU.

I think the Ombudsman has recognised the importance of his role in a European Union that hopes to move closer to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">How can European citizenship be envisaged if the Community institutions can act in a discretionary or even arbitrary way towards the people they administer and not be held to account? That unacceptable situation only ended in 1995 with the appointment of the European Ombudsman. At last the complaints from European citizens about maladministration by the Community institutions would be heard. At last there would be a minimum of dialogue and transparency in the functioning of what is often regarded as the ‘Brussels bureaucracy".</p>
<p class="contents">Successive annual reports, and especially the 1998 report, have illustrated the progress made. First, there has been progress as regards the amount of cases dealt with. The number of complaints is up by 200 on the previous year. This means that people are becoming more aware of the Ombudsman and no longer hesitate to express their concerns and indeed their anger. They want to make themselves heard and have their rights respected. And we must welcome that. But honesty and realism force me to put a damper on this. There are 370 million people in Europe and there were only 1 372 complaints in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need an information campaign. There is no lack of new forms of communication. On similar lines, I support the Ombudsman"s suggestion that all remedies open to individuals should be clearly mentioned in the EC Treaty, including the right to complain to their national ombudsmen. And here the excellent cooperation developed between the latter and the European Ombudsman should be highlighted. Cooperation is also a watchword of the relations between the European Parliament"s Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman. Their networking will definitely result in effectiveness. And this will all benefit the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">While the balance sheet is largely positive, improvements still need to be made, in particular as regards the status of the Ombudsman in terms of his investigative role. It really is vital for him to have access to all the relevant documents he needs, which is not the case today. The adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour for the European institutions would also provide a guarantee for the public, who would be able to consult it freely. More generally, what emerges from the European Ombudsman"s report is that the confidence of Europeans depends on transparency, dialogue and clear legal rules allowing them to defend their rights. These are the necessary conditions for developing a sense of belonging to a project which often seems remote.</p>

<p class="contents">One is pessimistic. As a recent news report saw it, the whole of the European civil service is stigmatised by the extent of malfunction that was disclosed. The other is optimistic. We can draw a positive conclusion from the growing number of complaints. It can be seen as proof that the public is taking a new interest in the construction of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This paradoxical approach – drawing a positive conclusion from a decidedly negative fact – must clearly not deter us from taking an interest in the cases of maladministration condemned by the Ombudsman and his response to appeals from the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone will agree that it is not enough for European citizens to recognise the increased role played by the European Union in their daily lives; they also need to experience it and analyse it as something positive.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am delighted to hear our rapporteur applaud the quality of the work done by the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency will also build lasting support on the part of the European public for European integration. That is why the rapporteur has my full support when she defends the general principle of access to all the documents needed to examine a case.

<p class="contents">There have been 6 500 petitions with 10 million signatures during this parliamentary term, which works out at an average of almost four petitions and 5 000 signatures every twenty‐four hours, including Sundays and holidays. Those figures surely make us wonder.</p>
<p class="contents">They are bound to make us ask questions, as elected representatives, about the real nature of our relations and the relations of the European institutions with the public.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that, apart from the specific questions it raises about the relationship between the elected and the electors as this century draws to a close, the right of petition is one of the best ways for Parliament to exercise control over the Commission and the Council – as well as the Member States – on behalf of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of petition is therefore one way to make our fellow citizens more firmly and deeply attached to the construction of Europe.

I congratulate her on that, just as I congratulate her on having established that the measures suggested by the Commission should not make transport more expensive, but should permit more effective use of infrastructures and greater respect for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">But I want to add ‘safer use" to that ‘effective use", thinking of the current increase in the number of road and rail tunnels and the serious accidents that have occurred in the last few years. The accident in the Channel Tunnel – where there is a modern alarm system – could have caused heavy loss of life. It was pure chance that the burning carriage stopped near an access door to the second tunnel, so the people were able to escape. The Mont Blanc accident has cost the lives of forty people and nobody knows when the tunnel will be open to traffic again.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take on board all the conclusions of the inquiries in progress and take the necessary decisions. But I feel that one principle should be adopted right away, covering all safety aspects in tunnels. The service responsible for safety must be genuinely independent of the company operating the tunnel and the company must apply all the recommendations made by the safety service. This principle will have financial implications, but safety, in other words, the lives of those who use the tunnels, naturally comes at a price. In the final analysis, perhaps the authority to control safety should be exclusively a matter for the government.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final comment. Of the 35 million tonnes of goods that travel between Italy and France each year, 10 million tonnes are carried by rail. The Chamonix valley is a notorious HGV corridor with traffic growing exponentially, along with the nuisance and the risks this entails. That is the measure of the absurdity of an ‘all by road" policy based on profit at any price. I have therefore paid tribute to the courage of the rapporteur who, despite the infrastructure costs, firmly stresses the advantages of the rail alternative in terms of safety and the environment.</p>

<p class="contents">And, to be perfectly honest, even I have to recognise that the White Paper provides some interesting food for thought.</p>
<p class="contents">I too am all for fair competition between individual modes of transport and for fair and efficient pricing of transport services. I too am in favour of shifting more transport operations from the roads to the railways and waterways, but I am opposed to making cars, lorries and buses the sole scapegoats for every possible problem and even for some impossible ones. And that is the thrust of the White Paper and, I am sorry to say, of the parliamentary report as well.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of fair competition, we cannot ignore the fact that railway wages are higher and jobs are virtually guaranteed for life – conditions that will probably never obtain in the private sector. Given the present craze for liberalisation, are there plans to change this and, if so, in what way?</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper is talking facts when it says that external costs throughout the EU are assessed by the Commission at an annual figure of EUR 250 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">There is talk of marginal social cost, although we never quite discover precisely what is meant by that, of taxes on diesel and of uniform charging systems being introduced throughout Europe with the aid of electronic data transfer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the rapporteur goes too far when she calls for the inclusion of private non‐commercial vehicles in the charging system as a means of distributing the costs among all users of the road network. Is this designed to ensure that in future only the rich will be able to drive cars and that the bulk of the population will stay at home?</p>
<p class="contents">To the rapporteur's credit, however, she insists that the proposed measures must not result in more expensive transport and that, if price rises are inevitable, the burden on road users should be reduced in some other way.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it would have been interesting to learn from the Commission how much each Member State collects in road tax and in excise duty on petrol, diesel and so on, and how much of that is systematically ploughed back into the construction and maintenance of the road network.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if every possible and impossible means is already being used to master the perennially increasing volume of traffic, care must be taken to avoid burdening users and operators of rail, road, air and water transport with a procession of new taxes, and that is the bottom line.</p>
<p class="contents">We would do well to remember how great the outcry was in Germany when there was talk of increasing the price of a litre of petrol to the equivalent of 100 Belgian francs. I have the impression that the policy set out in the White Paper is designed to achieve that same objective by a different route.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs a good transport system and so does the business world, and at the end of the day, someone will always have to pay. And that someone just happens to be the citizen. I also note that the Commission is acting as though it were unaware that a great deal of environmental innovation has taken place in the field of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">European transport companies, whether they operate trains, road vehicles, aircraft or ships, are the most modern in the world. To keep burdening them with new taxes would drive them to the brink of unprofitability. At one of the hearings on the White Paper, I could scarcely believe my ears when one of the invited experts said we should have to think about taxing aviation fuel at four ecus per litre for the sake of the environment: Concorde prices as the everyday norm, but who is supposed to pay them?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be voting against Mrs Schmidbauer's report.</p>
