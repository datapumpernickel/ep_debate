<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, you and your colleagues achieved something extraordinary in starting from an extremely difficult situation just before Doha and nonetheless, by the end of the meeting, getting all the subjects wanted by the European Union into the programme for the round beginning in 2002, this despite the usual, and largely unjustified, attacks by India and the Cairns Group countries on the European Union. Essential elements of our pre-conference resolution were included. Two weeks later, in Accra, I saw for myself the pride of Ghana's government representatives in pointing out that Africa had played an independent role this time, and this could, among other things, be attributed to good preparatory work by the European Union and in particular by Commissioner Lamy.</p>
<p class="contents">The developing countries, particularly Africa, are now and for the future fully involved in negotiations, and this was also one of our main demands. The political declaration on TRIPS represents a respectable result for the African mediators, something that you have already mentioned this morning, Commissioner Lamy. The demands of the developing countries and of the Africans – ranging from the need for comprehensive technical aid to the Cotonou Agreement's exceptions up to 2008 – have very largely been met.</p>
<p class="contents">The core European demands will, though, also be included in the new round of negotiations. I do not need to go into the details again. What is important is that we in the European Union can input our conceptions of a socially and environmentally responsible market economy into the system of free and fair world trade and that they can also, slowly, prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, though, that there is still more that we can do to make the WTO more democratic. Mr Lamy, you too have referred to the need for us to achieve the creation of a parliamentary assembly. We in this Parliament should retain our leadership role and also ask the Commission to continue its financial support for us, so that we can especially involve the representatives of the African parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return to a point made in this morning's debate. One of our colleagues, Mrs Lucas, pointed out that the outcome was poor, indeed unacceptable. I thought, here comes a European justification of European interests, but she only referred to India and certain NGOs, which...</p>

<p class="contents">In Qatar, we saw a breakthrough. For the first time, and against fierce and widespread opposition, we will have negotiations on some key environmental issues. Of course, much more remains to be done, but a process has been started and a taboo broken. The key to further progress must be to demonstrate, above all, to developing countries that their fears of green protectionism on our side are groundless.</p>
<p class="contents">Qatar, frankly, did not produce the progress that we in the PSE Group wanted, and asked for beforehand on labour rights, on democracy and transparency in WTO decision-making. But it did leave the way open to progress on both. We know there was intense pressure from many countries, including developing countries, for a declaration that labour rights were a matter for the ILO alone. That pressure was resisted quite rightly and the principle of WTO cooperation with the ILO restated. The EU must now push hard to translate this principle into practice, seizing the opportunity given by the ILO's launch of a commission on the social aspects of globalisation in which the WTO and other international organisations will be participating.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministerial meeting also agreed to negotiations on reform of the dispute settlement procedure with an open agenda covering whatever proposals WTO members choose to table. The EU must take this opportunity for openness and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we would really like to know what your ideas are for reform and we shall not be slow in letting you know what our ideas are either.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to put on record today our recognition of the key role played by you, Commissioner Lamy, in the success of the meeting. You had a very difficult role and you displayed skill and tenacity. I emphasise, in particular, your insistence that you need the political support of this House in order to pursue the round in the way it was launched. We shall be marking our support in a resolution to be voted tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people went to Qatar hoping for a fiasco, hoping for a re-run of Seattle, hoping for something to denounce, in a mood of populism. They are disappointed in that hope and they need to be honest with themselves and to respect the views of developing countries not to indulge in paternalism as some of our colleagues have unfortunately done.</p>
<p class="contents">The Qatar Declaration contains almost everything that developing countries wanted on the agenda. The agenda is not the outcome and we will need to be vigilant for a good result, but when developing.<span class="italic">..</span>.</p>

It is true that in the coming years the 144 Member States will resume negotiations on the further liberalisation of world trade, but more than ever before, the rich man’s club has learnt that survival of the fittest no longer applies. Indeed, the developing countries have made huge progress and have made their mark during the negotiations. However, the European Union also has reason to be satisfied. Thanks to the commitment and perseverance of the European negotiators, both our Commissioners who are present today, an agreement has ultimately been reached on a broad-based negotiation round. For example, in the new round, there will be scope for negotiations about public spending, competition, investments, and the link between international environmental agreements and the WHO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">These trade discussions are held at a significant time, because after the acts of terrorism in the United States, they send out the message that the Member States are prepared to join forces at international level and that terrorists cannot undermine international trade. Furthermore, it is important to continue the liberal trade policy because it can give the failing world economy a shot in the arm.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the WTO’s challenge is to continue to develop the multi-lateral trade system in such a way as to ensure that globalisation yields the best possible benefits for as many people and countries as possible. We must continue to strive as we have for over fifty years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This creates the impression that popular movements should be just as deliriously happy as Mr Lamy about the result from Qatar. That is an unusually impudent lie. The truth is that the environmental and solidarity organisations are criticising the EU’s action in Doha and characterising the final agreement as a defeat for the poor peoples of the world. The International Forum on Globalisation observes, for example, that the results from Qatar signify ‘the ultimate triumph for the world trade body whose very mission is to exclude civil society from shaping economic systems’.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the Laeken Summit, ATTAC Belgium wrote that, partly because of its support for the WTO, the EU <span class="italic">est essentiellement déterminée par les intérêts des institutions financières et des grandes entreprises</span>. The truth is that both the European popular movements and representatives of the developing countries are very embittered about the EU negotiators’ way of using the language of force to twist the arms of the poor countries’ representatives. It is bad enough that the Commission should represent a Eurocentric, self-regarding and neo-liberal trade policy, but is it not rather crude, Mr Lamy, untruthfully to try to make Europe’s popular movements jointly responsible for the shameful abuse of power of which the EU was guilty in Doha? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its repercussions in the short and medium term may prove disastrous for the peoples of many countries, particularly the less developed countries, but also some in the European Union, namely Portugal. For my country, the opening up in the agricultural and textile areas, including the bilateral agreements being negotiated by the European Union, such as that with Pakistan, without taking Portuguese requirements into account, is particularly worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">For the economic and multinational groups, the most important factor was achieved: the opening of negotiations for greater liberalisation of world trade, postponed in Seattle and openly called into question this year by world organisations, namely those which were present at the World Social Forum of Porto Alegre and at Genoa. The triumphant declarations of UNICE (European employers’ organisation) show this clearly when they state that the principal issue was settled, even if not all its demands were fully satisfied. The final resolution of the WTO itself, referring to liberalisation in particularly sensitive areas such as textiles, important aspects of agriculture, services and others, including the area of intellectual property, leaves little doubt, although its consolidation in practice could yet be influenced by any disputes that may develop. Even a few small positive advances in the field of intellectual property, after the pressure which countries like Brazil and South Africa brought to bear in order to obtain generic drugs to combat AIDS and malaria, show that it is important to step up the fight against capitalist globalisation in its various aspects, whether political, economic, social or environmental. The European Union trade associations have already condemned the opening of negotiations within the WTO framework without at least having secured real progress in upholding compliance with the ILO agreements and minimum standards of defence of workers’ rights, given that there can be no sustained development without social and environmental development. The liberalisation of international trade favours the rich countries and multinationals, deepens the gulf between developed and less developed countries, as is clearly shown by studies conducted under the aegis of the UN, intensifies the exploitation of communities and workers by multinationals which dominate international trade and which are only interested in making maximum profit, even if it is at the expense of child labour, food safety, the environment, family farming and multifunctional farming. Hence the importance of mobilising support for the fight for an alternative of sustained development which places priority on reducing poverty and social expansion, which promotes a review of the CAP, which is more coherent, which provides more mutual support and which is less isolated from the countries of the South. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Qatar trade round was to become a round for the benefit of the developing countries. This objective has been partly achieved. Partly, because Europe, like other rich countries, refuses to cut down on market-distorting aid. Europe’s euphoria about Qatar can therefore be put down more to the expected trade liberalisation for its own benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that Qatar has given the umpteenth green light for the reform of our agricultural policy. The challenge is to guarantee farmers a reasonable income without distorting the world market price. Direct income support, and a widening of the agricultural packages of tasks and rewards are positive steps towards that goal. Even after Qatar, the impression remains that not all Member States are adopting that line.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter of major importance for developing countries was the clarification of the agreement on intellectual property. There may be the political explanation that patent law should not obstruct the production of life-saving medicines in emergency situations, this explanation is not entirely satisfactory. Indeed, it must be possible for countries which do not boast an industry which produces these cheaper medicines to import them freely. The legal problems which emerge in this connection deserve a resolute approach. To avoid misuse, inspection to establish whether there is indeed an emergency situation is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would underline that in the fight for the environment and social standards, not distortion of competition, but market access for poor countries and their well-being should be the EU’s most important driving forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It did this, so from that point of view it was a success. Yet for whom was it a success? It was, no doubt, Commissioner, a success for you, since you proved that you enjoy excellent health and the ability to work through the night. Talking of health issues, Doha was a real success as far as medicines are concerned, but it is chiefly due to Osama bin Laden that the poor people of the world owe their entitlement to access to medicines. In other words, if the USA had not been afraid of anthrax and had not, therefore, had to challenge Bayer’s intellectual property rights, they would not have given in.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, what did we get out of Doha? The answer is, two things, a few clichés and a reprieve. The clichés are piling up. First of all there are those clichés about world trade leading to growth, stability, and of course peace. We had already signed a trade agreement in Marrakesh, and everyone knows that that agreement brought about peace in Gaza and in Palestine, and even peace in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great cliché is that Europe would have held out, but was abandoned by Japan. The least developed countries, despite having been given everything except arms, also abandoned it. Korea has maybe stayed with it. The European Union is showing cracks. The French farmers are on their own again, apart from some support from Ireland. However, Europe did obtain a victory on the environment and social affairs. On the environment, the United States, which is not a party to the Kyoto agreement, did not associate itself with us, and on social affairs, all the European trade unions have expressed their highly negative opinions about Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Europe obtained a reprieve. First of all there was the agricultural reprieve. Until the end of the negotiating round, and therefore until 2005, our farmers will have internal aid and restitutions. After that, we agreed that these will be abolished. However, the French representatives Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin called for a stay of execution so that they can get through the presidential elections without any trouble. They obtained that stay of execution for the CAP, which was facing the death penalty, so well, in fact, that when Poland accedes to Europe, Polish farmers will be deceived because they will be joining the Europe of the CAP when in fact, from 2005 onwards, there will no longer be one.</p>
<p class="contents">We also obtained a reprieve for foreign investments. The IMA was thrown out of the OECD window only to return through the WTO door. We also obtained a reprieve on pensions. The insurance companies will not immediately be able to appropriate this large market for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">After Doha, therefore, we are left with the following situation: the European agricultural model has been broken up, the European cultural exception has been forgotten, and the long-term European social model is at risk. What will remain of Europe? It will be merely a vast free-trade area, and everyone knows that, according to Adam Smith, free trade equals national poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They thought they had exiled the WTO to the desert. Doha's very remoteness brought about a compromise anyway, one that was signed by all 142 members. What a contrast with Seattle in 1999, when debates on content were overshadowed by clashes on the street. I was there when militant demonstrators paralysed our conference and, in professional fashion, immediately supplied photos of the performance they put on. Doha again saw highly polarised debates between the seven hundred accredited NGOs and the national delegations, but it achieved important results. Three years are to be spent working on a new world trade round in order to facilitate further liberalisation of the global economy. The EU had its way in agricultural issues. One aspiration is that subsidies should come to an end, but this is not a precondition of the forthcoming negotiations. It is unfortunate that investments and environmental issues could not yet be put on the negotiations' agenda; they will be on it in two years’ time at the earliest. We all have to give way somewhere – the USA on hormonally treated meat, the labelling of genetically modified produce and the opening up of the textiles market. The EU, too, must dismantle barriers, above all, Commissioner, as regards protection of farming.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strike a balance between the opening of markets and their regulation. On the one hand, import restrictions are to be dismantled; on the other, the import of low-quality cheap produce is to be prevented, for, firstly, they are a danger to the consumer, and, secondly, pirated copies and infringed patent rights cost businesses billions. We are opposed to total liberalisation. Social security and public services need to be tested, but state monopolies should not be dismantled while private ones are built up. Changes to the agenda are just as important. Let us then call for sustainable protection of the environment, social standards and the punishment of human rights violations.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, congratulations on being seated there today. Thank you to the two Commissioners who are present and thank you also to the whole of the Commission's team. I would also like to thank the Council. I believe it was only by working together that we managed to achieve real success here. I include in this, by the way, our colleague Mr Westendorp, who headed our delegation and, unfortunately, is not here this evening, but I believe he deserves as much gratitude as everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">There are just a few points that I want to address. First, I believe that many Members have yet again forgotten a number of things, above all those whom I always describe as permanently engaging in mantra politics by repeating the same thing over and over again. I believe that they are forgetting that Doha opened a way ahead for negotiations and laid down a strategy for them. We should give more consideration to how we can work together with the Commission and the Council in future, for it is only now that the actual negotiations are happening. The subjects for discussion must be defined, and it is by no means certain that apparent successes we have achieved on many points will prove to be lasting successes over the years, and so I would like to ask the Commissioners in particular how they actually envisage cooperation with Parliament. I would like this cooperation to be substantially more precise and detailed, giving a much more accurate view of the state of negotiations you will be engaged in on the various subject areas, and also signalling where there are difficulties or problems, not only giving definite information on many points, but actually facilitating political monitoring as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make another point. I believe it will be much more important than in the past to join up policies on trade and foreign affairs. I would particularly like to mention in this context two regions – the European Union and the United States. I believe that the European Union and the United States bear to an incredible degree responsibility for the future definition of trade policy, which is much more than can be summed up in the traditional trade themes we were familiar with in the past, incorporating as it does so many new ones. Development of traditional trade policy and its connection with new subject matter will be the difficult task to be faced in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">You – above all Commissioners Lamy and Fischer – managed to bring that off elegantly in Doha, but, as I said at the outset, the real work is only getting under way now. I believe we must attach much more emphasis to putting foreign policy regarding countries such as, for example, India, Singapore or China, but also regarding many of the Latin American countries, on a much firmer footing, using a stronger foreign policy to achieve greater understanding for what we actually want to achieve in the sphere of trade policy. There is still the prevalent feeling in certain countries and states that we are actually using our trade policy to engage in indirect protectionism. We should take care that this sentiment does not arise in the first place, and that, if it does, it can be rooted out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Singaporean Ambassador has again drawn my attention to his country's long-standing desire to conclude a free trade agreement with the EU. I believe that bilateral free trade agreements bring with them the possibility of opening doors of that sort, and also have the potential to achieve greater multilateral rapprochement by means of bilateral negotiations. Commissioners, perhaps you would be so kind as to tell us what you think about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Doha Conference has spawned a sense of enthusiasm that I can only ascribe to the fact that expectations were so low, for I have to say that we remain very critical. Inequality of power is simply too pronounced in the world, which leaves its mark on conferences of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">While the developing countries wanted to see the earlier agreements through to a conclusion, Europe wanted to continue to build at multilateral level. There was therefore a certain level of ambiguity which has facilitated some progress. We are, of course, delighted with the fact that in connection with medicines, unmistakable progress has been made, because there is now at least an agreement about the intellectual property rights. However, we are hugely vexed by the fact that Europe continues to insist on high import levies on agricultural and textile products, while an agreement on a gradual cutback had, in fact, been reached. The first results should be evident as soon as 2005, and upon further research, it now emerges that too little has happened in this field. At the moment, agricultural support as a whole is hardly any lower than at the end of the eighties.</p>
<p class="contents">As at previous WTO conferences, the liberalisation of the economy was also mentioned at Doha. Although the issue of intellectual property rights may have been a positive illustration of this, surely this was only a tiny ray of hope. Ideally, we would like see that we side with the weak, for whoever observes this world at war is bound to see that this is all about inequality of power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further liberalisation is still the main objective, that is, opening up the markets in poor countries to the industrialised products of the developed countries which, at the same time, will import agricultural produce to compete with our own, together with raw materials at derisory prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In the agricultural sector, the main aim is to wipe out subsidies, which would strike a tremendous blow to production in countries such as Greece where, I should point out, farmers have taken to the roads yet again in order to demand a fair price for their labour.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to foreign investment, competition, public procurement and commercial arrangements, the ‘because I say so’ approach has been used to impose imperialist choices, despite the almost universal opposition of non-governmental organisations and the less developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting in Qatar confirmed the WTO as the main tool of capitalist globalisation. Any interest evinced in the problems of less developed countries and the environment is lip service and, as such, mere hypocrisy. It does, of course, show that the mass demonstrations have had an impact and that the WTO is trying to hijack the anti-globalisation movement by appearing to be sensitive to its concerns. But it took good care to shield the meeting from troublesome protestors and we would not be surprised if the next meeting were held in Antarctica.</p>

<p class="contents">It is true that the final declaration does not say everything it should say and, I would say, that sometimes it says more than it should say, but any negotiation means reaching compromises and compromise requires concessions. The thing we must really value about Doha is the bringing together of the diverging, and sometimes contradictory, interests of the Member countries of the WTO and an agreement has been reached to launch a new round, set an agenda, a timetable and a working programme, and, secondly, that the development dimension has been fully integrated into all negotiations and that the least-developed countries and the developing countries have spoken out strongly and their voice has been heard and their concerns taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO train, as you said quite rightly, Commissioner Lamy, is back on the rails and has already left the station. I would add that furthermore the means have been provided so that its destination may be a sustainable growth which also benefits the poorest countries. However, in order for that train to reach its destination, the necessary means must be adopted, the texts must be interpreted correctly, since they are full of structural ambiguities, and guarantee reciprocity in the opening up of the markets and full respect for the rules which govern multilateral trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to help to overcome the barrier of poverty once and for all, we must adopt the necessary measures to facilitate access, above all by the least-developed countries, because these countries may suffer as a result of the multilateral commercial system, due to the advantages we offer to the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have seen is a declaration on access to medicines and public health. Even the title is important because it is not just about access to medicines, it is about support for public health. It is groundbreaking and, as someone said this morning, it has within it a commitment to the whole question of flexibility of the agreement on TRIPS. As the Commissioner is well aware, the United States and Switzerland, in particular, argued that the reference to public health was too broad. They wanted it to be limited to certain infectious diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">But I have to say, Commissioner – and you will agree – that what happened represented a real victory for developing countries because they were skilled in negotiation, and that position by the US and Switzerland, in particular, was finally rejected. It is important that we pay tribute to developing countries and to the negotiating skills that they displayed.</p>
<p class="contents">The belief traditionally fostered by the pharmaceutical companies has been that patents are sacrosanct. After Doha that has changed. If drug companies price medicines beyond the reach of people who need them, governments can override patents without the fear of retribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the progress at Doha, as far as patent rules are concerned, the story is far from over.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two specific questions, Commissioner. Does the Commission agree that the immediate challenge is to ensure that the WTO lifts the restrictions on the export of cheap equivalents of patented drugs to countries which have decided to override a patent but do not have the necessary manufacturing capacity? That issue was not resolved at Doha and has been referred to the TRIPS Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how does the Commission intend to ensure that countries without production capacity or insufficient production capacity can make full use of the compulsory licensing provisions? This must, in my view, be accompanied by a reduction in the length of drug patents in poor countries. TRIPS currently dictates a patent term of 20 years world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">At the review of the rules scheduled for 2002, the WTO should at least agree to extend the deadline for TRIPS compliance for all developing countries and base it on development progress rather than on arbitrary dates. I wonder if the Commissioner agrees with me on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of developing countries, I would like to pay tribute, in particular, to ACP countries, in which we have a particular interest and partnership in the European Union. The 77 ACP countries succeeded in obtaining a waiver. They put out a brilliant declaration before Doha. I have had several meetings with them since then. They are well pleased with the results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet what have the developing countries gained from Doha? I do not share other Members’ optimism on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, the agreement on access to medicines, which appeared to be a victory, is really a decoy to lure the media and the developing countries. Presented as a vital stake at this conference and as a major concession to the developing countries, the clarification of the TRIPS agreement and the interpretation of it – which has always been our interpretation – are admittedly a political victory, but that victory changes nothing from the legal point of view. It is of no value before the body that settles disputes within the WTO, and, as Mrs Kinnock has pointed out, the question remains unresolved for those countries which have no production capacity. For the time being, nothing allows them to use compulsory licensing in order to arrange for the medicines they need to be manufactured by third parties, and this point was emphasised at the recent conference in Ouagadougou.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the derogation and the WTO’s reciprocity rule, which were granted at the last minute to signatory states of the Cotonou agreement for a period of eight years, appeared to be a positive achievement. In reality, however, that authorisation, which the ACP states had been waiting for for months, seems more like blackmail as far as they are concerned. They were obliged to sign the final Doha declaration or risk having their request refused.</p>
<p class="contents">The gains were therefore minimal, and were used by the countries of the West, which are united in their desire to launch a new round, as a means of buying what they wanted. In reality, what happened at Doha was more like a cynical play at the theatre. We are becoming increasingly committed to unbridled liberalisation and, as we shall continue to insist, a fundamental reform of the WTO really is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It took place in excellent conditions, despite all the fears that we may have had. Holding this event in Qatar was in itself a response to the war against terrorism that we entered into following the tragic events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Like other Members who took part in that conference, I appreciated the constant transparency that prevailed between the Council, the Commission and Parliament during the negotiations. That transparency was also the order of the day among the NGOs present at Doha, who are to be congratulated on the efforts that they have made in this direction since the previous conference in Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">We all hoped that this conference would lead to a substantial agreement that would pave the way for growth to be stimulated, thereby contributing towards economic development at a time when the international community is going through a very difficult situation. This ministerial conference certainly enabled considerable progress to be made on various fronts, including the inclusion of China and Taiwan. Another positive result, as has already been mentioned, was in connection with medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, the Commission took a tough stance in the negotiations, and the efforts that it made during the final night and on the morning of 14 November enabled the European Union to convince its partners that its positions were well-founded. However, the work programme is still lagging behind the ambitions that we had set ourselves on certain major issues, such as the environment, the Singapore agenda and social standards.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I should like to make three comments. During the conference, the developing countries often adopted a highly critical attitude towards the European Union. When we were preparing for this ministerial conference, did we listen carefully enough to their concerns? Let us show humility, let us take up our pilgrim’s staff again, let us listen to them and try to understand them, so that we can take their real concerns into consideration, and above all let us stop taking their place in defining the development policy that they need.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Doha ministerial declaration constitutes an undertaking to start negotiations on the priority issues of European enlargement and integration. Finally, now that the real negotiations are about to start, I hope that the transparency that has prevailed so far will continue to do so, and that it will be strengthened still further between us. I have just one question to ask the Commissioner. What will be the general structure of the negotiations which will be defined? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also, above all, like to say how pleased I was with the excellent cohesion and solidarity between our three institutions which were represented in Qatar. Basically, and restricting my comments solely to the agricultural issues, I was interested to discover that the European Union has given itself the room to manoeuvre that is needed to reform its common agricultural policy in response to the new expectations of our society, because non-trade considerations were explicitly mentioned in the final ministerial declaration. It seems to me that this aspect is the vital element in the outcome of Doha. The priority for European farming today should no longer be to remain competitive in exports at any cost. It should be to satisfy social demand as regards food security and the sustainable rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union can also take advantage of a success that it has achieved with regard to the United States, because all forms of aid to exports will be subject to negotiation in the new round. Finally, it seems to me that the Union can congratulate itself on the fact that special and differential treatment for developing countries has been strengthened. That should enable them to respond to their needs, including those needs relating to food security and rural development. This prospect, in its turn, is more likely to encourage the development of farming for food production, and is therefore very important from the point of view of the world demand for food, which is expected to double in the next twenty-five years owing to the increase in the populations of the developing countries and the improvement in living conditions in the emerging countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In all, I believe this agreement represents a good balance between trade liberalisation and regulation, and also between trade and the development of all types of farming. I just hope that the negotiations in the new round will fulfil the hopes that have now been raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The winners for now were the developing countries, whose principal demands, including the demands of the ACP countries, were accepted in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the Cairns group and the United States saw enshrined in the text the principle of ongoing agricultural reform, improved market access and the gradual elimination of export subsidies. The European Union succeeded in ensuring that this reduction in export subsidies would not be automatic and had some of its main demands in terms of reinforcing the non-commercial elements of the agreement included in the text. Despite the relative optimism of the Community negotiators, the agreement did not include some of our fundamental demands. Multi-functional agriculture was not expressly referred to in the text and the strengthening of measures for the protection of geographic indicators was only defined clearly for wines. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, one thing was made crystal clear: the elimination, even the gradual elimination, of export incentives, will create strong pressure to reduce agricultural prices internally. It will therefore not be difficult to conclude that the next reform of the CAP, before 2006, will have to be more thorough than may have been hoped. Not just because of the cut in the guaranteed prices it will involve, but also and especially because of the qualitative change in the instruments of support for farmers so that, even without market support, they continue to have an income safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">Doha was merely a starting point and much has still been left open. But let there be no illusions. Today, our commercial adversaries are fighting for an end to the supposedly more distorting support of international competition, but tomorrow they will want to impose an end to all types of agricultural subsidies, that is, the old story of the rings, the fingers and then the rest. It would not be fair to end without paying special tribute to our Commissioners for the courage and firmness they showed in these negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not only that that is regrettable; we must not overlook the minimal acceptance of environmental and food safety, and the failure to accept the demand for clarification of the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, to my main criticism. The EU often happily talks about the social dimension as a part of our European philosophy, but all it has achieved as regards the issue of core labour standards as human rights in the workplace has been to return them to the position discussions had reached at the 1996 Singapore Conference, that is, they have been put on ice. What has become of our social responsibility? Perhaps this next observation will not be lacking in interest. I basically welcome the fact that China has joined and that, hopefully, other countries will do so as well, but I doubt that it will become any easier to achieve basic human rights standards at work. So the beginnings of an opportunity have certainly just passed us by.</p>
<p class="contents">I warn against taking conflict prevention too lightly. If sensible steps are not taken to monitor it, globalisation will spark further demonstrations and more social conflict. As Mr Mann has already pointed out, Seattle is not a thing of the past. It can be resurrected, and we, in the safe haven of the European Parliament, should not banish that thought from our minds. Commissioner Lamy, what are you thinking of doing in future to ensure that core labour standards are not only insisted on by the toothless ILO? How can you help us, after what has happened at the WTO, to make a new start and move things forward? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, though – in my opinion, Mr Ettl – significant that people are talking to each other rather than looking for points of conflict. I believe that this spurt of growth in Europe, especially in employment in Europe, is of enormous significance – but not only for Europe, for, particularly in the developing countries, millions of people will be able to cross the poverty line, something that represents a breakthrough for the poor in the developing countries as well. I believe this is of especial significance for Europe, which is the world's greatest exporter of goods and services and the world's biggest investor.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions covered many areas affecting the developing countries, the environment, social affairs and animal protection too, and I believe that efforts are being made to find consensus here as well. We should not forget, though, that the WTO should also be concerning itself with the creation of fair general conditions for investment, competition and market access. We must remove the administrative obstacles to trade and take reciprocity into account when opening up markets; we need maxima for customs duties and reliefs for SMEs and for products sent in small quantities. Where trade works, so does democracy, and prosperity is the result.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take the view that the real, economic actors should be more deeply involved in the negotiations, and I believe it is right and proper that we should bring in EuroCommerce, Eurochambres, UEAPME and the SME-Union, so that they can join in discussions on this subject. To tell the truth, conglomerates no longer see the WTO as the core issue – there is already a McDonald's in every city in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by asking another group to explain to us how they are going to handle the confidentiality of discussions between the Commission and Parliament in future. I believe we need a solution to this in order to guarantee good, honest cooperation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We may ask: is a Europe taking form that is greater in spirit and in intent? A Europe with new aims, a Europe capable of performing its international role better? I hesitate. It is permissible to doubt. The Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Qatar in itself justifies tempered optimism. The European Union’s action through its representatives, namely Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, was difficult but frankly positive. In fact, European diplomacy contributed decisively to the positive results of the Conference and hence to putting an end to the paralysis of the World Trade Organisation, to restoring its credibility after the resounding failure of the Seattle Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitments undertaken by the European Union are far from fulfilling our main priorities, particularly in the environmental and social spheres. The European representatives were, in fact, faced with a dilemma, where they saw protection of nature and social rights, the representatives of the developing countries saw only disguised protectionism of European interests. Therefore, there are grounds for hope, but also grounds for disappointment. It is worth emphasising the positive aspect of the negotiations with regard to agriculture, which are, at last, prompting and stimulating an in-depth reform of the CAP which the European Union proved incapable of carrying out internally. Equally praiseworthy are the results obtained with regard to medicine prices and the undeniable victory achieved over the egoism of the pharmaceutical multinationals. The Doha Conference represents just a small step along the steep path that aims to harmonise liberalism and regulation, a small step for globalisation to contribute to world progress and especially to the reduction of poverty, hunger, disease and violence.</p>

I see the most important success at Doha as having been the formulation now contained in the Doha Declaration, which gives us the chance to decide for ourselves the direction we will take in agricultural policy. That is both an opportunity and a responsibility. It is an opportunity because, unlike in the Uruguay Round, we are not so much standing with our backs to the wall in a situation in which, while we continually just said 'no', the other parties to the WTO Treaty determined the direction of future policy. It is, though, also a responsibility in so far as this outcome does not mean that we do not have to make further appropriate developments to our agricultural policy. It is this task that now faces us, and it is one that we must take very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism from some quarters has been that we, the rich part of the world, continue to exploit the developing countries with the help of our refunds on exports. I take a somewhat different view of this. I believe we should not ourselves make the mistake of hanging on to old images of a former agricultural policy. Four per cent of the Community budget is hardly going to put the whole world's agricultural trade out of true, and we use no more than 4% of the total Budget for the promotion of exports. I also, by the way, take the view that we really have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to imports. The European Union alone imports more agricultural produce from the developing countries than do the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan put together.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers have rightly pointed out that the work is only just beginning, something for which we will have to make proper preparations. It goes without saying that we will make our further preparations in consultation with Parliament. What still matters above all, though, is working at convincing others. We cannot assume that our ideas about the future of agriculture will be accepted elsewhere in the world without needing to be explained. I cordially invite you to join with us in carrying on this work of persuasion together.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with heartfelt thanks for the many compliments we have received today. I see them, though, more as an appeal to us to carry out our responsibilities in the future.</p>

<p class="contents">I should also like to thank, as Mr Fischler has done, those of you who have attributed part of that success to those negotiators who are this evening sitting on the Commission benches.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard everyone who has spoken, I believe that the broad majority among you approve of what was achieved. The fact that your approval is not completely unanimous is a matter of regret, at least for Mr Fischler and myself. We shall try to do better next time.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the results obtained are of good quality is really due to the fact that this is the product of policy work in which Parliament and the Council played an important part. I believe that Doha has reminded us of a basic rule of Community algebra, which is that the weight of the negotiators is an exponential function of the solidarity of the Union. Once again that rule has proved to be true. Yet that solidarity was neither the result of a sudden act of faith nor the expression of blind confidence in the two negotiators, whatever the qualities that you have emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the solidarity derived its substance from the Union’s negotiating position and from the balance, which is in some ways intrinsic to our mandate, between liberalisation and regulation, between our general concerns here among the countries of the North and our openness towards the concerns of the countries of the South, between the specific values that we, as Europeans, wish to defend and our openness towards a number of the concerns felt by partners who do not necessarily share those values.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we did not achieve our objectives one hundred percent. That is true but, as in any negotiations, we reached a compromise, a compromise in which everyone can be a winner, since we are not playing a game in which the stake is zero. However, it is true that on the social side – and I think that neither Mr Fischler nor I have sought to conceal the fact – we have not made as much progress as we would have liked. Many of you have, quite rightly, said as much, and we shall have to keep working on it in other forums.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say a word to those people whom I have heard criticising the development aspect. To be honest, I find it hard to understand their criticism, since the developing countries have been able to express themselves and make their voices count at this ministerial conference in conditions that they have never been able to obtain before, and I can say to this House that the Union played a part here, and if the developing countries were able to obtain a place at the conference table – both during the conference itself and during the preparations for it – which is much better than it has been before, it was to some extent the result of the efforts that the Union had been making in various places.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we shall be tested during the next round of negotiations, on our capacity to remain faithful to this viewpoint, particularly when it comes to adapting our programmes of technical assistance for development to fit the ambitious negotiation programme which has been decided on. We shall have plenty of opportunity to verify it with our African friends during the phasing-in period after Cotonou and the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the question about the order in which things will happen, I can say that the real negotiations, particularly at technical level, will start at the beginning of next year. I would suggest that we stick to our usual successful working methods, in other words, as things develop, continuing in what I believe to be more or less complete transparency, we should keep one another informed about developments in our mutual positions, and in particular about the Union’s negotiating position.</p>
<p class="contents">The structure of the negotiations themselves is still being finalised. On this point, we shall have to be scrupulous and careful to ensure that a certain number of the political balances that we obtained in the negotiating programme are not destroyed by some underhand means as a result of timetables with variable speeds, which would have the result of dealing with some subjects before others.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific subject of intellectual property and medicines, as someone has already pointed out, the question of the use of compulsory licences by a developing country which does not have its own production capacity still has to be sorted out, and we shall be actively considering this issue and other issues too. We shall be proposing solutions that will be in the same spirit as what we have already done in order to achieve this compromise, a spirit which those of you who are familiar with the Commission’s position in February last year will easily have recognised. It should be noted, in passing, that most of the countries in question are exempt from the disciplines of the agreement on intellectual property until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to those of you who would like to see a reform of the WTO and who have pointed out, quite rightly, that this is not included in the working programme, I would reply that I share your view. Some progress has, admittedly, been made since Seattle, at least in practice, without making any formal changes to the rules of procedure. This is true in the case of transparency, and it is true as regards having a much larger number of the actors who sit around the WTO table being involved in the decision-making process, but I think that at Doha we probably went as far as we could in terms of what informal action can add to formal action, and I think that we shall have to think about this matter very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">As most of you have said, the serious negotiations are only just starting, and will continue during the years to come, in all probability with the maximum negotiating intensity somewhere between 2003 and 2004. We therefore have a little time to prepare for the peak in the negotiations which will no doubt occur at around that time.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that our method of working together has produced some good results, and I hope that during the negotiations we shall retain this spirit, which is at one and the same time positive, resolute and open, and which is the spirit in which we have been working for the last two years. In any case, you can count on Franz Fischler and myself to ensure that that is the case as far as the Commission’s contribution is concerned.</p>
