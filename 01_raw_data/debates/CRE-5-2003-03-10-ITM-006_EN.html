<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ayuso González (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at last we have reached an agreement so that this directive can be approved and we can therefore offer a stable framework for companies which are investing in these fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress and express my gratitude for the cooperation of the various rapporteurs – Mrs Rothe, Mr Kronberger and Mr Clegg – which has been excellent. I trust that on Wednesday we will all support this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The final text is not the one Parliament would have liked, since at first reading it stated its desire for binding objectives. However, we have shown a significant degree of flexibility in order to bring ourselves closer to the Council’s position and this has taken the form of nine amendments. Of all of them, I would like to highlight the one relating to the reasons for which a Member State can have different objectives to those in question and I would respectfully ask the Commission to verify compliance with this Article 4 of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I congratulate you on this second directive to promote alternative and renewable energies which respect the environment. But I genuinely regret not being able to extend these congratulations to other members of the Commission, who are resisting proposing coherent measures which, from the point of view of other policies, would assist compliance with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring specifically to the Environment Directorate-General, which, since 1998, has been due to establish technical specifications for biofuels and captive fleets, as laid down in Directive 98/70/EC. Establishing these specifications is urgent and inexplicably the opportunity to do so was missed on the occasion of the recent revision of the aforementioned Directive 98/70/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything suggests that we will have to wait until 2005, when this directive is going to be reviewed, to have clear specifications. I hope that this is not the case and that the problem can be resolved sooner. For as long as these specifications do not exist there will be no quality standards to apply to biofuels. This is a significant vacuum in relation to the quality of marketed fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a paradox that the Environment Directorate-General should make proposals to reduce the sulphur content of all types of fuel and not make the least effort to promote the marketing of alternative fuels, which significantly reduce emissions and which contain no sulphur.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Agriculture Directorate-General – what can I say? – it has recently presented a mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and this establishes aid for energy crops of EUR 45 per hectare, considerably lower than that for other crops and a more than insufficient maximum guaranteed area of one and a half million hectares for the whole of the European Union. Furthermore, it is proposed that 10% of land must permanently be left fallow and energy crops will not be able to be produced there as they have been until now.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be acceptable that, on an issue such as the one we are dealing with, with benefits for such diverse sectors as emissions, the replacement of oil and rural development, Community policies display such a flagrant lack of coordination. Meanwhile, in the United States, Brazil or South America biofuels are receiving decisive and coordinated support from those governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives set in the directive are ambitious, but achievable. The action plan proposed by the Commission sets an objective of 20% alternative fuels by 2020. Some may believe that this is unrealistic, but they also thought this of the directive promoting renewable energy which was approved two years ago. This directive established clear time limits and objectives and continued the support systems. Despite opinions to the contrary, the growth in these forms of energy has been astounding.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is forward-looking and will open the door to the development of other fuels and technologies. I have absolutely no doubt that, with will and solidarity, we can create a market for biofuels which ensures that they are competitive in the future. I would therefore ask this Parliament to support the approval of the report next Wednesday and I trust that the Council will reach an agreement as soon as possible on the directive on the taxation of energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for the serious way they have analysed this report. Furthermore, I would like to thank this Parliament for the support it has been giving to this issue from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of this directive we will have specific legislation for combating greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the directive provides benefits from the point of view of the security of energy supply and it may eventually lead to the creation of employment in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement on this proposal, without going to conciliation, would eliminate any possible final reservations of the members of the Council with regard to the Commission’s proposals on tax relief for biofuels. As you will know, this proposal now forms part of the framework directive on taxation in energy and I believe there has recently been really encouraging progress and we hope that the Council will soon adopt it and it will enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept all the amendments proposed, although I would like to comment on Amendment No 2 a little later.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I will deal with Amendment No 8, which is the key amendment. Throughout this entire process the Commission has promoted the inclusion of binding objectives. We believe that this would send a very clear message to the industry with regard to the seriousness of our proposal on biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise, however, that the procedure so carefully drawn up in the Council’s Common Position, with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, provide a solid basis for action and may provide a system for reaching an agreement between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, the States will have to establish objectives for biofuels. These objectives will have to be based on the provisions of the directive; that is, 2% in 2005 and 5.75% in 2010, which represents an increase in the overall use of fuels in each of the countries. This clearly represents a very significant but realistic increase – as the rapporteur said earlier. The States which for any reason want to set lesser objectives, will have to justify it and there are a series of criteria on which that justification will have to be based.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that the Commission, like Parliament, would have preferred the list of criteria to have been restricted to the points established in Amendment No 8. However, we accept that equally valid reasons may still arise for the establishment of lesser objectives. And we recognise that for the majority of States the use of biofuels in transport will be a new area of activity; we cannot therefore make a final judgment <span class="italic">a priori</span> on the obstacles which may arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is firmly convinced that any other criterion used by the States to justify different objectives must be equivalent to the those laid down in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will mention Amendment No 2. Recital 13 stresses the importance of the standardisation of fuels and proposes that the Commission and the standardisation bodies supervise and implement these standards in order to guarantee that biofuels gain the confidence of consumers and manufacturers. Within this context, Amendment No 2 proposes stressing, in particular, volatility parameters. However, there are various parameters in relation to rules for fuels and in this regard we believe that perhaps the amendment should say ‘including volatility parameters’. We can therefore accept this amendment in principle but with this modification.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank the rapporteur, all the members of the Committee and Parliament for your support and naturally I can assure you once again that, as you have requested, the Commission will ensure strict compliance with the provisions agreed for this Directive and I hope that the Council will shortly approve the taxation elements, which are essential if it is to have real content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if she is not wholly satisfied with it, I think she has done a splendid job.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just as well that we do not have mandatory requirements but I think that, given goodwill on all sides, we will see some progress in the application of biofuels. With the European Union already importing 50% of its energy needs and this rising to 70% by 2030, it is important that we exploit all possible indigenous resources of energy as well as promoting greater diversity of energy sources. By developing biofuels and other renewable energies we are contributing to increased security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In my constituency in Scotland, we have the materials and the know-how to be able to develop this industry and are eager to put these proposals into action. We are also hoping to improve our environment with better air quality and a reduction in greenhouse gases. In the blending of biofuels into conventional transport fuel we can introduce these changes in a simple way that will not require vehicles or filling stations to be adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">Biofuels also promise to create new jobs in rural communities through crop production and in the construction and operation of processing plants. This will provide a well-needed boost to the flagging rural economies. But biofuels remain uncompetitive without significant government tax breaks. A 50% reduction in tax to match conventional fuel prices will mean subtracting a hefty chunk from Member State exchequers. How many of our governments are prepared to lose this revenue?</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned that the proposals as they stand will not necessarily result in any major real environmental benefits: production methods for most biofuels use substantial amounts of energy and create high carbon dioxide emissions. We may also see higher inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Member States must decide to promote biofuels that give an overall cost-effective benefit to the environment. Most importantly we must also invest in research to improve the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of biofuel crops in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that here too, on the issue of biofuels, Parliament is continuing to honour its cross-party commitment to promote renewable energies. It is good to know that in our efforts to do so we can usually count on the Commission's support. I have serious doubts, however – and that is putting it mildly – as to whether the Council feels the same commitment as does Parliament to our joint target of doubling the proportion of renewable energies in the total energy consumed by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">At the first reading, Parliament came out in favour of binding targets for increasing the use of biofuels. As with the directive on promoting electricity generation from renewable energy sources, this did not stand a chance in the Council. We have therefore agreed, as we did for the electricity directive, to indirect targets, with the option of moving to mandatory targets at a later stage if the actual rate of increase falls significantly short of the target set.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's intention to give the Member States a whole series of opportunities for setting their national targets at levels which diverge from the prescribed 5.75% by 2010 is unacceptable. I very much hope that the Commission will scrutinise the reasons for departing from the indicative targets, which the Member States will have to provide, in a really very critical light.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this critical assessment of the Council position, I can say on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that we will grit our teeth and vote in favour of the compromises contained in the Council position. Why? We want a shift towards renewable energies to be promoted in the fuel sector too so as to make a positive contribution to the necessary minimising of CO2 emissions, to reduce our dependence on oil and to give a boost to development in rural areas. To achieve this it is not only targets that we need; it is also crucial that the Member States should be able to give tax breaks to biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment – and I will be quite open about this – this is our only possible course of action because the Council actually has our backs up against a wall. If the promotion directive does not go through the codecision procedure in the form that the Council wishes, then the tax directive – this has been made clear to us – will not be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the new European constitution will make such a situation impossible in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the shortcomings that I have identified, I hope and indeed I am confident that this directive, together with the tax breaks, really will give a further boost to increasing the use of biofuels.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now taking the first step in the right direction, although the use of biofuels must be promoted far more vigorously from here on in. I think the targets should be binding, which is what Parliament insisted on at first reading. Parliament’s position also took account of the different circumstances that exist in the Member States by making it possible to have temporary derogations. I well understand the rapporteur’s willingness to show flexibility with regard to the mandatory nature of the targets in order for any real progress to be made in this important area. This time we shall not get any further ahead. The compromise amendments are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Many factors speak in favour of increased use of biofuels. Firstly, by promoting their use we reduce the need for imported energy and hence the EU’s dependence on external energy production, and especially oil imports. Secondly, biofuels are a renewable energy source and therefore a much better option in terms of the environment than petroleum products. I also regard as very important the point of view that biofuels are a means of boosting employment. That means new opportunities for farms and also where agricultural competitiveness is facing huge difficulties in the more traditional areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, biofuels help to reduce over-dependence on oil-based fuels, which is a cause for concern as regards both the environment and security of supply. Secondly, biofuels are environmentally friendly and they emit between 40 and 80% fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the target we must reach to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Accord and reduce the excessive use of greenhouse gases, which only result in a depletion of the ozone layer.</p>
<p class="contents">Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste. This makes it possible to use waste materials, which would normally be thrown away, in order to produce energy. Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries. We must take advantage of the job opportunities which could be created in research and technological activity. There is clearly a divergence of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament as to whether mandatory targets should be set for the use of biofuels in Europe. We must do all in our power to bring about the greater use of biofuels. The economic and environment benefits are obvious. Biofuels must be introduced, targets met and the work of Member States' governments strictly monitored and evaluated. European governments should radically change tax systems to encourage European industries to invest more in the biofuel industry. It is not only the present generation which will benefit from these new changes, but also future generations. I wish to compliment Mrs Ayuso González on her excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A directive on increasing the use of biofuels is something that I can only welcome, but I do regret the fact that the current situation falls well short of my expectations. It is precisely by increasing the use of biomass that we can contribute both to securing farmers' income and creating new jobs in the current and enlarged Europe as well as to enhancing the multifunctional role of the countryside. In addition, such an initiative meets the requirement of sustainability, which is so important from the point of view of protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all this, the compromise proposals on the table are rather disappointing and reflect a definite dilution of the original demands, because all that is left of the original obligation to blend – as we might have expected – are reference values. It would actually have been very pleasing if the Austrian model, which makes it mandatory for more biomass to be used, could have served as a model for Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to note that unfortunately the final paper contains too few incentives for a more efficient use of biofuels. Once again the discrepancies between the interests of the fossil fuel industry and farming are clear for all to see. Given the finite nature of oil deposits and bearing in mind the Kyoto targets, we can only hope for the future that this is not a closed book, that further efforts will be made to push up the use of biofuels and that this really is just the first step in the right direction, if all of us really do feel a credible and serious responsibility for providing future generations with a secure foundation on which to live.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both these challenges are placed before us when we talk about biofuels and alternatives. Measures to reduce the impact upon the climate and to increase the security of supply are important. The transport sector is one of the most important areas when it comes to the long-term security of supply. This is strongly linked to environmental work, but the transport sector is also important to economic development and the possibility of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Fuel alternatives are extremely welcome. The use of biofuel may contribute to a reduction in the use of existing fossil fuels and to developments being steered in the right direction. The ‘right direction’ means reducing the effect upon the environment. Alternative fuels, including biofuel, must be introduced in a cost-effective way. The objective of sustainable development must be our prime concern, and we must act with a view to the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">New technology is being developed constantly. Today’s new technology will be old-fashioned and ineffective tomorrow. Through the decision we take today, we must avoid making future technological development more difficult than necessary. We should instead behave in such a way as to facilitate future leaps in technology without ignoring safety or sustainable development. As I said before, the decision we make must reflect long-term thinking. The focus must therefore be upon promoting those biofuels that, in view of their life cycles, have particularly good characteristics in terms of climate, environmental impact and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade and industry need stable basic conditions if managers are to feel confident about their assessments for the purposes of investment. It must be possible to write off new plant in a manner commensurate with the timescales for technological development and with the costs of new plant. It must not be made more difficult to use biofuels in their pure, or all but pure, forms than to use fuels blended from fossil fuels and a small amount of biofuel. It is also important for the individual Member State to be able to decide what form of biofuel is most suitable on the basis of the fundamental conditions that prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this background and the position adopted a while ago by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we are on the way to adopting a constructive long-term position in the European Parliament and one characterised by the goal of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive is especially important because developments in this very area of transport up till now have been absolutely pitiful. My colleague, Mrs Ayuso González, has really done an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport accounts for more than 30% of the end use of energy in the Community and that figure is growing all the time. This trend will become stronger still and there will therefore be an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. This increase will be still greater in the candidate countries, relatively speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission’s White Paper, carbon dioxide emissions associated with transport are estimated to increase by 50% over the period 1990–2010, and the main source of emissions is road traffic, which accounts for 84% of carbon dioxide emissions connected with transport. This is why the White Paper is calling for less dependence on oil by the transport sector, for ecological reasons. This is currently at a rate of 98% and would be reduced by using alternative biofuel-like fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting the use of biofuels in keeping with sustainable farming and forestry practices will create new opportunities for sustainable rural development. This could play a part in the creation of new jobs in rural areas. Moreover, it will be possible to obtain by-products, which, owing to their vegetable protein-rich content, could be used as animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Growing plants for biofuel production would have to be combined with current programmes for cultivation, adhering to the principle of crop rotation. To guarantee the existence of sustainable cultivation practices we should nevertheless draw up a set of clear environmental criteria so that, for example, using the same cultivated area later on for food production does not pose a risk.</p>

She has negotiated really very energetically and with great skill in this field. I should also like to thank the Commissioner once more for tabling an ambitious proposal. We all regret the fact that the proposal as tabled by the Commission and with the improvements made by Parliament at first reading was not adopted, but we are already making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantages of extending the use of renewable raw materials to the transport sector have already been mentioned many times. They include cutting emissions, reducing our dependence on oil and above all creating more jobs in farming and rural areas. I regret the fact – and I must say this quite openly here – that no one from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has taken the floor, because the Greens have after all expressed rather critical views in the debate and I had thought that we might perhaps discuss this again here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is right that we need to take into account the environmental impact of biofuels, but we must not be one-sided. I might simply remind you of the tanker disasters that we have had in recent years. If these tankers had been carrying biofuels then the damage would, God knows, not have been as devastating, and biofuels do not need to be transported across the oceans either.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to promote innovation in this sector. That is why Mr Purvis was right to say that efficient and environmentally friendly fuels must be given particular support. I would add that the first step is to start promoting them at all. I fully endorse the criticism of the Council, as expressed by Mrs Rothe among others. I think it is regrettable that we cannot go further, and I will say quite explicitly something that perhaps Mrs Rothe cannot say in so many words: I am also particularly disappointed by the German Government. The Germans were not the only ones who put the brakes on, but they also had every reason to adopt a rather more constructive attitude towards the Commission proposal and our position from the first reading.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important because, as Mrs Rothe has said, it is not sufficient simply to state principles. It is not sufficient to say that 12% of our energy must be renewable. We must take measures so that that becomes the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I confess that when I make a promise I like to fulfil it. The promise had been made by others. I am trying to take measures so that this promise, this agreement, this commitment made by all the countries in this Parliament and in the Council, of 12% renewable energy, may genuinely be achieved. I believe this is an extremely important measure, together with the provision on green electricity. It is not perfect, we would all have liked to have had obligatory objectives, but I believe the compromise contained in this proposal is reasonable and puts significant pressure on all the States of the Union to finally comply with what has been said here.</p>
<p class="contents">In the transport sector there are very few measures we can take to reduce CO2 emissions, but this is one of them and, by supporting it, I hope that we can implement it quickly, in addition to the issue of taxes, which is essential if it is to really work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
