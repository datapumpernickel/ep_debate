<p class="contents">Parliament queried the regulations with the European Court of Justice on 30 April 1997, and this was resolved on 25 April 1999. The judgement of the Court (joint cases C-164/97 and C-165/97) repealed both Regulations and stated that the Council should have used the former Article 130s, now Article 175 of the Treaty as the sole legal basis, but the effects of the repeal were suspended to enable the Council to adopt new Regulations with the same aim within a reasonable time period.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission and the Member States committed themselves, on an international level, at the Ministerial Conferences on the protection of the forests in Helsinki, in 1993, and Strasbourg, in 1990, to the continuous monitoring of the damage suffered by the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody is aware of the important role played by the forests in all respects, both economic as well as ecological and social, and of their role in relation to soil protection, climate, water and flora and fauna, creating balances which are essential to the development of sustainable agriculture and for the management of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have established networks of systematic monitoring and observation posts for intensive and continuous monitoring of the forest ecosystems. These studies require long periods of implementation and their results depend, according to the improvements in the knowledge of the cause-effect relationships between the changes suffered by forest ecosystems and the factors which affect them, on carrying out this work of monitoring, prevention and study over a longer period.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fires, work is underway into their causes, prevention measures and the monitoring of the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">As for pollution, work is being done on the establishment of observation networks, on carrying out a periodic inventory of the damage by means of a single methodology, intensive and continuous monitoring of the forest ecosystems and the implementation, by means of pilot projects, of methods of conservation and restoration of the forests affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Member States must carry out a periodic assessment. In the proposal approved unanimously in the Environment Committee, minor amendments are introduced which I would ask the Commission to take into account, since this would prevent us from extending the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal asks that the Commission be assisted by a standing committee on forests, as it is in many other areas; that it present an analysis of the application of this regulation with regard to its ecological, economic and social aspects, as well as a cost-benefit evaluation; that an amendment be included on the Mediterranean forests as a specific ecosystem for the southern countries and because of its importance in combating desertification and erosion.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the budget for implementation, I have a reasonable doubt: for the previous period of these regulations, the Commission proposed EUR 40 million to fight pollution, for the five years, and EUR 70 million for fire prevention. Now, for the next five years, the Commission proposes 34 million to fight pollution and 50 for fire prevention. It has just reduced the amount by 6 million for the fight against pollution and 20 million for the prevention of fires, without taking account of the rise in the cost of living index or the incorporation of new countries, Austria, Sweden and Finland, which almost double the area of forest in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our proposal would be to increase that budget to 44 million and 77 million for pollution and fires respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the President, since Mr Cunha is not present, to allow me to use his two minutes, as he told me previously.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have a proposal by the Committee on Budgets. The Committee on Budgets is once again presenting amendments in which it wants no kind of notification to appear with regard to the budget for implementation. I believe that the Committee on Budgets is trying to evade the codecision procedure, and I would propose to this House, and also to the Commission, that their amendments not be taken into account...</p>

In several areas of the European Union, the forests are often the only viable economic option, because of poor soil or the lack of other natural resources. It is also clear that the importance of forests is by no means limited to economic factors. They encompass many other dimensions of social and environmental interest, such as the protection of the soil, the fight against erosion, the preservation of water resources, biodiversity, climatic stability etc. Despite all of this, the forests have been a kind of ‘poor relation’ amongst Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only after many years, in 1998, with the efforts of the European Parliament, that the European Union finally managed to approve a strategy for the preservation and development of forests. However, given forestry’s unquestionable interrelationship with agriculture and its territorial impact, it is extraordinary that the Commission has not been more ambitious in its proposals and that the Council has historically been so short-sighted.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the European Union’s forestry strategy is a step forward in terms of ideas, it is yet to have any practical expression. On the contrary, in some ways it has moved backwards, as demonstrated by this Community regulation on the protection of forests. With regard in particular to the aspect which is of great concern to my country – the regulation on combating fires – it is regrettable that whereas in the period 1992-1996 the European Union benefited from an annual sum of EUR 14 million, this annual sum is now to be reduced to EUR 10 million, that is, by 40%. Therefore, Mr President, I would like to suggest to the Council and the Commission that they increase this amount and, if possible, create a Community system for information on forest fires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Redondo is presenting, under the general heading of forest protection, a report on two proposed regulations. One refers to atmospheric pollution affecting forests, and the other refers to the prevention of fires.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell Mrs Redondo that the delegation of Spanish Socialists is going to support her amendments. We are going to support them because we agree with all the arguments which Mrs Redondo has put forward, and for other reasons which she has not had time to explain. The basic regulations date from 1986 and 1992, and now the budget for implementation is lower, despite the fact that, since the accession of the Nordic countries to the European Union, the area of forest is greater.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, atmospheric pollution has worsened as a result of acid rain, and of greater concentrations of dangerous products in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in a much worse situation in terms of fire prevention, because of climate change and the drought which we are suffering in many parts of Europe. I would like to give just two recent examples. This week there has been a Mediterranean forest fire on the border between France and Italy, a fire in the Ostia pine forest, near Rome, a fire in the Region of Valencia, where I live, and furthermore there has been one death, of a farmer who was trying to put out one of the numerous fires which have occurred this week as a result of drought and heat.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these arguments more than justify Mrs Redondo’s amendments, and our support for them. I wish to tell the Commission – and I am sorry that Mrs Wällstrom is not here at the moment – that one of the European Union’s priorities with regard to the environment should not only be the fight against pollution and fires, but also, above all, a policy of caring for the forests. That is why we are going to support her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Nordic countries, we obviously do not have the same problems as in the Mediterranean area. It is therefore incorrect to talk in this context about the forests of Europe. The forests of Europe are very, very different from one another. I could spend all night and all of tomorrow talking about the history of the forests and about the enormous importance Europe’s forest areas are going to have in a future sustainable Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">However, this report concerns the threats to our forests. For the forests in northern and central Europe, the greatest threats are from airborne forms of pollution. Unfortunately, we cannot prevent pollution by means of forest policy but only by means of environmental, traffic and agricultural policy, in short through general environmental policy. Because most forests are damaged by discharges which come from a long way away, responsibility for the air and climate is global and European. </p>
<p class="contents">Fires do not constitute a problem for the Nordic forests. On the contrary. To obtain environmental certification, the owners of the forests have to burn down a certain area of them each year. We need more fires. We set fires for ecological reasons. In the Nordic forests, there are a great many species of plant which have waxed seeds. They have to be warmed up by a fire in order to grow. In the Nordic countries, there are also insects which need burning ant hills in order to breed. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should support the southern countries’ need to fight fires, but that not all forests can be lumped together by talking in this context about European forests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe, however, that it will suffice to allocate huge sums of money in the future – huge sums in relation to previous expenditure, but still less than is actually needed. The most important thing, to my mind, is the need to change people's perceptions, not simply with a view to loosening purse strings but also with a view to engendering the level of voluntarism that is essential to the protection of our forests.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Alpine regions, for example, the institution of voluntary fire brigades is taken for granted. Efforts should also be made to establish such bodies in the Mediterranean Member States, not only as a means of fighting forest fires at their source and creating protective infrastructures but also as a means of fostering public willingness to provide neighbourly assistance and voluntary service. In this respect, I believe that people's mentalities will have to change, because money alone is not the answer.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forests are, furthermore, an imaginary, mythological and symbolic asset, which we should not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there has been a certain recuperation of the area dedicated to forests in the European Union, every year thousands and thousands of hectares fall victim to acidification. Year after year, huge areas of forest burn in Europe, annually destroying, on average, around 1% of the total forested area. Biodiversity is also affected, and the situation of various plant species is worrying. Therefore, the importance of these two regulations is unquestionable, despite the fact that the Community appropriations involved are very modest.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been pointed out, the regulation establishing an action framework for the prevention of forest fires and the reduction of the area burnt is undoubtedly of particular importance to the south of Europe. This regulation is specifically aimed at the cofinancing of systems for the prevention, monitoring and provision of information about fires, as well as for identifying their causes. It is therefore extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Geographers understand this very well. The most southerly part of Mediterranean Europe is threatened by a process of physical desertification, in the literal sense of the word. The climatic phenomenon which originated in the Sahara desert has not stopped at the Mediterranean Sea and is spreading to the Iberian, Italian and Balkan peninsulas. Mediterranean woodlands, which act as a curtain, reducing the impact of this phenomenon, are being mercilessly destroyed by these fires. This issue of forests does not only concern the countries of the south, whose territories are affected, in the same way, of course, that the defence of the Nordic forests is not only of exclusive interest to the Nordic countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the south, more than any other part of Europe, urgently need a policy for the protection of forests. I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and say that I support her proposals and her objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More attention must be paid in the protection of forests to the effect of climate change. We have succeeded in bringing traditional forms of air pollution under control in the last ten years, thanks also to EU directives, but at the same time, the risk of changes to global weather patterns getting out of hand has grown. This development must also be looked at when reviewing the way the forests of the Union are monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on the subject of the Community’s forests must be reformed, but Parliament cannot undertake financial commitments until the present regulation expires in 2001. In this situation the suggestion that there should be an increase of tens of millions of euros for just a little over a year is not reasonable. It is not sufficiently justified by the fact that the Union’s forest area has grown since the last round of enlargement. The situation is so different between the north and the south. For example, in Finland and Sweden we long ago reached the stage where the forest is used as it grows.</p>
<p class="contents">Here at Union level at the moment we are discussing many genuine legislative proposals concerning forests, including a common position on the emissions ceiling directive and on the directive relating to large incineration plants. They must be supported, so that they are as successful as possible and so that we can do more to protect the forests as a result.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of these proposals is to adjust both Regulations in the light of the judgment of 25 February 1999 in which the European Court of Justice declared that Article 130s of the EC Treaty – which has now been renumbered 175 – was the proper legal basis for these instruments. I should firstly like to say thank you very much to the three rapporteurs – Mrs Redondo Jiménez, Mrs Auroi and Mrs Sbarbati – who have been examining the Commission proposals that are under discussion today for their cooperation as well as for the amendments they have put forward. </p>
<p class="contents">This new legal basis automatically means that the codecision procedure under Article 252 applies and that the financial framework laid down in this Regulation becomes binding. It was also necessary to bring the annual budgetary framework for these two initiatives into line with the amount of funds actually allocated by the budgetary authority in the period from 1997 to 2000 and with the amounts already earmarked in the preliminary draft budget for the year 2001. That is why it is impossible for the Commission to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 12, which would involve an increase in the financial framework. Nor can the Commission subscribe to Amendments Nos 5 and 11, which relate to the comitology and provide for the use of the consultation procedure in the case of both Regulations. The Commission takes the view that this procedure would be inconsistent with the decision of 28 June 1999 on the comitology. The Commission believes that the substance of the relevant amendments should be discussed again in connection with the revision of both Regulations, which is due to take place in 2001. The Commission will present its proposals for their revision before the end of this year. It has no problems, however, with Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
