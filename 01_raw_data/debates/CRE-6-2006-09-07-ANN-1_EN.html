<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not in itself binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the September I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September 2006.</p>
<p>The police teams mentioned by the Honourable Member are set up within the G6 group and so do not operate in an EU framework.</p>
<p>However, on the basis of experience gained in cross-border policing, the following answer of a general nature can be given.</p>
<p>The police teams are under the control of the state on whose territory they operate. This is true both of joint investigation teams and of the Member States’ mutual assistance in police matters.</p>
<p>That being so, the state in which the police team operates in principle bears political responsibility for the team’s activities.</p>
<p>The team's powers are defined by the national legislation of the state in which they operate. As regards joint investigation teams, the legal framework for cross-border surveillance and for cross-border hot pursuit is laid down in EU law.</p>
<p>Whether the team wears the same uniforms is decided jointly in accordance with both the national law of the state in which they operate and the legislation of the state sending the police officers.</p>
<p>For example, in combating football hooliganism, it is customary practice for foreign support teams to wear the uniform of their own country.</p>
<p>Members of the team operating in their own country have the same power of arrest as national police officers.</p>
<p>Whether the foreign members of the team have the power of arrest is determined by the legislation of the state in which the team is operating.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in question time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September 2006.</p>
<p>The honourable Member alludes to the matter of Turkish relations with its neighbouring country, Greece. With regard to this, I would like to remind everyone of the relevant conclusions of the Helsinki European Council in 1999 and the one in Brussels in December 2004. As a candidate country, Turkey must comply with the values and objectives of the European Union described in the Treaties. It must show unconditional commitment to the aim of good neighbourly relations and solving border disputes, adhering to the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. This being the case, all action that could have a negative impact on the peaceful resolution of disputes must be avoided, as stated in the conclusions of the European Council of 15 and 16 June.</p>
<p>These matters, which are also included in the negotiation framework, are short-term key areas in the amended Accession Partnership, and the EU will be systematically raising them at the meetings with Turkey that form part of the political dialogue. That was also the case at the last meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006, when the EU specifically said it deplored the fairly recent incident that had taken place in the Aegean Sea, especially as it had led to loss of human lives, and stated that cases such as these only had a negative effect on good neighbourly relations.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that these matters will continue to be followed closely and will be raised if necessary at all levels, because good neighbourly relations are one of the criteria by which Turkey’s progress towards EU membership are measured. Obviously, progress in this area will also enhance the negotiation process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0652"></a>

<p>The President thanks the Honourable Member for this question.</p>
<p>In my opinion the EU has no reason to reconsider its support for membership of the WTO for Russia. Its membership would be advantageous to both sides - both the EU and Russia would benefit from it. It would create more open and stronger preconditions for trade and investment and give the EU a favourable forum for the resolution of trade disputes with Russia. The possibility of WTO membership also gave Russia an additional reason to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, the negotiating process gives the EU influence over Russia with regard to problematic issues relating to Russia's relations with the EU, which include issues of health and plant health, charges for flying over Siberia, freedom from discrimination for railway transport to or from foreign countries and customs clearance charges.</p>
<p>It would therefore be contrary to the EU's economic and commercial interests to withdraw its support for Russian membership of the WTO.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0654"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in question time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September 2006.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member says, the question of raising the minimum for excise duty on alcohol is one of the Finnish Presidency’s key themes in the area of taxation.</p>
<p>Since the minimum for excise duty on alcoholic beverages was established in 1992, it has not been altered while the internal market has been in force. When you consider that the average inflation rate in the EU for the same period has been in excess of 25%, the minimum excise tax has decreased when measured proportionately.</p>
<p>The permitted volumes mentioned by the honourable Member are the guide levels specified in Council Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products.</p>
<p>These guide levels were only laid down because the tax authorities in the Member States could state with reference to them that the products in question were for personal use and not for sale.</p>
<p>The Commission had proposed to the Council that the directive should be amended. Under the proposal, Member States would no longer be able, among other things, to make use of the limits in question.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal was discussed by the Council’s competent bodies, with no agreement being reached.</p>
<p>With regard to other aspects of the subject, may I point out that one of the health issues mentioned in the Council’s action programme for 2006, as drawn up by Austria and Finland, is alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>At the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council to be held on 30 November 2006, the Finnish Presidency proposes to hold an interministerial debate with reference to a Commission communication on an EU strategy on alcohol, which pays special attention to the increased use of alcohol among the young. The strategy will aim to lessen the harm to health and the social harm caused by alcohol and impact on the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p>In the same connection, the Council intends to note the Commission’s report on the implementation of the Council Recommendation<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 5 June 2006 on the drinking of alcohol by young people, in particular children and adolescents, both in the Member States and at Community level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in question time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September 2006.</p>
<p>Developing the EU’s energy market and improving the reliability of supply are among the Council’s key areas of action during the Finnish Presidency. Regional cooperation on energy is a useful step towards a fully integrated EU single market. We have to stress that these Regional Markets should be regarded as an interim stage.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 9 June 2006 on the single market in energy, the Council clearly stated that the coordinated development of regional energy cooperation should be accelerated while facilitating the integration of the regional energy markets into, and the further development of, the EU internal market. This should be done particularly through adequate and coherent interconnection and access to interconnection capacity, paying particular attention to countries and regions with energy networks that are largely isolated from the EU energy network. This would therefore also cover the area referred to by the honourable Member in her question.</p>
<p>The Council would also refer the honourable Member to the decision recently taken on the endorsement of guidelines relating to the Trans-European Energy Networks. These energy networks include, as one example of electric power projects that are in Europe’s interests, the connection of Poland and Lithuania, which includes the upgrading of the Polish electricity network and the PL-DE section as necessary to allow participation in the internal energy market.</p>
<p>The Council would like to remind everyone that it is the private sector that is mainly responsible for investment in the network. There needs to be more effective cooperation between companies, governments, international financial institutions and the Commission in the area of realising investments. The Commission has started to draft a communication to be presented in January 2007 on a priority plan for interconnection of the networks. It is the Presidency’s opinion that the work should focus on the links which are most important for the Union as a whole, including those from energy sources located outside the EU. The Presidency also considers as priorities those links to regions which lie outside the common European network.</p>
<p>One point mentioned in the Council’s conclusions of 2006 is, furthermore, enhanced cooperation and coordination, particularly between regulators, system operators, energy exchanges and governments.</p>
<p>The Council will aim to implement these principles and objectives in collaboration with the Commission in the months to come.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0663"></a>

<p>The honourable Member is referred to the Commission’s proposal to the European Parliament and the Council of 6 July 2005 for a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No. 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament, which is the report on the application of the provisions of the new Financial Regulation <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0181">COM(2005) 181</a> final – <a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2005/0090(CNS)">2005/0090 (CNS)</a>. On 18 May 2006, the Commission presented its modified proposal <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0213">COM(2006) 213</a> final – <a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2005/0090(CNS)">2005/0090 (CNS)</a>, which mainly included the opinions of other institutions and which took account of the concerns voiced by civil society. The Commission pointed out that, before the Council could adopt the Amending Regulation (within the meaning of the Joint Declaration of 4 March 1975), the Council and the European Parliament should negotiate the changes, with the active assistance of the Commission, in accordance with Article 184 of the Financial Regulation, if Parliament so requires.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is also referred to the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission made in May 2006 on Budgetary Discipline and Sound Financial Management. Under the Declaration on the Revision of the Financial Regulation contained in the Agreement, the European Parliament and the Council are firmly committed to concluding the negotiations on the Financial Regulation so as to allow its entry into force, if possible, on 1 January 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0667"></a>

<p>In its conclusions of 17 July 2006, the Council confirmed its full support for UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his efforts to head the political process to determine Kosovo’s eventual status. The Council also considered his intention to start direct political discussions on status to be a positive sign, and urged both sides to take a constructive role in this stage of the talks. The Council noted the report on the implementation of norms determined for Kosovo, which the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations presented to the UN Security Council on 20 June 2006. The Council noted that there had been conspicuous progress and stressed once again that the implementation of norms was a major priority and should be accelerated and realised more effectively. The Council urged Belgrade to encourage the Serbs in Kosovo to participate in the work of Kosovo’s institutions, as it was here that they could best promote their own interests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0669"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not in itself binding on the Council or its members, was not delivered orally at Question Time to the Council at the September I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September 2006.</p>
<p>The European Union is committed to effective multilateralism, and it was very disappointed that better results were not achieved at the Review Conference in New York from 26 June to 7 July 2006, which reviewed progress in the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. This disappointment was expressed to the conference in the closing address delivered by the EU Presidency on behalf of the EU and the Accession States.</p>
<p>The EU recognises the importance of the Review Conference insofar as it reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the principles, measures and objectives of the action programme. This commitment must now be converted into practical action at national and regional level, as well as worldwide.</p>
<p>Despite the limited results, the EU intends to remain at the forefront of work to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, including at practical level.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the preparation of a joint action has begun relating to EU participation in measures to combat illicit concentration of and trade in small arms and light weapons and munitions for them in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the joint action is to combat illicit concentration of and trade in small arms and light weapons and munitions for them in sub-Saharan Africa on both the supply and demand sides. This will deliver a powerful political message to the part of the world most affected by illegal supplies of small arms and light weapons and their excessive concentration.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the EU intends to further promote among third countries recognition of the fact that there is a need for worldwide guidelines concerning transfers of weapons based on the consensus reached at the Review Conference. Other prime fields for action by the EU are marking and tracing, arms brokering, munitions, mainstreaming issues relating to small arms and light weapons in development programmes and anti-poverty programmes, weapons held by civilians, gender issues, non-State actors, administration of surplus stores, portable anti-aircraft systems and human rights issues.</p>
<p>Finally, the Honourable Member is reminded that the EU has from the outset supported the initiative for a convention on the international arms trade, although drafting such a convention was not among the aims of the Review Conference. The EU will also play an active role in the drafting and adoption of a resolution on an arms trade convention. This resolution will be considered at a future meeting of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0675"></a>

<p>In addition to the fact that the present rules on automatic decommitment of appropriations (Articles 11 and 157 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities) are still being applied, the Council would draw the questioner’s attention to the new arrangement, that is to say, Point 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1), whereby the proportion of expenditure not taken up under sub-heading 1 B may be used to cover the effects of adjustments in amounts allocated from funds supporting cohesion to any Member State recording a difference of more than +/-5% from the cumulated gross domestic product estimated at the time when the agreement was drawn up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has accepted Parliament’s request to improve the take-up of appropriations by allowing the implementation of budget commitments entered annually during the first three years of the next programming period (2007-2010) to continue beyond year n+2 into year n+3. This arrangement will be applied to Member States with particularly weak economies whose per capita GDP is less than 85% of the EU average. The rise in the co-financing rate for these Member States is also likely to reduce problems related to the capacity to make use of funding (Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006, Articles 93 and 53).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0677"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in question time in the first part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in September 2006.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission or a Member State has the right to propose that action in areas referred to by the honourable Member should fall under Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Such a decision requires the unanimous agreement of the Council and a recommendation to the Member States to adopt that decision in accordance with each Member State’s constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>As the procedure is based on the current Treaty, it does not mean that the Constitutional Treaty is being implemented. The Article 42 in question was included in the Treaty on European Union in the Maastricht Treaty, and it was extended in the Treaty of Amsterdam to cover police cooperation and criminal justice. All the Member States have ratified both Treaties in their parliaments after democratic debates or referendums.</p>
<p>The Presidency would like to state that the European Council of 15-16 June 2006 asked the incoming Finnish Presidency “to explore, in close collaboration with the Commission, the possibilities of improving decision-making and action in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice on the basis of existing treaties.”</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the Commission released its communication ‘Implementing the Hague Programme: the way forward’. In that, the Commission proposes using the passarelle in Article 42 TEU, allowing the transfer of policing and judicial cooperation on criminal matters from Title VI in the Treaty on European Union to Title IV in the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p>The Presidency is committed to fulfilling its mandate from the European Council and proposes to act on the basis of this Commission proposal.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Presidency would like to point out that the use of the ‘gateway’ clause does not in itself signify that consensus would no longer need to apply. The Council may decide that some sensitive policies should still be decided upon by a unanimous vote among the members of the Council. Even if the principle of unanimity remains in force, transferring Title VI of the Treaty on European Union to Title IV would have several advantages, one of which is the European Parliament’s closer involvement in the decision-making process. This would promote the acceptability of decision-making with regard to issues which are important for EU citizens everywhere.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0681"></a>

<p>Initiatives to promote multilateral assurances on nuclear fuels may be vitally important in the creation of incentives which may help try and prevent the continued spread of sensitive nuclear technology. The Council is following developments in this area closely, especially within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. All the Member States of the EU will attend a special event organised in connection with the IAEA General Conference this year, at which the subject of multilateral assurances on nuclear fuels will be discussed. The High Representative has been invited to be one of the keynote speakers, but his personal representative will stand in for him.</p>
<p>Discussions between the Member States and the Commission and within the relevant Council working groups have already been initiated so as to establish a common approach by the EU to the question of multilateral assurances on nuclear fuels. Whatever the approach ultimately adopted, it must in any case be consistent with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty, and it must guarantee the viability of commercial nuclear energy markets both in the EU and outside it.</p>
<p>Under Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, the government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded. As at present there are no proposals to discuss an amendment to the Euratom Treaty, the Council has not adopted a position on this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0686"></a>

<p>(EN) Community law does not include provisions aimed at standardising vehicle identification markings and logos intended for emergency service vehicles.</p>
<p>The situation within the various Member States differs significantly. Only few Member States have legislation dealing with these issues. Generally, each corps has its own identification markings, which is determined under the control of the supervision authorities.</p>
<p>In these conditions, harmonising the laws of the Member States would seem very difficult while providing little added value. Laying down harmonisation measures would create significant problems:</p>
<p>it would be necessary to require that existing markings and logos be replaced on all emergency service vehicles;</p>
<p>then, it would be necessary to ‘re-train’ the public to react to the new signals;</p>
<p>finally, it would be necessary to remove lettering in the language of the Member State, intended specifically to make the identification of most of the emergency service vehicles easier.</p>
<p>The added value of harmonised markings and logos seems limited by the fact that the Vienna Convention of 1968 on Road Traffic lays down the conditions for use of special warning lights. Emergency service vehicles are equipped with light systems emitting a blue light, which must be illuminated when the vehicle is on a priority mission. This has led to a uniform practice, ensuring full understanding of such emergency services in priority missions, throughout the entire Community even if markings and logos of different corps are not harmonised.</p>
<p>Thus, under the better regulation principle there does not seem any justification for the Commission to bring forward proposals and/or introduce legislative measures in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0621"></a>

<p>(EN) The commission thanks the Honourable Member for this pertinent question, at a time when the Commission is taking action to improve the way the legislative framework on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) is implemented, which should reassure the general public, stakeholders and Member States that Community decisions on GMOs are based on rigorous scientific assessments which deliver a high level of protection of both human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The view of the Commission is that the scientific assessment of GMOs should be beyond reproach and that we all have the necessary confidence in the relevant risk assessment procedures to underpin our decision-making. It is in this spirit that the Commission has developed a package of measures to effectively improve the scientific consistency and transparency for risk assessment procedures, actively engaging European Food Security Agency (EFSA), Member States and notifiers in related discussions on scientific issues.</p>
<p>EFSA and Member States have reacted very constructively to the proposed package during a technical meeting on 19 June 2006 as well as at the Environment Council of 26 June. Notably, EFSA has announced a number of actions for immediate application, which include convening regular meetings with Member States on specific risk assessment issues, including long-term effects, environmental impact assessment and allerginicity. Strengthened collaboration in the risk assessment process should contribute to building greater consensus and confidence on the strict EU regulatory framework on GMOs. The precautionary principle is a central piece of this legal framework, notably in the case-by-case assessment prior to any release. A GMO would certainly not be authorised if a potential risk to human health or the environment was identified during the risk assessment procedure. Potential long-term effects on the environment and biodiversity are importantly accounted for in our legislation, both during the risk assessment phase and as part of risk management, through post-marketing monitoring plans.</p>
<p>The Commission is thus duly engaged to making sure that market authorisations follow a very rigorous risk assessment procedure and that any authorising decision includes the appropriate risk management measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0665"></a>

<p>(EN) The marine environment of the Baltic is indeed under significant pressure. In spite of some important improvements in certain areas under the leadership of the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM), the evidence of the deteriorating status of the Baltic Sea has unfortunately continued to accumulate over the past years.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted last autumn an EU Marine Strategy. For the first time, the European Union is putting in place a policy framework – including a proposal for a Directive currently being discussed in the Council and in the Parliament - which specifically addresses the vital issue of protecting Europe’s seas and oceans in an integrated manner, looking at all pressures and impacts. The objective of the Strategy is to achieve good environmental status of the EU’s marine environment by 2021. The Strategy promotes cooperation within regional seas conventions – including the HELCOM. HELCOM’s long track record of scientific and technical competence and expertise combined with its Baltic-wide coverage and its demonstrated ability to work effectively at regional level makes it an invaluable partner in delivering the Strategy. Cooperation between all countries is indeed a precondition for successful protection of the marine environment.</p>
<p>The EU Marine Strategy is fully complementary with the work of HELCOM, in particular the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) under preparation. The Strategy will complement and bolster ongoing efforts to protect the Baltic Sea under the aegis of HELCOM by providing a legally enforceable framework at EU level. The BSAP is the cornerstone for further action in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>The BSAP makes HELCOM a front-runner and a model to follow among regional seas conventions in Europe. The Commission strongly backs the BSAP process and is taking an active part in its development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0671"></a>

<p>(EN) As already indicated in the reply to the Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2006-2700_EN.html">P-2700/06</a> on the same issue by Mr Drčar Murko in July 2006, the Commission is aware of the projects of two gas terminals in the Gulf of Trieste, although it does not possess detailed information on these projects and the current stage of the relevant authorisation procedure. The Commission also knows that there is a direct contact between the Ministries of the Environment in Slovenia and Italy, even at the Minister level, in order to solve this issue in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p>While there are in fact as the Honourable Member explains, several international conventions that might apply –each of these with its own mechanism for settling the differences between signatories, certain EC environmental Directives may be of application to this case, namely Council Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> of 27 June 1985, on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as modified by Council Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_22_5" name="refann_22_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, and Council Directive 96/82/EC<a href="#defann_22_6" name="refann_22_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, - so called Seveso II Directive as modified by Directive 2003/105/EC<a href="#defann_22_7" name="refann_22_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>of the Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2003.</p>
<p>The above mentioned Directives include mechanisms for the information of neighbouring Member States likely to be affected by certain projects.</p>
<p>It is useful to recall here that Member States are entitled to bring issues as the one at stake here before the European Court of Justice, pursuant to article 227 of the Treaty, after submitting the issue to the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining information received from the Italian authorities. However additional information is needed in order to fully assess the situation with respect to the obligations of the Italian authorities on the basis of EU legislation. Should the Commission come to the conclusion that Community law has been breached, it will not hesitate to take all necessary measures, including as the case may be the initiation of formal proceedings pursuant to article 226 of the Treaty to ensure full compliance with EC law in the present case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Because of improved analytical capabilities, it can be seen that human beings and all living organisms in general are exposed to the effects of pesticides in various concentrations. The decomposition of pesticides occurs mainly as a result of biochemical action (bacterial activity), but can also be caused by photochemical reactions (exposure to sunlight) and chemical reactions. Furthermore, the products of decomposition can be more toxic than the original compounds. There is a particularly pressing need swiftly to destroy old, obsolete pesticides, which are a threat to human beings and animals and might contaminate groundwater, in the new Member States.</p>

<p>In addition, Regulation 2004/850/EC on Persistent Organic Pollutants addresses the most malignant obsolete pesticides. Very recently concentration limits have been adopted under the Regulation, above which Persistent Organic Pollutants have to be destroyed via incineration or physical-chemical treatment.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the existing Community legislation is sufficient in order to safely manage old stockpiles of pesticides. In addition, activities related to the disposal of stockpiled obsolete pesticides may be eligible for Community funding.

<p>(EN) As a matter of principle, the Commission is in favour of the full application of the four freedoms in the EU, including freedom of movement for workers. This freedom is a fundamental principle of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted a report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements set out in the 2003 Accession Treaty on 8 February 2006. The available data in this report as well as the results of the extensive consultations with Member States’ authorities and social partners show that there is no real risk of unbalance in the labour market. Quite on the contrary, Member States that have not imposed such measures have enjoyed a positive result for their labour market and economies. Some non-desirable side-effects, such as undeclared work, are to a large extent a consequence of the restrictive measures.</p>
<p>As regards the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the transitional arrangement on free movement of workers agreed for these two countries follows the same principles as in the previous enlargement. In principle, all EU–25 Member States will apply national measures as regards movement of workers from Bulgaria and Romania. The Member States do not need to notify their decision to the Commission in advance.</p>
<p>So far, the only position that is known to the Commission is from Finland which has indicated its decision not to use the transitional arrangement vis-à-vis Bulgaria and Romania. As regards other countries, United Kingdom and Ireland have expressed their possible intention to use the transitional arrangement this time unlike in the case of EU–8, as well as the Czech Republic among the new Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission expects the other Member States than Finland to make their position known once the accession date of Bulgaria and Romania is clear. However, even then, the Member States have time until the eve of accession to formulate their position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0653"></a>

<p>(EN) Negotiations formally began with Croatia and Turkey on 3 October 2005. The first stage of negotiations got underway on 20 October 2005 when the Commission launched the so-called screening process with both countries. This process covers all 33 thematic negotiating chapters and will last until October 2006. So far 29 chapters have been screened.</p>
<p>Actual negotiations will start on each chapter once the candidate country concerned is sufficiently prepared in that area of the acquis. Overall progress will be based on each country's own merits and their ability to meet the requirements for membership. Different speeds will be the result of the pace of political and economic reforms in candidate countries themselves, the progress in aligning with the acquis and the capacity to implement it.</p>
<p>The Commission has submitted to the Council a number of screening reports on specific chapters recommending either a) the opening of negotiations or b) the setting of benchmarks that would need to be met first. As of 31 July 2006, this has led in the case of Croatia to an invitation to submit a negotiating position in 2 cases and for Turkey in 1 case. In addition, the Council has set opening benchmarks for Croatia in 4 cases and for Turkey in 1 case.</p>
<p>Actual negotiations have been opened so far on one chapter with each country (science and research). In both cases, progress was deemed to be sufficient also for provisional closure of this chapter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0672"></a>

<p>(EN) Combating violence in all its forms, against all citizens of Europe, is an important priority for the Commission. The Daphne II Programme (2004-2008) to combat violence against women, young people and children is a key element of the Commission's commitment to combat violence, and elderly women is an important group of the programme’s beneficiaries. The programme supports trans-national partnerships of Non-Governmental Organisations (ONGs) and local public bodies to tackle all forms of gender-based violence comprehensively from the angles of prevention, protection, support and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>In the area of elder abuse, the Daphne Programme has financed several projects dealing with this problem, and has recently put more emphasis on this topic. In fact, 3 out of the 57 projects selected under the 2005 call for proposal covered the abuse of elderly women. Projects dealing with the abuse of elderly women are also included in the proposed selection of 2006 (award decision still to be adopted).</p>
<p>Daphne projects on elder abuse confirm that:</p>
<p>There is a real gap in the services to support older women with very little information available in the EU on the problem or how victims can receive help.</p>
<p>There is no EU, national or local legal framework to deal with the problem of abuse or violence against older women or the protection of older persons who are vulnerable or with dementia.</p>
<p>Existing crime statistics often do not record the age or the sex of the victim, so data on the older population tends to be merged with general statistics about crime.</p>
<p>Older women are at particularly high risk of abuse and older women with cognitive impairments are at especially high risk.</p>
<p>The research found that there are no specific services accessible to older women victims of violence, so they tend to access other support agencies.</p>
<p>No systematic recording of information relating to the service users, such as age, reasons for accessing the service means that there are no concrete figures on how many older women access such support services as a result of experiencing some form of violence.</p>
<p>The Daphne Programme funded a research project in 2000 that looked at the recognition, prevention and treatment of abuse of older women<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The study reviewed existing prevalence data and concluded that the prevalence of mistreatment among the elderly population may be estimated at approximately 4% (which has later been confirmed by World Health Organisation data published in 2002, suggesting that 4-6% of elderly people have experienced some form of abuse in the home). The prevalence rates for sub-types of elderly mistreatment within all cases of mistreatment were crudely estimated by the project as follows: 31% prevalence rate for physical abuse; 40% prevalence for psychological abuse; 31% for neglect; and 27% for financial abuse. As many as 19% victims may be exposed to more than one sub-type of elder mistreatment. The project also confirmed that elderly women are in general more at risk of all forms of mistreatment than their male counterparts, with women accounting for perhaps as many as 70% of elderly victims.</p>
<p>Community statistics on crime and criminal justice are currently being developed within the framework of a 5-year Action Plan which will be the subject of a Commission Communication to the Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee in the next few weeks. During the period of the Action Plan, the coverage of specific types of crime – including violence against women and domestic violence - will be examined.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, the Commission has adopted a Communication on Actions for a safer Europe and a proposal for a Council Recommendation on injury prevention and safety promotion in June 2006. In both documents intentional injuries in form of interpersonal violence to which abuse of elderly people belongs are identified as a key priority area. Together with the Member States, the Commission foresees in the Community action plan to establish arrangements for a sound data collection in this sensible area and to develop joint prevention actions based on available data and identified models of good practice in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission is making enquiries amongst the national authorities responsible for managing the Structural Funds with a view to finding out whether the DBA group or the companies belonging to it have received Community aid. According to the incomplete information already received, the company DIM S.A., located in Bourgogne, received European Social Fund (ESF) support in the sum of EUR 95 012 relating to a 2004-2005 project involving basic skills acquisition and training. Furthermore, according to the information received from the Lazio Region authorities, the Commission can confirm that DBA did not receive any European Social Funds (ESF) contribution under the Operational Programme 2000-2006.</p>
<p>The Commission will inform Parliament of any further information it receives from the national authorities.</p>
<p>If it transpires that DBA or its subsidiaries have in fact received Structural Fund aid and have not then abided by the conditions linked to the granting or implementation of that aid, the Commission may ask the competent national authorities to take the necessary steps to make the appropriate financial corrections or to recover the improperly paid sums.</p>
<p>We would point out that the provisions relating to relocations of undertakings have been reinforced for the 2007-2013 Structural and Cohesion Fund programming period.

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member's assessment that tourism in both directions between China and Europe is exhibiting substantial annual growth and offers further business potential on both sides.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, EC service suppliers benefit from China's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) commitments since China's World Trade Oraganisation accession in November 2001. As regards hotels and restaurant services, EC companies have had access to the Chinese market from the date of accession, although in partnership with Chinese companies. Since November 2005 this requirement of Chinese partners is not applicable any more, and EC hotels and restaurants can own 100% of their subsidiaries in China. EC travel agencies and tour operators also benefit from Chinese GATS commitments in services related to foreign tourists travelling into China, under certain conditions. These restrictions will be removed in November 2007, when 100% foreign ownership will be fully authorised. It goes without saying that the Balearic Islands and their tourist industry as part of the EU can take profit of these developments.</p>
<p>In addition, the EC is also seeking new measures of liberalisation from China in tourism and travel-related services, among other services sectors, in the context of the on going negotiations on GATS within the current round of WTO talks, the so called Doha Development Agenda.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EC service suppliers benefit from significant growth of Chinese tourism in Europe since the implementation in 2004 of the Approved Destination Status Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Chinese National Tourism Administration (ADS).</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member mentioned, the Commission is currently working on a Communication to the Parliament and the Council on EU-China trade and investment relations. This Communication is a strategic review and shall guide the Commission in this relationship for the years to come. The adoption is foreseen for autumn 2006. In this context, the Commission undertook on-line and two public consultations as well as a large scale Conference. The Parliament will be held fully informed on all new developments in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0615"></a>

<p>The announcement by the New York Stock Exchange concerning a takeover of Euronext's trans-European stock exchange platform which is likely to create a vast transatlantic stock exchange market represents a new departure as far as takeovers and mergers in the financial markets are concerned.</p>
<p>The trend towards an excessive concentration of international stock exchanges - which first became apparent with the purchase by the American NASDAQ of a 25.1% share in the London Stock Exchange - is being driven by a need to cut costs. Alongside this over-concentration, there is a danger that investment activity will be concentrated in specific markets, to the detriment not only of so-called regional, small markets which are likely to be harmed, but also of major ones.</p>
<p>Given this new situation, does the Commission intend to promote Community measures to supervise and ensure the transparency of the operations of the stock exchange giants which are likely to be created? Does it consider it prudent to provide for measures to protect the European investment market from possible movements of intense investment activity towards specific markets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission and the Member States have in place robust competition regulation so as to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition. Any international exchange merger or acquisition that meets the thresholds for notification under the EC Merger Control Regulation or national competition laws would need to satisfy these competition rules.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that market forces should determine the optimal shape of European exchanges, subject to competition and regulatory questions being adequately addressed. The European stock and derivatives exchange landscape is at present highly fragmented despite the developments of the last several years. The Commission is not convinced that further concentration of exchanges would lead to detrimental outcomes for users of exchanges, including investors and issuers. Indeed, the Commission believes that in the single market there may be significant efficiency gains to be reaped from exchange consolidation which, with appropriate regulatory safeguards, can be expected to benefit exchange users by providing liquidity, low transaction costs and advisory services, and thus be beneficial to the European economy. Moreover, access to deeper and more liquid capital markets is very much in the interests of expanding firms located in the smaller markets – and, accordingly, also of the smaller economies themselves.</p>
<p>The Commission has just completed a massive program of legislative change which addresses among other matters the transparency of share trading and the transparency obligations of issuers of securities that are admitted to trading on a regulated market. According to the parties it is intended that the merged NYSE/Euronext entity would be dual listed in New York and on Euronext, so these transparency obligations would apply to it. The Commission remains prepared to consider possible changes to the supervisory architecture that might be necessary in order to cope with tomorrow’s challenges.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0619"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member's concern with regard to the violent repression of the peaceful demonstration in favour of women’s rights in Tehran on 12 June 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that such crackdowns run counter to Iran’s international legal obligations, including the right to peaceful assembly as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). As the Honourable Member points out, some 70 demonstrators - both women and men – were arrested on this occasion. It has been reported that a specially trained female police force was particularly violent against the demonstrating women.</p>
<p>In the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) conclusions of 17 July 2006, the EU drew particular attention to the 12 June 2006 events and the continued discrimination of women in Iran under the Ahmadinejad Government.</p>
<p>Thus, the EU and the Commission remain acutely aware of the situation and monitor with great care the developments. Indeed, in May 2006 and just prior to the demonstrations in question, the GAERC pointed to “….. the increasing violations on freedom of speech and religion […] as well as the intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, lawyers and minority groups”.</p>
<p>Monitoring is not enough, and the EU has therefore continued to raise its concern regarding human rights and the deterioration of freedom of expression via its diplomatic channels in Tehran. In this regard, a range of individual cases have been and continue to be raised with Iranian authorities. The Commission is actively involved in this, and it keeps reminding the Iranian Ambassador to the EC about its strong disapproval. At the same time, international human rights Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi and her network keep working tirelessly, against a regrettably very negative overall trend in Iran in the field of human rights.</p>
<p>Since December 2002, the EU Troika has – nonetheless – conducted a direct Human Rights Dialogue with Iranian authorities, with the participation of civil society representatives from both the European and Iranian side. As part of this Dialogue also women's rights have been discussed. Regrettably, and although we have kept insisting on its continuation, this dialogue has not been able to take place since summer 2004, due to the reluctance of Iranian authorities. Despite Iran's failure to engage constructively, the EU remains open to discussing human rights, including by means of the Dialogue process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0623"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has received several letters and parliamentary questions citing alleged violations of the EC Treaty's provisions on the freedom to provide services during checks and inspections carried out by the German authorities of, inter alia, Polish firms in Germany. In this context, the Commissioner in charge of Internal Market and Services would like to refer the Honourable Member to his most recent answer given on behalf of the Commission to the written question by Mr Szymanski (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-4639_EN.html">E-4639/05</a>) at the end of 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned by the manner in which companies from certain Member States encounter difficulties when providing their services in Germany. It is essential that businesses from all Member States are able to enjoy the same fundamental rights as their competitors established in the other Member States, and in particular the right to provide services.</p>
<p>The Commission has therefore contacted the German authorities. In their reply, they referred to the derogations they enjoy under the transitional provisions in the Accession Treaties regarding the free movement of services involving the posting of workers in some sectors. The German authorities, moreover, insisted that all supervisory measures are carried out in a non-discriminatory and proportionate way. In the absence of any concrete evidence of systematic discriminations or violations of the Accession Treaty, the businesses concerned can submit any problems of discriminatory treatment they may encounter in specific cases to SOLVIT or bring the matter before the national Courts. The Commission will monitor the situation closely and undertake every effort to ensure that Community law is correctly applied.</p>

Lithuania is no exception – the absorption of funds is sluggish there, too, and the main reason given for this is unfavourable technical circumstances: the projects are large and complex, there is a shortage of experts in Lithuania able to draw up environmental protection projects, the system of fund absorption itself is not running smoothly and, in addition, certain local authorities are hindering the process.</p>
<p>It is interesting that, in comparison with other projects, EU funding allocated to environmental protection projects is being absorbed with the most difficulty. Can the Commission indicate which new Member States are making effective use of the funds allocated to environmental protection and which are having less success in doing so? Can the Commission also comment on why such differences exist? Why has such a situation arisen specifically in the area of environmental protection? What would the Commission propose be changed, and how, in order that funds might be used more effectively?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Under the Cohesion Fund all of the new Member States have been equally successful in presenting sufficient environment projects to absorb the budget commitment credits available to the environment sector under both Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) and, since 2004, the Cohesion Fund. In all cases the policy objective of having broadly equal shares committed to the Transport and the Environment sectors is expected to be achieved by end-2006.</p>
<p>In relation to absorption of the ISPA and Cohesion Fund commitment credits through payments (advances or interim payment reimbursements based on expenditure on the ground) the progress varies from Member State to Member State. A recent comparison of the absorption of the available commitment credits by the new Member States is expressed in the table below in terms of the percentage paid by the Commission. These figures can sometimes change significantly over a short period, particularly for small Member States, depending on the presentation and treatment of payment claims.</p>

<p>Differences in the absorption of commitment credits through project expenditure on the ground can vary for many reasons. In relation to past experience, the Commission made available in 2005 an ex-post evaluation report that looked in detail at the experience with 200 Cohesion Fund projects assisted in the period 1993-2002 in the four Cohesion Fund Member States. The report is available on the internet<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The reasons for delays and difficulties in project implementation identified in the report and by the Commission include the following: weaknesses in project planning and design, national planning and environmental assessment legislation and procedures, technical weakness in the implementing bodies, procurement difficulties, budgetary or institutional uncertainty or technical difficulties in the physical realisation of the project. A number of these factors vary with the specific national legal, administrative and institutional context and / or according to specific weaknesses in individual beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The potential weaknesses in project implementation mentioned above apply equally to both the transport and environmental sectors. However in the environmental sector there is a marked tendency across many Member States for the division of responsibility for environmental services across a wider number of implementing bodies leading to smaller projects, more diffuse coordination, the fragmentation of expertise and widely different competencies between implementing bodies. This is particular so compared to the relative concentration of implementing bodies and technical expertise in the main transport sectors.</p>
<p>Where responsibilities are diffused in such a way technical expertise is more thinly spread, the spread of good practice is more difficult and, as a result, the incidence of those failings mentioned is higher. Also, there has traditionally been longer experience in most Member States in the construction of transport infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned that the commitment credits made available should be used promptly. The relative lag in absorption of the environmental credits is a matter for concern. Through ongoing dialogues with the Member States the Commission promotes, on both the political and technical levels, a critical appraisal of project generation, identification, selection and monitoring systems. However, it is the Member States responsibility in the first instance to use the opportunity of EU financing to the best effect and to ensure the optimal allocation or responsibilities at national, regional and local levels.</p>
<p>To promote efficient project management the Commission in 2004 presented a document to all Cohesion Fund beneficiaries on Quality Assurance Capability in the project preparation stage. The purpose of that document was to launch a dialogue with each Member State and raise awareness of the importance of pipelines of quality projects to lead to more predictable absorption. Bilaterally the Commission has drawn the attention of the Member States to potential changes that might improve project delivery and absorption.</p>
<p>The 2005 ex-post Synthesis Study makes a number of general recommendations arising from past experience to improve national project management. These conclusions were shared and discussed with all Member States during 2005.</p>
<p>With a view to the Period 2007-2013 the Commission has recently launched the JASPERS initiative (Joint Assistance for Supporting Projects in European Regions) in close cooperation with the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Its objective is to provide technical assistance support to national managing authorities to prepare high-quality projects eligible for EU support, have a multiplier effect through the spread of best practice and provide models which the beneficiary countries can replicate themselves. The Commission expects that the environment sector shall receive particular attention in those Member States identified as priorities for JASPERS support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) There is no requirement in European law for broadcasters in Member States to provide services like subtitling and audio description. In fact, provision of assistive services falls under content regulation which is handled at Member State level, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle. In essence, the “Television Without Frontiers” Directive (hereinafter: “the Directive”) is an Internal Market Directive. The objective of the Directive is to facilitate the free movement of television broadcasts within the European Community. The Directive seeks to attain this objective by laying down minimum standards which must be complied with by broadcasters under the jurisdiction of a Member State and generally prohibiting Member States from subjecting broadcasts from another Member State to any further control before reception or transmission. Equal access to television programmes or audiovisual services is extremely important. However, equal access is not an issue which has implications for the functioning of the Internal Market and therefore the Directive would not be an appropriate instrument for addressing this problem.</p>
<p>The Commission’s aim is to promote dialogue in regulatory and industry groups in order to spread best practices. The Commission has discussed accessibility matters within the Contact Committee of the Directive. In particular enriching content with audio description, audio subtitling, subtitling and sign language were discussed. The Commission has also submitted a questionnaire with regard to “Measures concerning access of visually and hearing-impaired people to television programmes” to the Member States within the Contact Committee. The answers from the Member States can be found on the Commission’s website:</p>
<p>http://ec.europa.eu/comm/avpolicy/reg/tvwf/contact_comm/index_en.htm</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to address the issues within the Contact Committee.</p>
<p>Promoting equal access for people with disabilities to the information Society is the goal of the actions proposed in the eAccessibility Communication<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This goal includes, inter alia, access for visually impaired and hearing impaired people to television programmes. Several ongoing actions are specifically addressing this issue. The Commission has been supporting standardisation work on accessibility to television through the European standardisation organisations. Within the Information Society programme, the Commission has supported several Research and Technological Development (RTD) projects that addressed accessibility to television programmes. For example with the automatic generation of subtitles for TV programmes, the development of avatars for automatic sign language for deaf persons and the development and trials of audio description services for blind persons.</p>
<p>The Commission, as stated in the eAccessibility Communication, will also continue to promote a consistent approach to eAccessibility initiatives in the Member States on a voluntary basis and to foster industry self-regulation. Two years after the publication of the Communication an assessment of the eAccessibility situation is foreseen. The Commission may then consider additional measures, including new legislation if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently working with Member States and consulting stakeholders with a view to define further the European eInclusion agenda that also contains an eAccessibility component.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission takes these concerns raised by the Honourable Member very seriously and its priority is the protection of the health of European consumers and the animal health status of the Community. The Commission has undertaken everything necessary to ensure that imports of beef from Brazil do not place the EU at unnecessary risk.</p>
<p>The Commission constantly applies the principle of regionalisation recognised at the international level by the world organisation for animal health (OIE) as the most appropriate response to such threats. It is on the basis of this same principle that it requires third countries to react in relation to similar cases emerging in the EU.</p>
<p>In this context, following a Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak reported in Brazil in October 2005, the Commission immediately suspended imports of all kinds of beef (except heat treated meat) from the Brazilian States of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and Sao Paulo. The disease initially affected the State of Mato Grosso do Sul and extended further to Paraná. The State of Sao Paulo was not affected by FMD, but taking into account the movement pattern of livestock and the epidemiological links between these three states, the Commission together with the Member States decided, as a precautionary measure, to also suspend the imports from this latter State. Only heat treated (&gt;80°C) meat products are still authorised as this treatment ensures the inactivation of the virus. The Commission would like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that no FMD outbreak has occurred within the regions approved by the EU for imports into the EU.</p>
<p>Only imports from the non-infected areas of Brazil continue but subject to the standing import conditions that apply to Brazil. Considering that these limit imports to de-boned and maturated bovine meat (this ensures the inactivation of the FMD virus) without offal, it is considered at this stage that the measure is sufficient and proportionate to maintain our level of protection. Furthermore, the EC has requested from Brazil additional guarantees within the health certificate in relation to vaccination and contact with animals of lower status due to the deficiencies found in the latest mission inspections carried out in this country. The Commission wishes to point out that it is determined to see the Brazilian authorities fully complying with these guarantees. Failure to do so will trigger further Commission action.</p>
<p>The Commission is very closely monitoring the evolution of the animal health situation in Brazil and a further mission inspection has recently taken place. The outcome of this mission will be of the utmost importance in order to further assess the situation in Brazil. The Commission wishes to assure the Honourable Member that it will take all necessary measures to ensure that the EU market is fully protected against any risk likely to emerge in this context.</p>
<p>The latest figures accounting for the amount of imports of meat of bovine animals from Brazil into the European Union (EU25) are 168,004 tonnes in 2004 and 175,833 tonnes in 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0636"></a>

<p>(EN) In the first part of the question, the Honourable Member lists three principles concerning football media rights that the Honourable Member extracted from Commission decisions and on which the Commission will briefly comment.</p>
<p>First, it is correct that the Commission has allowed clubs to jointly sell broadcasting rights under certain conditions. The reasons why the Commission considered this to be in compliance with EC competition law (and beneficial for consumers) can be found, e.g., in the Commission decision concerning the joint selling of UEFA Champions League rights<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission would also like to note that the risk that “football clubs raise prices excessively” referred to by the Honourable Member, also exists where football clubs market their rights individually (e.g., in Spain), in particular for football media rights of the top clubs.</p>
<p>Second, the “no single buyer rule” referred to by the Honourable Member was to date only imposed by the Commission in the FA Premier League case (and not, e.g., in the UEFA Champions League case) due to the specific circumstances of the case. This rule therefore does not constitute a general principle.</p>
<p>Third, it is correct that the Commission insists to split up football media rights into several separate packages in order to allow a larger number of competitors to acquire the rights.</p>
<p>In the second part of the question, the Honourable Member inquires about the economic impact of the Commission decisions on football media rights and asks whether the Commission undertakes to carry out an economic analysis of these decisions. The Commission believes that the economic impact of the decisions has been significant. While the Commission cannot, at this stage, undertake to carry out further ex post economic analyses of the decisions, it is important to note that the Commission took into account the economic impact of the decisions prior to their adoption. Also, the Commission and the national competition authorities will continue to closely monitor the sector of football media rights and may intervene where it is deemed necessary. Finally, the Commission is committed to put increasing emphasis on economic analysis in its decision-making process in EC competition law cases as is reflected, e.g., in the creation of the office of the Chief Economist in 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 24 February 2005, on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties, applies the principle of Mutual Recognition to the enforcement of financial penalties in a Member State other than the one in which such a financial penalty has been imposed. In other words, it aims to facilitate the cross-border recognition and enforcement in the EU of decisions, within the scope of article I of the Framework Decision, which impose a financial penalty upon conviction for an offence.</p>
<p>Therefore, parking fines and/or road taxes which can not be executed in the Member State in which they were imposed can be executed in the Member State where the person against whom a decision has been passed has property or income, is normally resident, or in the case of a legal person has its registered seat, if they fall within the scope of article I of the Framework Decision.</p>
<p>However, the obligation to execute a financial penalty which falls within the scope of the Framework Decision is not an absolute one, as it contains optional grounds of non- execution or non-recognition for the executing Member States. Finally, Article 20 contains possibilities for temporarily limiting the scope of the instrument as regards decisions and as regards the applicability to legal persons.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to inform the Honourable Member that the Member States have to transpose the obligations of the Framework Decision in their internal legal order by 22 March 2007. In view of this, the Commission will be in a better position to consider whether there is need for proposing further legislative measures for dealing with the problem of unpaid fines in the EU after the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties has been transposed by the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Sport is a key area not only for health and physical development but also for the education and development of children, young people and adults. It therefore performs a social function and its social and pedagogical values play a crucial role. Among the values that sport needs to transmit are equality - with regard to race, origin, religion or gender - and non-discrimination, particularly at major sporting events that are at the centre of attention for public opinion.</p>
<p>The Wimbledon tennis tournament is a grand slam event where there is no equality between men and women. This is the only tournament where there is still a difference in the prize money awarded to men and to women and where women are discriminated against, winning EUR 42 000 less than the men.</p>
<p>In accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of the EC Treaty on gender mainstreaming, together with Article 141 on equality between men and women in the area of work and employment and Article 13 on discrimination based on sex at the workplace and elsewhere, does the Commission not believe that the EU should take steps to put an end to this inequality in an EU Member State, bearing in mind that it reflects a form of discrimination which does not deserve to be socially perpetuated?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="middle"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>(FR) Article 2 of the Treaty states that one of the Community’s objectives is to promote equality between men and women. Article 3 enshrines the principle of equality between men and women in all of the Community’s fields of action. These principles are also enshrined in Articles 21 and 23 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>According to the established case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (CJEC), sport falls within Community law when it is an economic activity within the meaning of the economic freedoms of the Treaty<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and pursuant to Article 2 thereof. According to the CJEC<a href="#defann_48_2" name="refann_48_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, therefore, the participation of a high-level sports person in an international competition is likely to involve the provision of several different services which may fall within the meaning of Article 59 of the Treaty, even if some of those services are not paid for by those receiving them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 141 of the EC Treaty obliges the Member States to ensure ‘that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied’. Community law also includes a number of directives aimed at implementing the principle of equal treatment for male and female workers<a href="#defann_48_3" name="refann_48_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the situation mentioned by the honourable Member does not appear to fall within the scope of Article 141 and the law deriving from it, given that tennis players do not have an employment relationship with the tournament organisers, but rather their activity is more one of service provider.</p>
<p>Finally, on 13 December 2004, the Council adopted Directive 2004/113 implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services. This directive is aimed at establishing a framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of gender in the access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services, with a view to implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the Member States.</p>
<p>According to Article 4 of the directive, the principle of equal treatment between men and women means: a) there shall be no direct discrimination based on sex, including less favourable treatment of women for reasons of pregnancy and maternity; b) there shall be no indirect discrimination based on sex. Recital 16 of the directive states that differences in treatment may be accepted only if they are justified by a legitimate aim. Directive 2004/113/EC must be transposed into Member States’ legislation by no later than 21 December 2007.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the situation raised by the honourable Member is not liable to be covered by Article 141 of the Treaty and the law deriving from it, but only by Directive 2004/113/EC. Nevertheless, given that the time limits for transposition of the said directive have not yet come to an end, the situation in question must be considered in accordance with the applicable national law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In her question the Honourable Member refers to the movement within the Community of excise products by travellers on which excise duty has been paid in one Member State. This type of movement is regulated by Directive 92/12/EEC<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which, for tax purposes, makes a distinction between the movement of excise goods by private individuals purchasing excise products for their personal use, and movement for commercial purposes. Under the principles of the internal market, private individuals who acquire excise products in a Member State for their own use, and transport these products to another Member State, shall only have to pay the excise duty in the Member State where the products were purchased.</p>
<p>Certain criteria, including guide levels for each type of excise product are laid down with a view to distinguishing between commercial movements and transactions for personal use. These guide levels, however, should not be compared with import quota as referred to by the Honourable Member, and are solely used as a form of evidence or 'indicative limits' to make the above distinction. For movements within the Community, no import quotas apply as any person is free to buy, possess or move alcohol products without any restriction as long as they are for his personal use</p>
<p>As no import quotas exist between Member States, the Commission can not comment on the possibility to either review, or reduce such quotas specifically for alcohol. However, the Commission has put forward a proposal to simplify and liberalise the rules on intra-EU movements of products (mainly alcohol) on which excise duty has already been paid in a Member State<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> providing for abolition of the guide levels referred to above. In the view of the Commission, such levels, on their own, can not be used as evidence that excisable products are being held for commercial purposes, nor should they be interpreted as tax-free 'threshold' (or import quota). It is simply within the jurisdiction of the Member States to establish the guidelines given to officers to determine the situation when checks should be carried out on excise movements.</p>
<p>As to the health issue related to the consumption of alcohol, the Commission in 2004 presented its Report on the rates of excise duty applied on alcohol and alcoholic beverages<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which concluded that the majority of Member States usually do not take into account health policy considerations when they fix their rates, even though the present EC legislation, fixing only minimum rates, offers them substantial room for manoeuvre to integrate public health considerations in their tax policies.</p>
<p>The Commission takes the harm caused by alcohol abuse very seriously. Later in 2006, the Commission is to adopt a Communication on Alcohol and Health, which will establish an EU strategy to support Member States to reduce alcohol related harm. This Communication will address the adverse health effects related to harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption, as well as the related social and economic consequences. It is expected to focus on the following main issues: protection of young people, children and the unborn child; reduction of injuries and death from alcohol-related road accidents; prevention of alcohol-related harm among adults; information and education on the impact of alcohol; developing a common evidence base at EU level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) When the Community concludes an international agreement or adopts a financial instrument it is bound to respect international law, including norms of customary international law. The Commission sees to it that its proposals for such Community instruments are in conformity with the applicable rules of international law; this is inherent in the legal vetting all Commission proposals go through before being sent to Council and Parliament. In the implementation phase, the Commission can only finance projects the purposes of which are in line with the agreement or financial instrument in question. If a third country implements such projects in a manner that violates international law and thereby the agreement or financial instrument on which it is based, the Commission has the full right under Community law to suspend the project and to recover those expenses which have been spent in contravention of the project conditions.</p>

The aim of the reflection process on trade defence instruments is to check that these instruments produce overall the most efficient results in terms of competitiveness for the EU, including for EC producers having relocated outside Europe. Another aim is to check that they do not disproportionably affect economic operators and people who are not engaged in unfair trade practices, such as poor families in developing countries.</p>

<p>(EN) As far as honey is concerned, at the time of the relevant inspection of the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), import into the EU was still allowed.

<p>As regards pig meat, the FVO found that this meat was intended for supplying ships sailing international waters and this is not forbidden by Community legislation. The FVO did not find evidence that pork was illegally imported from Brazil into the EU. As a consequence, no action has been necessary to this date. In this regard it is worth mentioning that Community legislation obliges Member States to collect and destroy catering waste from international means of transport such as ships or planes.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to reassure the Honourable Member that EU food safety rules currently into force are designed to ensure that imported products meet the same standards as those produced in the EU and are also in line with relevant international standards.</p>

<p>On 14-15 December 2005 the European Council decided to accept the proposal put forward by Commission President Mr Barroso and establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.

<p>(EN) Article 2 of the Commission’s proposal for a Regulation for a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, sets out the Intervention Criteria for the Fund. Under Art. 2a, Greece, like any other EU Member State could benefit from the Fund in cases where due to structural changes in world trade patterns 1000 workers are made redundant in a company, including upstream suppliers and downstream producers. Given the relation between the number of jobs in large companies, and the up- and downstream companies, it is possible that a magnitude of around 350 jobs being lost in a large company will render an application for assistance under the Fund possible; this is based on the assumption that up to twice as many jobs can be lost in up- and downstream companies, including Small and Medium Enterprises(SMEs).</p>
<p>Under Art. 2a, the Fund only intervenes in cases where the redundancies occur in a region where the unemployment level is higher than the EU or national average. Eurostat data from 2004 shows that 44 (out of 54) Greek departments (Nome) would be covered under this eligibility criterion, with the notable exceptions of Athens, Rodopi, Karditsa, Fthiotida, Korinthia, Lakonia, Messinia, Kyklades, Irakleio and Chania.</p>
<p>Under Art. 2b, the Fund can intervene when in a given sector over a period of 6 months there have been 1000 redundancies, and where these redundancies represent at least 1% of regional employment measured at NUTS II level. Under this Article particularly workers of SMEs can receive support from the Fund.</p>
<p>The draft opinion of the Parliament's Committee for Employment and Social Affairs on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund proposed the introduction of a 'Safeguard clause' to cover cases in which the criteria under Art. 2a and 2b are not met entirely, but where there is a very serious impact on the local economy. The Commission will consider this proposal in the forthcoming negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0670"></a>

<p>This proposal now passes to Member States in the Council, who have one month to consider it for adoption. The binding deadline for the publication of any definitive measures in the Official Journal of the European Union is 6 October 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware of the issues of children shoes and Special Technology Athletic Footwear (STAF). The above proposal for definitive measures includes children’s shoes. This decision was taken in the light of the multiple comments received from the parties concerned on the provisional measures (which excluded children shoes). There are compelling reasons for the inclusion of children shoes, not least the fact that there is a substantial production of children shoes in the Community. In this respect it is worth noting that during the validity of the provisional measures there were very likely false customs' declarations and probably fraud concerning imports of children shoes in order to circumvent the provisional anti-dumping duty.</p>

<p>In Vienna in June, a letter of intent concerning construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline was signed by the energy ministers of the five States involved in the project. Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs also attended the signing and described the implementation of the project as being of fundamental importance. From the point of view both of the security of energy supply and diversification of transit facilities and sources of supply, the construction of the pipeline, with a capacity of between 20 and 30 billion cubic metres per annum, could represent a huge gain for the European Union, which faces challenges in the field of energy. As the Nabucco project currently has no real competitor as a way of expanding the EU's sources of natural gas, what form of aid will the Commission provide in order to ensure that the Nubucco gas pipeline is built as soon as possible? What is the Commission's preliminary timetable for the realisation of the project? In comparison with other projects to supply Europe with gas, how does the Commission rate the probability of the construction of the Nabucco pipeline?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Concerning the financial support to Nabucco, the Commission has already accepted in 2003 and 2005, to co-finance studies for feasibility and engineering of the project at the level of € 6.5 million. On 24 july 2006, the Council and the Parliament decided new guidelines for the transeuropean energy networks where 10 gas projects have been declared as projects of European interest. Nabucco is one of these projects.</p>
<p>With regard to the timetable, the second study started at the beginning of 2006 and should finish by the end of 2007. The Nabucco company plans to commence the construction of the pipeline in 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission is not in a position to comment on the risks linked to the construction of the Nabucco pipeline, however, the Commission considers the Nabucco route essential to connect the EU to new sources in the Caspian sea and Middle East.</p>
<p>On regulatory issues, the Commission lends its support to all projects that will significantly enhance security of supply and within the context of the Energy Community Treaty is developing a general framework to assist developers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0684"></a>

<p>(FR) In its mid-term review of the White Paper on Transport Policy of 22 June 2006<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission announced its intention to present a White Paper in 2008 proposing the creation of a Common European Maritime Space.</p>
<p>The objective of this initiative will be to reduce the delays and costs resulting from the numerous administrative controls and exchanges imposed on short-sea shipping for transport between ports of the Member States of the European Union. This transport is effectively subject to almost the same requirements as transport from third countries, and it is therefore at a disadvantage compared to equivalent land transport.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that it is working on the basis of the facts, the Commission will certainly consult the parties that will benefit from it, such as loaders and transport operators, as well as the administrative authorities at various levels responsible for controls and making use of their results.</p>
<p>The Commission has not yet established the main points of its approach, but an important contribution to this objective will probably be made by the systematic use of advanced positioning and communication technologies harmonised between operators and administrations. These technologies will make it possible to considerably reduce costs and delays. The number of controls will be considerably reduced but their reliability will be greatly improved by focussing them solely on figures previously identified by means of better analysis.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Communication of 22 June 2006 on the transport policy, such an initiative cannot be restricted to maritime transport, but must consider the whole of the logistical chain of which it forms one link. By reducing and harmonising the constraints amongst the different modes of transport, the common European maritime space will contribute to creating a better modal balance of transport.</p>
<p>Since a significant number of administrative authorities will be involved in its implementation, it falls perfectly within the integrated strategy recommended in the Green Paper on Maritime Policy of 7 June 2006<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Judgment C-212/04 of the European Court of Justice and Judgment 18/2006 of the Greek Supreme Court deem the conclusion of successive fixed-term contracts by Greek public sector bodies illegal and abusive, and the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions considered that the petition on this subject by the Association of Editors of Daily Newspapers of Macedonia and Thrace (ESIEM-TH) was well-founded. At the same time, the provisions of Law 3301/2004 and 3388/2005 which give the State the right to refuse to comply with judicial decisions is criticized in the strongest terms. Through Presidential Decrees 81/2003 and 164/2004, PASOK and Nea Dimokratia (ND) governments have flagrantly violated workers' rights and held thousands of private and public sector workers hostage with contracts which are constantly being renewed, even though they cover 'fixed and permanent needs'.

<p>(EN) Greece has notified the Commission that the Directive 1999/70/EC on Fixed-Term Work<a href="#defann_60_2" name="refann_60_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has been transposed through Presidential Decrees 81/2003, 164/2004 and 180/2004.</p>
<p>The Commission has assessed the compatibility of these Decrees with the Directive: Decree 81/2003 did not contain sufficient measures to prevent abuse of successive fixed-term contracts. However, the necessary rules have been put in place as from the entry into force of the other two Decrees. It should be underlined that there is no requirement under the Directive to transpose fixed-term contracts into permanent contracts as long as there are other effective measures to prevent abuse of successive fixed-term contracts. The judgement of the European Court of Justice of 4 July 2006 in case C-212/04 confirms the Commission's assessment.</p>
<p>The Commission's assessment also takes account of the issues raised in a number of complaints and petitions, including the one referred to by the Honourable Member. The Commission has closed all complaints, indicating in particular that remedies to individual claims arising during the period between the deadline for transposition of the Directive and the entry into force of the national transposition rules must be dealt with by the competent national courts.</p>
<p>The Commission has no indications of any new circumstances that would change its position as regards the transposition of Directive 1999/70/EC in Greece. The Commission, therefore, does not intend to take any measures in that respect.</p>
<p>As regards the complex matters raised by Law 3301/2004 and 3388/2005 concerning enforcement of interim rulings the Commission would refer to its reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0537_EN.html">H-0537/06</a>.
