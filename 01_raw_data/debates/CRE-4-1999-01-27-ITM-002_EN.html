<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Fischler and I have today presented a communication to the Commission on the link between agriculture and environmental policy. The communication comes after long and fruitful cooperation between our departments, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Mr Fischler. The political response to the demand for a better environment is currently reforming the way in which the EU makes policy. Integration is the watchword of the process that was set in motion by the Amsterdam Treaty, with the help of the conclusions of the Cardiff and Vienna summits, and integration is a process of which this Parliament has also been a keen supporter.</p>
<p class="contents">Integration can take us further in areas where we are making no progress with traditional environmental policy. The relationship between nature and agriculture is a good example of the fact that it has been difficult to achieve the right balance with the traditional instruments. For too many years now, agricultural policy and environmental policy have each gone their separate ways. In some places, the consequences have been dramatic. Pollution of the groundwater with nitrates and pesticides and erosion and impoverishment in some of Europe's regions are partly the consequence of intensive farming. Other areas are suffering from the marginalisation of agricultural land and depopulation – a development which also has serious consequences for nature and the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside these trends in agriculture, Europe has adopted some ambitious environmental legislation which reflects its citizens" wish to have a cleaner, healthier and more attractive future. However, it has also become clear that the developments in agriculture have in fact made it difficult to ensure compliance with the environmental legislation. Parliament's recent report on the implementation of the nitrates directive was a very good demonstration of this problem. There is therefore every reason to integrate the environment into agricultural policy, and that is precisely the intention of the Commission's proposal for agricultural reform as part of the Agenda 2000 package. That was the one which we presented in March last year, as you know.</p>
<p class="contents">It is as one of the components of this integration project that the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Fischler, and I have today presented a communication on agriculture and the environment to the Commission. The communication aims to demonstrate and stand up for the need to maintain the environmental elements which are included in the Commission's proposal. Anything else would make the governments" calls for integration sound hollow. Before I deal with some of the key elements in Agenda 2000, let me stress that a good deal of Community legislation – including some outside traditional agricultural policy – has a bearing on agricultural production. As I have said, the nitrates directive is a good and well‐known example, but there is also EU legislation on pesticides, genetically modified organisms and consumer protection. Legislation in these three areas is helping to limit the environmental impact of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">But when we turn to purely agricultural policy and the environment, the Agenda 2000 proposal is a key element. In brief, a reform is planned which is so green that agricultural policy and environmental policy will increasingly complement one another. I should like to describe some of the main features.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the guaranteed prices for beef and veal, cereals and milk are being reduced. This price reduction is necessary to create a better balance in the market, but lower product prices are also good for the environment. This part of the proposal gets to grips with the artificially high prices which for years have been partly to blame for the over‐use of sprays, artificial fertiliser and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is proposing that Member States should make the payment of all income support conditional on farmers observing the rules that are required to protect the environment. This will provide a much greater incentive to implement what are ambitious but necessary EU rules in practice, and in this context I would once again mention the nitrates directive, as well as the environmental protection legislation and legislation on pesticides.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, support for particularly environmentally friendly farming methods is being increased as part of the so‐called accompanying measures. This is support for farmers who are willing to make a positive environmental contribution beyond the minimum legal requirements. This may be organic farming, extensification or reforestation. In this respect, the proposal is a consolidation of the pioneering schemes introduced at the beginning of the 1990s by what is known as the MacSharry reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, so‐called ‘national envelopes' are being established for the livestock sector. This expression covers a sum of money which the Member States are free to distribute within the sector as they please. A more environmentally correct distribution might be based on the amount of pasture land a farmer has, rather than providing support in proportion to the number of animals, as is now the case. If used correctly, these ‘envelopes' could help further promote environmentally correct forms of cultivation and reduce the cultivation pressure on sensitive land. I would stress the fact that it will be up to the Member States, and not the Commission alone, to ensure that this takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, it will now be possible for farmers in Natura 2000 areas who have had extra burdens placed on them to share in the aid distributed to less‐favoured areas. This should make it possible to increase the benefits provided by what is a cornerstone in the protection of Europe's environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also remind you that last spring I presented and secured the adoption of a strategy for biodiversity in Europe. This means that by the end of 1999 an action plan will be drawn up on how European agriculture will contribute to safeguarding biodiversity. Agricultural reform is, of course, a precondition for this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">All these building‐blocks of a new agricultural policy go a long way towards what a number of environmental NGOs and a large section of the European Parliament have been campaigning for. It is clear that the Agenda 2000 reform proposal is an unambiguous signal that, from now on, aid will be redirected towards more neutral support for production and more support for the environment. In future, the common agricultural policy will increasingly reward environmental values and responsible farming. Farmers who take up the environmental challenge will have a financial advantage compared with the current system.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture itself, as Mr Fischler has often stressed, has a long‐term interest in a redirection of aid. I expect the outcome of the forthcoming negotiating round of the World Trade Organisation to point in the same direction. It is a positive development in which there is the great challenge of ensuring that environmental aid does not just become a kind of window‐dressing, protecting traditional monetary flows.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are also other long‐term perspectives in the reform. My message is that, if it is adopted, the proposal will lead to greater local influence on policy than is the case today. To a greater extent, agricultural policy will become a matter for our citizens and farmers. Individual countries, regions and districts will be involved in deciding the requirements that will apply in their areas. There will of course be conditions to ensure that existing European and national legislation is respected, but with an opportunity for people to take more account of local circumstances than is possible with very centralised solutions. In fact, this is the principle of subsidiarity in practice. Environmental organisations, local authorities, water companies and other interested groups will be able to sit down together with farmers and discuss how agriculture and the environment should work together to contribute to sustainable development. Brussels will continue to draw the outlines, but the citizens will fill them in.</p>
<p class="contents">This will of course make considerable demands on both citizens and farmers. A dialogue will be created covering everyone's interests. This will give our citizens a great opportunity to influence developments, but they will naturally need to become involved and be willing to accept the responsibility which this brings. It is important that all the EU countries take up this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal, which was put forward in March 1998, has since been discussed in the Agriculture Council together with Mr Fischler. It is far from being adopted, and it would be wrong to say that all the European agriculture ministers were enthusiastic about the prospect of a greener policy. As you know, however, at the June summit in Cardiff, the Heads of State and Government called for agriculture to be one of the policy areas which should lead the way and demonstrate how integration should be carried out in practice. This challenge was renewed and built upon in Vienna, with a request for a report for Helsinki. That report will contain a timetable for gearing agricultural policy further to the environment and will deal with the question of what indicators can be used to measure the state of the environment. This is an important question, because it is difficult to pursue environmental goals if the relationship between agricultural production and the state of the environment cannot be assessed in a way on which there is general agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course a precondition for making progress that the agriculture ministers should reach agreement on the reform package. However, it is not enough to cross our fingers and wait for the outcome. The environment could easily be forgotten in the final dash for cash. I see it as a great personal challenge to ensure that that does not happen, which is why Mr Fischler and I have today presented the communication, which states, amongst other things, that intensive agriculture conflicts with the EU's ambitions for the environment and that a further effort must be made if drinking water and biodiversity are to be safeguarded. The communication also highlights the important role played by organic farming, because it can make a positive contribution to solving these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The agriculture ministers will be held to the instructions given by the Heads of Government in Vienna and at previous summits. Above all, it will be made clear that a reform without environmental progress is not sustainable, either for the environment or in political terms, for that matter. Europe's taxpayers deserve and demand an environmental return on the cheque for EUR 40 billion which they donate to the agricultural sector every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Fischler, I hope that the European Parliament will welcome this initiative and use it to reopen the public debate on agricultural reform and the environment, which is so essential. The long‐term success and acceptance of the reform depend at least as much on a sound environmental profile as on the price of cereals and meat.</p>

In the last few years I believe that significant progress has been made in reinforcing the environmental dimension of the Common Agricultural Policy. I also believe that the 1992 reform was a very important point given its establishment of agri‐environmental and agri‐forestry measures. This Commission communication is heading in the same direction and will reinforce this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one issue which I feel is rather contradictory. If we analyse these proposals for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, now being discussed within Agenda 2000, we find that there is only an increase of 5 % in the amounts intended for agri‐environmental measures. In other words, this is only a very small increase to reinforce the environmental dimension of the CAP, which to a certain extent is in contradiction with the Commission"s current political aim which I support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner to explain why there is only a 5 % increase in the amounts for agri‐environmental measures.</p>

It may be true that expenditure on those environmental measures that are currently summarised under Regulation 20/78 is only rising by a certain amount, but it is also true that this results in a whole range of other, additional expenditure, for instance an extra incentive for extensive beef production. Finally, it must be emphasised that in future all direct agricultural aid payments will be subject to the observance of good agricultural practice, which de facto also means higher environmental requirements and for which absolutely no provision is made under our existing rules.</p>

Nevertheless, I feel the Commission has shown a certain lack of judgment, in that a distinction should be made between measures designed to encourage good practice and simply meeting minimum standards. The arrangements now in place mean that failure to meet minimum standards could lead to farmers not receiving aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to codify these minimum standards clearly. At present, they are scattered throughout Community legislation. However, measures designed to create an incentive are better codified, and in future we are likely to see them in the rural development programmes and then in certain sectoral COMs. For instance, the Commissioner has just mentioned how those who wish to benefit from the ECU 100 extensification premium know they will have to maintain a specific intensity of cattle. These measures are designed as an incentive to improve the quality of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Commission to codify all the standards which will have to be met in order for farmers to qualify for aid. Member States should not have the latitude to act as they see fit. It seems from the Commission"s proposal that it is delegating all its responsibility to the Member States, whereas I feel it is incumbent on the Commission to codify the minimum standards required across the length and breadth of the Community.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Colino Salamanca for the statements he has made. But let me clarify the Commission"s point of view again. Firstly, we have to distinguish in the proposals between measures that are obligatory and those that are voluntary, meaning first of all those that are obligatory or voluntary on the part of the farmer. So the point is that the farmer is guaranteed the same level of direct payments, which correspond to compensatory payments, but that these will be subject to the general requirement of what is called gross compliance, which the Member States are indeed required to impose.</p>
<p class="contents">It will no doubt prove possible under the implementing provisions also to coordinate the level of these requirements in such a way as to avoid any bias. The second aspect is the voluntary payments, which must go beyond normal practice. That is one of the conditions of eligibility for such payments in the first place. But here too it is clear that they are a component of the second pillar, namely rural development policy. After all our proposal is that we must have a rural development policy of this kind for every rural region. But the proposals also specify that a programme will only be accepted if it definitely incorporates an ‘agri‐environmental measures" heading. Seen from that aspect, I believe our proposals to a very large extent satisfy your requirements.</p>

Secondly, I find it very sensible for you to say that the second pillar should contain an environment‐based programme, but the funding is very low. How do you propose to help the rural areas with this kind of structural programme? Thirdly, when you, or Mrs Bjerregaard, refer to subsidiarity I wonder how this is to be achieved if we do not have any framework conditions at European level. That is not subsidiarity, it is giving free rein. Two small examples: in set‐aside land you allow chemical industrial raw materials to be used in farming but you do not allow vegetables to be grown for animal feed. My other example ...</p>

On the first part: Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I often agree with you but on this point I do not agree that price reductions, in fact the reduction of guarantee prices, automatically triggers more intensive farming. We had the opposite experience with the 1992 reform. If you look at the trend in expenditure on fertilisers, pesticides and so forth between 1992 and 1998 you will find that it fell rather than rose.

In my introduction just now, I said that ‘agricultural policy will become a matter for our citizens and farmers. Individual countries, regions and districts will be involved in deciding the requirements that will apply in their areas. There will of course be conditions to ensure that existing European and national legislation is respected, but with an opportunity for people to take more account of local circumstances than is possible with very centralised solutions.'

As regards the fundamental issue of animal nutrition, the derogation in this proposal that allows 10 % conventional feed to be used is quite sufficient.

We must draw a very careful distinction here: what is conventional production, what is integrated production and what is organic farming? They are three different categories. As you know – and, Mrs Barthet‐Mayer, we recently discussed this in Parliament – the Commission proposed Community‐wide guidelines that would also protect animal products, so as to establish a common, Europe‐wide standard for the definition of organic products. This proposal has now been on the table for some years and the Council of Agriculture Ministers is currently discussing it in detail – the most recent discussions were at the December Council – but to date it has not managed to reach a unanimous view. There are a few sensitive aspects involved which, in my view, need further discussion, without accepting any watering down of the core question, namely the definition of what is actually meant by organic products; one specific aspect you addressed in this connection is the use of conventional feed and of feed containing GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a question that is currently being discussed at another level, in connection with the revision of Regulation 220/90, and I believe we must endeavour to take a more balanced look at any measures that can lead to clearer consumer information.</p>

Neither of us accept non‐compliance with environmental legislation. We are framing the policy in such a way that it is feasible. We are both of the confirmed opinion that it is feasible, and that it is possible for us to secure some sensible decisions in the Member States.

How can they compete against countries from which we import products which are not ecological, not produced by poor farmers but by the worst and most appallingly intensive exploitation of the soil and animals? And how can they farm ecologically – I know many who do in Greece – when they face enormous problems in marketing their products, marketing which receives no aid under our regulations?</p>

Obviously, it is desirable that this percentage should be increased, but we have of course concentrated on many other things. Let me say this loud and clear: I believe that the citizens of Europe want clean water. They are not willing to accept a situation in which the water they drink is not clean. They cannot understand why it should be impossible to formulate a sensible agricultural policy and at the same time to have clean water. We believe it is possible, and that is why we have put forward these proposals and also why we maintain that the environmental legislation must be observed at the same time that we have sensible agriculture in Europe.

Especially important, where agricultural policy is concerned, is the protection of rivers, seas and lakes, as has been mentioned here. There has obviously been progress, in that compliance with environmental standards is being made a direct condition of income support, but, on the other hand, it should be clear as day that aid is to be paid only when the regulations are being observed. But we should be happy to have come this far. Now the question arises as to how Member States will respond to what is, to my mind at least, a step forward: how shall we monitor it? Will we need a long transition period? And how should the matter be treated? Should we have recourse, for example, to an agricultural code of practice, to be used as an instrument of comparison in relation to established policy, and only after that grant direct income support?</p>

My first question is: can the environment be protected while the countryside is being abandoned, and why therefore is this reform heading in this direction?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is: how can the protection of the environment be promoted by spending 50 % of the budget on this 5 % of the population, which will shortly be 2.5 %? In particular, aid for production just encourages producers to use every intensive production method available. This does not protect jobs, quality, the environment or safety. How can the Commissioner reconcile the policy which he claims to want to implement with the abandonment of the countryside and payments for production? Moreover ...</p>

To be fair, you would have to compare it with total public expenditure. If you add the national budgets to the Community budget and then deduct the agricultural part, you obtain a percentage of 2 % for 5 % of the population. I do not think that is really excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on jobs in agriculture, there is only one thing I can say to you. The more environment‐friendly our farming is, the more jobs that will imply and not the reverse. So this proposal to incorporate environmental aspects more firmly in the reform is certainly in the interests of agriculture and of jobs. But there is one thing you must not forget. If we are going to discuss making these additional demands on European agriculture, and in fact considerably higher demands than we make on our overseas competitors, then we must also be prepared to pay for it. And we also have to stop arguing that agricultural reform must not cost anything!</p>

In reply to a written question of mine, the Commission said recently that there were no uniform rules for sampling groundwater to check whether the directive was being implemented correctly. That seems to me a very feeble basis for monitoring legislation. When is that going to improve?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this: nitrate in groundwater can come from sources other than animal manure. It also comes from artificial fertiliser and from factories, sewage treatment plants and so on. How does the Commission intend to differentiate between nitrate in groundwater from these sources and nitrate from animal manures, so that the burden is not placed entirely on agriculture?</p>

Our job is to monitor whether the Member States are complying with the nitrates directive, which simply means that checks are carried out as to how much nitrate there is in the groundwater. That is what we are doing. That is what we are investigating, and we have found that the areas where there have been particular problems in connection with the nitrates directive are also areas with a high concentration of livestock production, whether it be cattle or pigs, although pigs in particular have caused a great many problems. That is why some countries have had particular difficulties in implementing the nitrates directive. As I said, however, it is not our job to check whether it comes from one source or another, but we must ensure that the directive is complied with.</p>

Tomorrow we take a vote on a pretty important piece of legislation, Mr Kindermann's report on animal welfare. I would like to know how the Commission views the situation. For example, in the United Kingdom, because of animal welfare legislation, the British pig farmer is suffering. In Sweden it is estimated that environmental legislation in their country puts one Swedish kroner per kilogram onto the price of meat. How does the Commission see the protection of European agriculture when it comes to imports from countries which do not have the sort of animal welfare legislation that we have in the European Union? Please, Commissioners, do not use the argument that the consumer will decide. The consumer decides on price. I hope I can get a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, let me point out that it is of course self‐evident that animal protection provisions must be respected. We can never accept, either in agricultural stock‐breeding or in stock‐breeding in general, that the existing laws are infringed. But what we have also made provision for, especially in relation to encouraging investment in agricultural undertakings, is that if a farmer sets up stock‐breeding systems that are particularly kind to animals and invests to that end he will receive greater support than a farmer who is only prepared to observed the minimum standards.</p>

I am, of course, delighted by the cooperation between the two Commissioners on the agriculture/environment problem, but I do wonder about the danger which may emerge as this sector develops in the future, namely the risk of the transfer of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that biodiversity is vital. So I begin to ask questions when I see that the Commission, and Mrs Bjerregaard"s service in particular, has shown it is in favour of using genetic technology and putting genetically modified organisms on the market before there has been any serious evaluation of their impact on biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to know if Mrs Bjerregaard is prepared to reconsider the authorisation that has already been granted to some genetically modified organisms if it later emerges that such authorisation has a negative effect on biodiversity.</p>

Instead, what we have done initially is to try to ensure that everyone who had a need to know was informed, which we did by implementing labelling of the products at a very early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">We then dealt with the second question which was raised, namely the effects of GMOs. Obviously, we are also aware of the connection with biodiversity. This means that in the new proposal which is now before Parliament we are very clear on the question of risk analyses. But we have also dealt with the long‐term effects, which is probably what the question was actually about. We should of course examine what is involved when such products are released into the environment and whether there could be any effects in the long term. We are watching this very closely, and as the questioner perhaps knows, proposal 90/220 contains some provisions which mean that GMO products will not simply be approved for all time, but will be subject to reassessment, because we cannot rule out gaining some experience of the long‐term effects or obtaining some new information. So, all in all, we are trying to be as careful as we possibly can, and I am also looking forward to the discussion which I will clearly have with Parliament in February.</p>
