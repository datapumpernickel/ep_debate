Fortunately, that is now over, and this proud and wonderful Ethiopian people can once again start deciding on its own fate. Sadly, we are forced to note that human rights are being violated, that people are being tortured and locked up in prisons at random, and that students are calling for academic freedom, to no avail. This is painful. As international community, we have concluded a partnership deal. We will sign this as ‘the Cotonou Agreement’. In that document, we aim to establish good relations by entering into a dialogue with each other. This also applies specifically to Ethiopia, a country which time and again appears on the list of countries which quality for emergency aid. I hope that we, along with Ethiopia, can now finally turn over a new leaf, and that Ethiopia will be prepared – and I believe we should press for this, Commissioner – to free the people who are behind bars at present, because they are human rights activities, namely Messrs Woldemariam, Nega and Lidetu Ayalew, to allow students to return to their campuses in complete freedom and to observe the fundamental freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in fact, possible within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">That is done in a country, Ethiopia, which is occupying an important position in East Africa. It has, under Mengistu, experienced a horrific period, and has, following a fierce civil war, eventually found peace. Ethiopia is being governed by people originating from the resistance movement. At times, they still display characteristics of a certain ‘bush’ mentality and find it difficult to share power with others, as it were. Tigreans play a major role in the government and do so very expertly. The government also plays a crucial role in a number of peace-promoting initiatives, but is, at the same time, struggling to achieve good relations in Ethiopia, in its interaction with Eritrea, and also within Eritrea. Attempts are being made to build a regional autonomy within the countries, coupled with a certain level of ethnicity, with respect for minorities. This is a painstaking process and is also often accompanied by resistance from certain groups within Ethiopia. We simply have to establish that it is still costing them a great deal of effort in order to build a more powerful, stable democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way, I appreciate the efforts that this is costing them. At the same time, however, we as international community can hardly ask anything else from them here than that they understand that if they do not observe human rights, do not show respect for groups who think differently, react with violence and violate human rights, this will eventually seriously damage their own status and our position, as well as our chance to support them. I believe we need to operate within that context of understanding and insight, and must also be very clear. That is why we will give our unqualified support to this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The end of the military dictatorship, the peaceful separation of Eritrea and the formation of a government of national unity turned the country at the time into a fine example of a successful transition from dictatorship to democracy. Unfortunately, this image has been brutally shattered. The bloody border conflict with Eritrea, the government’s inability to prevent another famine and the repression of the past couple of weeks have seriously compromised Ethiopia’s image. It is correct that unemployed young people have taken advantage of the student protests earlier this month to start plundering, but that in no way justifies the excessively harsh police action which claimed at least 30 lives. Neither does it justify the gulf of repression during which students, journalists, human rights activities and opponents were rounded up and accused of inciting violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethiopia is facing two fundamental problems: firstly, the government’s insubstantial ethnic basis, and secondly, poverty. As far as the first problem is concerned, an inter-Ethiopian dialogue must be established urgently, representing all political and ethnic groups. Europe can play a crucial role in this. As for the second problem, the Ethiopian government must pledge its unconditional support to a peace agreement with Eritrea, so that the necessary funds for development are no longer diverted to defence expenditure and weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have well-attested reports of the discovery of 2000 mass graves, of the arrest of senior officers of the <span class="italic">gendarmerie,</span> of inquiries into an organisation known as the Operational Command and generally matters of real concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been put to us that what is required is: an independent commission of inquiry to shed light on human rights violations, acts of torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions, a commitment to protect adequately human rights defenders and local organisations working on this issue and the appointment of some special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary and arbitrary executions, with the working group on forced or involuntary disappearances being invited as soon as possible to inquire into matters in Cameroon.</p>
<p class="contents">By coincidence, today's <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> has a special supplement on Cameroon, the opening sentence of which tells us that all the evils of Africa are to be found in Cameroon and yet also all the reasons for hope for the better. What has been revealed to us here suggests that both of these propositions are true: both the reasons for hope and the present evils. Also, this week in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> in relation to General Aussaresses we have been reminded that torture, disappearance and evil-doing and the use of humans as means and not as ends in themselves have terribly scarred the history of our own continent, both during the war of 1939 to 1945 and afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not in a position to hold ourselves up as being somehow superior but we can, as concerned human beings, share the concern of our fellows in Cameroon who are raising these points and members of international non-governmental human rights organisations who have been drawing it to our attention. I strongly commend this resolution to the House and hope it will be adopted unanimously this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are referring to disappearances, extra-judicial executions, tortures, mass graves and overcrowded prisons. The special unit that controls banditry, in particular, is reported to indulge in the systematic violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Committee against Tortures called for the swift dissolution of this unit, with good reason, in fact. However, that is not enough, of course. Cameroon suffers from an enormously huge problem of lawlessness. We welcome the fact that the President, Mr Biya, set up an inquiry committee which led to the arrest of a number of suspected officers.</p>
<p class="contents">It will take more than that, however, to restore the confidence in the rule of law, such as an independent inquiry into the disappearances and into the mass graves, and especially into punishing the guilty. Europe could help in this by making resources and expertise available to the legal system in Cameroon.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wanting to let the Cameroon leaders off the hook, I would, by the by, like to draw your attention to one of the fundamental problems of Cameroon and, in fact, of large parts of Africa, namely the dramatic slump in the price of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Oxfam presented a report today in which it is assumed that the reduction in those prices of raw materials costs the developing countries more than the total amount that they receive in development aid. I would therefore urge the Council and Commission to take the recommendation of the Oxfam report seriously, and perhaps we can organise a debate on this issue before long.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at any rate promising that the Belgian Presidency announced today that it wants to make Africa one of its priorities. We welcome this, and will give our full cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All this leads me to believe that the government of Cameroon, and it is perhaps this which worries me most today, no longer has any control over the special forces which it has set up, the special forces which appear to be responsible, among other things, for the disappearance of 9 young people who allegedly stole a cylinder of gas in the Douala sports district.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prove good faith on the part of the government – my colleague said earlier that there were plenty of reasons for hope in Cameroon – I think that we have to go along with the UN proposal to set up a committee, as a matter of urgency, to look into all the extortion, torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions identified over recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, today, Parliament cannot make do with adopting texts which are not respected and verified on the ground, especially as Cameroon has signed the Cotonou Convention of 23 June 2000 requiring that the parties undertake to promote and protect fundamental freedoms and all human rights. We must call on Cameroon to respect this convention and find ways of excluding this country and any other country which violates the conventions which it has signed.</p>

<p class="contents">In order for the Cotonou Agreement to be effective and credible, the European Union needs all the ACP countries, including Cameroon, of course, to use actions to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to democratic values. The governments and in particular the State security forces of all the countries associated with the European Union need to have a clear understanding that security and public order cannot come before the exercise of people’s freedoms, not to mention their physical safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Cameroon is an important country in the regional context, whose indicators paint a hopeful picture of the economic situation, but we are obliged to look beyond this positive outlook and ask the government of Cameroon to make a greater effort to maintain the rule of law and to respect the rights of its population.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we must ask the government of Cameroon to comply with the recommendations of the United Nations, which has already asked it to reform the structure and activity of its security forces, in order to ensure that they are made up of regular members and always act within the limits of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Cameroon must understand that by making this effort, not only will it be satisfying the European Union and the other countries, but it will also be working in the interests of its own people. Also, it is good for the whole of the African continent that European cooperation with Africa, both under the Cotonou Agreement and under bilateral cooperation with our countries, should be governed by respect for the values of freedom that we all profess to share.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by doing what my colleague Mr MacCormick did and also recognise the work and action of some non-governmental organisations such as FiACAT, which has passed on information and concerns to us in its constant monitoring of the situation in Cameroon. We want to encourage local organisations even more, such as ‘Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture’, which are on permanent alert on the ground and have consequently been victims of injustice. They deserve and have our solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People who have lived under totalitarian regimes know how important it is to establish and build on this cornerstone to its fullest capacity in every state. They therefore also understand that manipulation of the press is an assault on democracy. In other words, when the press is compromised and manipulated, or when it loses its political plurality because it is a corporate monopoly, democracy is jeopardised to a high degree. We must therefore not only put our finger on the wound in third countries, in the reform states, in order to foster democratic development by promoting freedom of the press. We must also look at ourselves. I think it is especially important to ask ourselves whether an election can genuinely be described as democratic if a large number of the television channels are compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not also consider whether this is an area where we can make a contribution? I think this applies to Russia as much as the EU Member States. I therefore believe that it is important to include press freedom as an indicator in the human rights report. Press freedom must be part of how we judge the clauses in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, how we judge how close the relations with Ukraine and Russia will be, but also how we judge the development of democracy in our own states.</p>

This freedom is lacking in many dictatorships due to the fear on the part of those in power of informed citizens, debate, opposition and disclosure.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to take a stand in favour of press freedom and those who fight for this, in a consistent manner. Understandably, our attention turns to the developing countries and the former centrally governed countries which are now in transition. This is with good reason, for we can often lend these countries real support with our aid and resources to local NGOs, civil society and the different media involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As Social-Democrats we consider this topic of press freedom to be a cornerstone of our belief. However, within Europe, we would draw your attention to a particularly disquieting phenomenon, namely the concentration of ownership and control of media in Europe in a limited number of countries. That affects diversity in a fundamental way. This becomes even more serious if economic power and political power are combined. That is when freedom is at risk. I do not need to name any names to make myself clear. The European Parliament’s socialist group will take the initiative for proposals which resist this threat of press freedom. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats has announced that, despite the fact that it has taken the initiative for this resolution, it refuses to back this resolution. In fact, it has threatened to vote against this resolution if this section were to be adopted. Does the power, or the fear, of the aforementioned person extend so far that he already has the People’s Party in his clutches? We would ask the People’s Party to consider urgently whether it would like to defend press freedom or the concentration of power. It will make for an interesting outcome of the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The debate is the result of an initiative for a resolution taken by the group of the European People's Party. When the world day of the freedom of the press was held on 3 May, we were anxious to show our solidarity with the journalists who fell victim to their own dedication during 2000, 36 of whom died and a further 77 of whom were imprisoned while on the job.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware here, to scorn the freedom of the press is to attack human dignity, violate man's quest for truth and thwart his full potential and we wanted to express this in the simplest terms possible. Unfortunately, this very simple idea was hijacked by other political groups, as Mr van den Berg has just told us, who used the occasion to restart a pseudo-political argument with one of our colleagues and a future leader of one of the fifteen Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, although I instigated the initial project, because the calendar of plenary sessions has been cut and we are all forced to run around like headless chickens here in Strasbourg, I was unable to attend the conciliation meeting which resulted in the joint resolution which is about to be put to the vote. At the time I was in the House taking part in the very important debate on the future of the Middle East. A small majority of honourable Members has dictated that we cannot be in two places at once, a fact which I cannot but deplore.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why – because I would have opposed the paragraph which has now been included in the joint resolution – I asked our fellow members in the group not to sign this joint resolution and to put the initial text of our resolution to the vote in all its simplicity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that everything that has happened regarding this resolution has left me somewhat disconcerted and also highly perplexed. General Morillon has just reminded us that, as the European People’s Party, we had decided on this initiative on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May. I think it is an excellent initiative because it supports those who commit themselves on a daily basis to the fight for freedom and put their own lives at risk to tell the world what is happening in vast areas of the Least Developed Countries or even – it is worth remembering – in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Then something absolutely regrettable happened. Someone thought of exploiting this excellent initiative for their own ends, bending it to a partisan political position, a political position that has emerged too often in this House, in my opinion. I do not even want to waste words on this. Last Sunday, 18 million Italians gave their answer. I just want to see the result of all this. The likely result is that a fine, important testimonial will lose much of its importance because of the aloof detachment of the world of the media, which prefers to report conflict rather than the exchange of ideas. Above all, the role of this institution has been renounced and less and less respect is shown for politics. We only believe in the politics of values and the exchange of ideas; we do not believe in the politics of venom. Venom has never produced anything in history, and in general it has never rewarded those who have used it. We only believe in positive values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To insist on the principle of the freedom of the press is obviously right and proper, but I remember the comments when the first law on the freedom of the press was passed in the Soviet Union. The journalists then asked: who will give us the money to publish newspapers? The matter has still not been settled. I mention this problem since our draft resolution notes the decline imposed on the press in Russia and also deplores the attacks on diversity and freedom. I should like to add that the problem of the press is part of the struggle for power. In Russia the press subsidised by millionaires put Mr Yeltsin into the presidency, but the political line of that time is not to the taste of today’s leaders and the same millionaires are now either in the dock or abroad. Freedom of the press certainly played a part in the event, which, nevertheless, is primarily a stage in the struggle for power.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to add that media science increasingly points to the so-called editorial routine as something that affects the free press. Individual journalists accept work where they can find it, and they adapt to the prevailing editorial climate and ideas even when these contrast with their own personal ideas. Turning conformists into saints, however, is not a job that can be regulated by resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, of course, I should like to remind you of point number 10 in the draft resolution concerning conflict of interests, an issue that, as we all know, has been talked about a lot recently on the occasion of the Italian elections. It is said that governments should keep a scrupulous eye on conflicts of interest and ambiguous relations between editors and the proprietor. However, when the president and the proprietor are the same person, what can be done, Mr President? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom of expression and particularly the independence of the media help guarantee and promote democracy in the world. The persecution of journalists in their profession is a sign of incapacity to respect a democratic structure, but this is a rule rather than an exception. Even today, journalists around the world are the subject of censorship, physical sanctions and infringements of personal dignity. In many cases, the journalists involved get killed. The problem lies, of course, in Russia where, since Putin took up office, we have seen fresh developments in Russia’s post-Soviet media market. The trend is clear. The Kremlin is trying to impose its will on Russia’s national networks ORT, RTR and NTV, and to develop an ideology in which the media will only be able to advertise State interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We were able to witness this again recently when on 10 May, the Attorney General burst in on Echo Moscow, a radio station, and confiscated all financial and commercial documents. Where this will end in Russia, we do not yet know, but it is clear that that country’s democracy is in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we also need to keep a watchful eye on democracy in Europe. The President of Italy has been mentioned a moment ago, who owns a company which owns, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, three television channels, as well as the largest national publishing house, which, in turn, publishes magazines that support that politician. I find the initiative of Mr Van den Berg (PSE) an interesting one to contemplate. In fact, we should also be aware that this phenomenon not only occurs in Italy, of course. Maybe in England too, there is a media monopoly, and that is to the advantage of the Social-Democratic government in the light of the pending elections. There are similar developments in other countries too. It seems to me to be a good idea for the European Parliament to look into this issue and to see what it can do about it, for it concerns us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sichrovsky (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, press freedom is undoubtedly one of the bases of any functioning democracy. I believe – also in my capacity as a journalist – that this is summed up very neatly in the motion. Yet if we look at freedom of information, we need to go a step further than simply guaranteeing that every journalist can practise his or her occupation without external influence.</p>
<p class="contents">The public's freedom of information, however, is restricted to some extent even in some countries which guarantee freedom of the press. This is due, for example, to the financial relationships between media owners, but also an absence of journalistic responsibility. For example, it is worrying – even if it does not constitute a direct restriction on press freedom – that some magazines have now set up their various departments, including their political departments, as profit centres, which means that the political editors are now responsible for generating advertising revenue in their sections of the publication.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also implications for press freedom if – as in Austria – a daily newspaper changes the political focus of its reporting when it is saved from bankruptcy by a bank with close links to a particular political party.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further problem in particular, namely the growing tendency to separate information from commentary. The result is a kind of ‘readers' letter’ journalism, which means that even in supposedly independent newspapers, we are tending to find little else but the opinions of journalists who are influenced by the owners and their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to guarantee the right to information, it is essential that there is freedom of information for the general public as well as freedom of the press. As the European Parliament, we have an obligation to monitor compliance with press freedom in all countries of the world. Perhaps we should respect the public's right to diversity and freedom of opinion to a greater extent in future too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, it should contain a clear call for the protection and guarantee of the freedom to exercise the profession of journalist, threatened as it is – and this is something that Parliament should be aware of – in a part of Europe, the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the political wing of ETA was severely punished at the ballot boxes, and what was its response? The immediate response of this criminal organisation, once again, was to intimidate, threaten and make an attempt on the life of a journalist who was doing nothing more than defending the values on which European society is based, defending peaceful coexistence and defending the freedom of the Basque people.</p>
<p class="contents">The enemies of freedom of expression, of democracy and of life do not deserve to be citizens of the Europe that we are building on such strong foundations as freedom, security and justice for those who live and move around in European territory.</p>
<p class="contents">This, ladies and gentlemen, is the aim of the amendment that my group is tabling and which I hope will receive the support of the political groups in this House, and I also thank Mr Sánchez García for announcing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes the fact that this issue has been tabled for debate here. The Commission took part in a diplomatic representation to the Ethiopian government on behalf of the Union on 26 April, during which it expressed its regret at the loss of life during the riots which took place last month in Adis Abeba and elsewhere in Ethiopia. It also regretted the violent action on the part of the security forces. The diplomatic representation called on the government to clarify recent events by carrying out a comprehensive, neutral investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is concerned, the Commission is still urging both countries to give the peace mission under the patronage of the UN and the OAU their unrestricted support. It expects both governments to guarantee the UN mission full freedom of movement, actively help with mine clearance, release all prisoners of war and internees and start demobilising a large part of its strike forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has supported the efforts of the UN mission by monitoring developments in both countries continuously and maintaining close contacts with the parties involved. It has made declarations proposing the process and – where necessary – voicing its concerns. The Commission thinks this is the best way of supporting the efforts of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission expressly welcomes the initiative of the religious leaders to visit areas on both sides of the border and start a reconciliation process. This decisive process should, in its view, be promoted and shaped by the people concerned. At the present time, the Commission considers a formal summit organised by the international community to be premature.</p>
<p class="contents">On Cameroon, I should like to say that the Commission is monitoring the human rights situation in Cameroon closely and notes that this country has started democratising its society and institutions. There have been very positive developments in the area of human rights and civil freedoms. We also note, however, that the various players still have insufficient knowledge of and fail to respect these new rights properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Cameroon has ratified the convention against torture and was the subject of a report by the committee against torture presented in November 2000. In addition, a national committee on human rights and fundamental freedoms has been set up in Cameroon, albeit with restricted functions, and a regional centre for the promotion of human rights has been set up in collaboration with the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community has supported Cameroon within the framework of the Lomé Convention with a grant of EUR 6 million for institutional reform in the area of the rule of law, democratisation and respect for human rights. It has also examined a support programme in the area of the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="contents">We are supporting reform of the justice system and stronger responsible leadership of the institutions in coordination with Bretton Woods, with a special endowment from the preliminary financial framework of the ninth European Development Fund. Specific funding is also being granted under the ninth European Development Fund in order to support non-state players, especially associations and non-governmental organisations working in the government and to promote human rights and strengthen the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the Cotonu agreement, the Commission is pursuing a positive approach based on dialogue and does not feel that there is any justification for starting consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonu agreement. The situation is being monitored on the ground together with the Member States. The government has set up a committee of inquiry, the findings of which will be carefully analysed by the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say on the last topic in this human rights debate that freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press are, without doubt, absolutely vital to a democratic society and that the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion can only be exercised where there are several media. Where this is not the case, there is either no democracy at all or democracy is under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Threats to the freedom of the press and freedom of opinion throughout the world are one of the most distressing aspects of our international work. Like Parliament, the Commission also takes rampant persecution and the repression of freedom of opinion and the freedom of the press very seriously. It starts with conditions in the media, as some members of the House have described in connection with Russia, and ends with terrorist attacks on journalists, as reported yesterday from the Basque country. However, I am in the happy position of being able to tell the House that the Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, the youngest brother of the Director-General of the Commission responsible for enlargement, has survived the attack. He is seriously injured but, thank God, he will survive.</p>
<p class="contents">This clearly illustrates that journalists are the target of terrorist tactics because all extremist organisations throughout the world rightly perceive freedom of the media and freedom of opinion as their most serious threat.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to report briefly that the Commission took a position on freedom of opinion, freedom of worship and freedom of belief at the 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. The EU not only represents its point of view on the international stage, it also provides practical help from the Community budget. For example, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights makes provision for considerable sums to support independent media throughout the world. Assistance ranges from training measures for journalists to media monitoring. Over EUR 5 million was provided out of the 2000 budget for projects relating to freedom of opinion, freedom of the media and protection and training for journalists. A major project in Asia and Africa, which is being implemented in collaboration with <span class="italic">Reporters sans Frontières</span>, addresses some of the main risks to which journalists are exposed, as listed in Parliament's resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The project makes provision for an assessment of the situation of imprisoned journalists, financial support for these journalists and their families and information and public awareness campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Support under the European initiative should continue. The call for proposals in January 2001 expressly included the subject of freedom of opinion as one of the priorities.</p>
