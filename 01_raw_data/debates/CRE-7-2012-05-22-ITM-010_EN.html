<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolai Wammen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, Commissioners, honourable Members, the meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 23 May is intended to discuss informally a comprehensive set of measures designed to promote growth and jobs in preparation for the June European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There has not been a discussion in the Council of the informal European Council so I will use this opportunity to provide you with the Presidency’s expectations. There has been much talk about an austerity strategy versus a growth strategy. I would like to make it very clear that this is a false distinction. What we in the Danish Presidency have been working on throughout our period in office is a dual approach where we pursue fiscal discipline and growth at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot create growth if we do not have economic stability. Economic growth will contribute to public finances, and structural reforms will contribute both to consolidation efforts and to increasing growth and competitiveness. I believe that there is a wide agreement among Member States on this dual approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This informal European Council meeting on 23 May will provide an opportunity to focus on the various measures that form part of the EU’s growth agenda. The aim is to inject further momentum into that process. The Danish Presidency warmly welcomes this increased momentum. The meeting will be a stepping stone towards the European Council in June where the Heads of State or Government can be expected to task further work grouped under the following headings:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, mobilising new policies to fully support growth: the informal meeting will be an opportunity to highlight the rapid progress which needs to be made in the Council and in the European Parliament on a number of proposals which have the potential to boost growth. Obvious examples are the Single Market Act and the patent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency has been particularly committed to making progress on these issues. But further efforts are needed, in particular, to help boost employment, and particular attention is also needed to tackle youth unemployment. The Presidency therefore warmly welcomes the Commission’s employment package.</p>
<p class="contents">A further key element to the growth agenda is the external economic policy. Here again, the Presidency, together with the Commission, is preparing for a discussion in June on how to make better use of strategic partnerships in support of our trade and economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, gearing Member States’ policies to growth: it is essential that we continue with the reform agenda, which remains crucial to ensuring job-creating growth. This will be dealt with in more detail in June when we will bring the European Semester to a close and endorse country-specific recommendations to guide Member States in their structural reforms and employment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on financing the economy, we must continue to pursue an approach based on smart fiscal consolidation. That means reducing debt and deficits, but in a way which allows scope for continuing to invest for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of specific initiatives which are likely to be raised at this week’s meeting and which will certainly need to be developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the EIB could be better mobilised to support SMEs and help finance key infrastructure projects. Heads [of State or Government] may be invited to agree to the principle of increasing the banks’ capital and of strengthening existing joint instruments. It is also important that agreement be reached on the project bonds pilot phase, which we hope to achieve at our negotiations with Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Structural Funds should be better focused on competitiveness and convergence. For the current funds, this means reallocation with an emphasis on SMEs, youth training and employment. We shall make sure that the EU’s future budget, including cohesion, is targeted to sustain and develop growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting tomorrow is informal. There will be no preparatory discussions in the Council and no formal conclusions. The purpose will be to agree on principles and ideas for generating growth in Europe. Let me underline that the Danish Presidency has, from the very first day, consistently stressed the overriding priority which is attached to putting Europe back on the growth track. It has been the focus of the informal European Council in January, the European Council in March, and now again in May and June. We have been working hard to ensure rapid adaptation of relevant legislation. We are grateful that this objective is shared by Parliament and that we have enjoyed constructive cooperation. But now we need to take the next steps, and that is the task ahead for the Council, for this Parliament and for the Commission. We need to work together to secure growth and jobs in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, let me first say on behalf of President Barroso that he very much wanted to be here today to have this debate with you. However, his attendance at the G8 and the NATO meeting in Chicago made it impossible for him to be back from the US in time.</p>
<p class="contents">On his behalf and with the team, together with my colleagues, Michel Barnier and László Andor, let me outline to you the Commission’s action plan for growth and jobs with a view to tomorrow’s informal summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we find ourselves at a turning point in the debt crisis. At the same time, the European Union is now witnessing a new level of debate about growth and how precisely to achieve growth, which is definitely positive and indeed necessary. From the outset, the Commission has insisted on a twin-track policy response that combines both stability and growth. From the outset, we have combined concrete proposals for stability with concrete proposals for growth. The Commission is grateful that this House has supported those ideas since very early on. It is very good news that the Member States are now also more willing to take action in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I see tomorrow’s dinner of Heads of State or Government as an opportunity to seize the moment for growth, and as a major stepping stone to the European Council at the end of June 2012. On 30 May, i.e. between the two Councils, the Commission will present its country-specific recommendations, addressing the specific economic challenges facing each and every Member State as well as the Union generally. On 30 May, we will also set our line on implementing the Stability and Growth Pact in a growth-friendly and differentiated way, applying its inbuilt scope of judgment, which focuses on the structural sustainability of public finances over the medium term and takes into account the fiscal space and macro-economic conditions of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We will use these opportunities in the summits to urge Member States to deliver on the commitments they have made to strengthen stability, implement structural reforms and boost sustainable growth and employment. We will urge Member States to continue to build the bedrock of economic stability. Pursuing sound public finances is really not an option but a necessity. We can never have sustainable growth as long as we have an unsustainable debt. We are starting to see a rebalancing of our economy. Deficits are falling across Europe. There is simply no other way to build confidence and cut borrowing costs. Every euro spent on servicing debt is a euro less for jobs and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Schuman Day statement two weeks ago, the Commission called for accelerated implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which has been endorsed by each and every Member State as a means of accelerating action for jobs and growth in the short term. This will be the key message President Barroso will bring to tomorrow’s informal European Council. He will urge the Heads of State or Government to back a growth initiative that will serve as a catalyst for faster and more robust economic recovery. The Commission will present this in more detail before the June European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also remind you that the Europe 2020 strategy is the agenda for the long-term health and sustainability of our economy. Meeting its climate and energy targets alone could create up to five million new jobs in Europe, putting almost a quarter of our unemployed people into work. But Europe 2020 must be for today as well as for tomorrow. With the right political pressure, we can start to make a difference today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you just two very concrete and very topical examples. First, we have asked Member States to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate with third parties on tax evasion and fraud. National treasuries lose revenues through tax evasion, and these are losses they simply cannot afford. Twenty-five Member States want the European Union to move ahead in these negotiations, while two again blocked the measure at the last ECOFIN Council at a cost of potentially tens of billions of euro for European taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example: we need to step up the pace of trade negotiations with the key global partners. If Europe is to grow, it needs to ride the wave of global growth. Our exports to Korea, for instance, shot up by 20% last year – 2011 – following the entry into force of our free trade agreement. There are many more opportunities out in the world economy and we must do all we can to seize them.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, there are many measures that we can take quickly to strengthen our economies and send a message of confidence. Promoting public and private investment is a cornerstone of our growth initiative. We will, first of all, propose that Member States commit a further EUR 10 billion to the European Investment Bank. This could unleash many times that amount in new investment. The EIB could expand its lending volume, which is a quick and effective way of channelling badly needed stimulus to the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that this is a proposal which President Barroso put before this House on 28 September 2011, in his State of the Union address. Now there is momentum to get it off the ground, with a focus on financing innovative and competitive small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in countries and regions where such financing is most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB and the Structural Funds can also be used more effectively through limited risk sharing with private investors. We welcome, too, the excellent progress in the negotiations with Parliament and the Council recently on our project bond proposal, and we look forward to an agreement in the trialogue meeting later today. We estimate that the project bonds could unlock up to EUR 4.6 billion of investment in infrastructure and innovation already in a pilot phase.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also urge immediate agreement on our growth-focused budget for next year, 2013, with agreement by the end of the year on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2014 to 2020. This will be an important signal of Europe’s readiness to invest in its future: in job-rich green growth and innovation-based reindustrialisation in Europe. And, in truth, the MFF is our Marshal Plan for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We will look at further optimising the use of the Structural Funds. We want to invest them better and use the funds as catalysts to boost sectors such as renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also continue to work for a swift adoption of the financial transaction tax proposal which the Commission put forward last September and on which you are voting, I think, tomorrow or the day after. In June, we will bring forward new detailed proposals on how its EUR 57 billion a year of revenue could be used for targeted investment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the structural side, there are many things we can do that cost little but can have a major impact on our economy. The single market for goods has opened up vast opportunities for economic dynamism but we must be blunt and honest here: it is incomplete and unbalanced. It does not currently work for services, and that penalises those Member States that most urgently need to catch up. It is also failing to bring out the full potential of the digital economy.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso will tomorrow urge the Heads of State or Government to implement the Single Market Act quickly, starting with the European patent, which must be adopted in June. It is high time to clear the way for the bright innovators of today to become Europe’s successful entrepreneurs of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the leadership of Michel Barnier, and in order to keep up the pressure for implementation, the Commission will present a single market governance scoreboard in June, as well as proposals to get more out of the Services Directive. In addition, whilst pursuing the growth agenda, we must address the social emergency that many Europeans face today with the same determination with which we address the economic challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Andor is steering our work in this field, where our focus is on Europe’s most immediate social challenges. The most pressing challenge is, of course, unemployment, and especially youth unemployment, which, in some countries, is at intolerable levels. In January, the President announced the creation of action teams to mobilise efforts in the eight Member States with the highest proportion of young people out of work. He will present the results of these efforts tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking beyond the immediate horizon, I believe that a long-term perspective on the future of economic and monetary union is necessary to keep us all moving in the right direction. Therefore, we need to reflect on what kind of European Union would be required to deepen economic and political integration – for instance, so that joint issuance of debt would make sense for all Member States sharing the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November’s Green Paper on stability bonds will be followed up soon, ideally with a medium-term to long-term road map that outlines the deeper fiscal and economic integration necessary in order to minimise moral hazard and ensure fiscal sustainability – in other words, the features of an economic and political union required to make mutualisation of debt rational for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close with a word on Greece. The Commission’s message to the Greek people is this: we want Greece to remain part of the European family and of the euro. After living beyond its means for too long, the journey Greece is now undertaking is difficult and demanding, but it is a journey we are taking together in a pact of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro area has stood by Greece in all of its difficulties and we will continue to do so, not only through the unprecedented levels of financial assistance contained in the two packages and the debt write-down – that together are equal to EUR 33 600 per Greek citizen – but also through the many assistance and support programmes, the effective implementation of which depends on the determination of the Greek leaders and people. I am talking here about programmes to get the Structural Funds working on the ground where they are needed: loans for small and medium-sized enterprises, support for young people without jobs, and technical assistance to reform tax systems to make them efficient and fair, and to eliminate red tape for businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We are ready to stand by Greece on its journey of reform. We want to stand by Greece. Having said that, Greece must remain determined to reform. We are convinced that there is no easier way. We are convinced that the alternative would be far worse. So let me take this opportunity to call on all responsible forces in Greece to use these few precious weeks to get the facts across, so that the Greek people can make a fully informed and responsible choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude. There is no silver bullet for economic growth. If there were, it would have been fired already. The build-up of debts, deficits and imbalances in our economies did not happen overnight. It happened over many years, and the rebalancing we are now going through will not be concluded overnight either. That is why it is so important to stay the course on sustainable and sound public finances. At the same time, the Commission strongly supports the renewed drive for growth that is now sweeping across Europe. We are confident that there is now the political will and determination to move forward, starting with many of the proposals for sustainable growth that the Commission has already put on the table. Now is the moment to go further with our actions for growth and to get them working at the service of Europe’s citizens. We count on you here in this House to help make it happen. There is no reason to wait. Indeed, there is no time to lose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corien Wortmann-Kool, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in many Member States, all the stops are being pulled out in order to get our economy back on its feet and to get the budget under control. I have respect for countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy for the efforts they are putting in, but also for a country in a completely different part of Europe, namely Poland, our beacon of growth in eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are making progress, but the situation remains very fragile, and the engine of growth is faltering. We therefore have to go all out to safeguard our social market economy. We have to do our utmost to tackle unemployment and, above all, unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment, as well as to ensure a strong small and medium-sized business sector as an important jobs creator for our economy. That need is urgent, and we need to be creative in searching to find the solution, not least in order to safeguard a future for our social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our group advocates economic growth built on strong foundations. We advocate sustainable economic growth rather than economic growth built on quicksand. Simply focusing on spending more money and increasing our debts is not the path we advocate, as that would mean passing on our debts to the next generation. Growth is not a magic spell that enables us to avoid painful and sometimes unpopular measures.</p>
<p class="contents">No, if we really do tackle the problems now, we can provide a sense of perspective and regain people’s confidence. That is our goal. Our group stands for tangible solutions, and these involve implementing reforms in order to return government finances to good health and reforms in order to return the foundations of our economy to good health.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear from the report published by the OECD today that priority efforts are required in this regard. These reforms will cause some pain, but in the long run, they will bring in money instead of costing it. The first, most important priority in this is competitiveness. If we re-establish that, then we can once again occupy a sturdy position in export markets, provide jobs for our people and ensure economic growth. In particular – as I said already – the big issue has to be youth unemployment. We have to provide an opportunity for our young people again, and to do so we also need to establish binding targets in the Member States. Easy access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises is thus an important priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we need to go further with reforms. We need to continue the efforts based on the ‘six-pack’, the Stability and Growth Pact and macro-economic surveillance, and the Commission has, for the first time, an important role to play here in evaluating the plans of the Member States. I call on the Commission to be ambitious. Highlight good examples, but also let us see where there are deficiencies and greater efforts are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second focal area for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is our internal market. Mr President, we may have heard the new French President, Monsieur Hollande, talking about growth, but we have not heard him talk about tangible reforms that he will introduce in France in order to return the French economy to good health. We have also heard nothing from President Hollande about how he intends to promote the internal market. It alone can already deliver 2% economic growth <span class="italic">per annum</span>, and we have more work to do in that regard, in the interests of Europe’s 500 million consumers. There is a great deal of potential that remains unexploited.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, Commissioner, that you referred to the European patent, as that is something that we really should be sorting out quickly at this point. There should also be harmonised rules on data protection and legislation for professional qualifications. In addition, we know that, in many areas, European legislation is in place, but that there is a failure in implementation. This also applies to infringement procedures, which are too slow and too toothless.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we also need to be much more active in terms of reporting in connection with the European Semester; producing reports, naming and shaming, and making it clear where things need to be better, including in that area. Linked to the internal market, red tape is also important and needs to be tackled. An extra 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority for our group is increasing investments that actually contribute to growth. Sooner rather than later, we need to tackle research and innovation, investment in infrastructure, utilising unspent European funds and the role of the European Investment Bank, including in relation to project bonds. I hope that we can now get going on all of this really quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to wish you a great deal of wisdom, including tomorrow and in the run-up to the European Council. We are on your side in order to also realise these priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, with your permission, I would like to add briefly to the statement that you made yesterday about Italy. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my solidarity and sympathy with the Italian people, who have been so hard hit by two serious events: the brutal attack at the Morvillo-Falcone school in Brindisi, where the young Melissa Bassi lost her life, and the powerful earthquake which hit Emilia-Romagna, an area I have often visited and whose strength and tenacity I am familiar with.</p>
<p class="contents">The victims and their families must know that we are with them, that the whole of Europe supports them and that together we will overcome this. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> What does this have to do with the situation in Europe? I believe that it has a great deal to do with it, because the sense of unity and solidarity which has been shown within Italy itself and which we are showing towards Italy is something that I would like to see in the context of the major disaster that has occurred in Europe in the area of unemployment. I am of the opinion that we must do everything possible to ensure that this informal summit and later the formal summit have the courage to tackle the serious problem of unemployment, because we are in a position to prevent it from increasing and to take active measures to combat it, which is perhaps not as easy in the case of an earthquake. However, unemployment is not an act of God. It is a man-made problem and we can stop it from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the starting point must be to encourage investment. We have reached an historic low point with regard to both public and private investment and it is no coincidence that our unemployment rates are so high, given that our investment levels are so low.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of whether we extend the deadlines for achieving budget stability, but without putting it at risk, or whether we go back to Mario Monti’s golden rule, which I believe would be very helpful and which states that certain investments, especially in Europe 2020 projects, must be removed from the deficits, we must make investment possible, so that we can return to growth. Of course, we need the funding to do this and it could come from the financial transaction tax that we will debate and decide on tomorrow or from the fight against tax evasion, as Mr Rehn has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we need project loans on a suitable scale. We must provide the European Investment Bank with more funding. Of course, we also need to make better use of the Structural Funds. Finally, we also need something like eurobonds, because we must also reduce the cost of borrowing. This is a long-term project, but it is important for us to tackle the problems now.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this does not put budget discipline at risk. On the contrary, it even gives us the option of achieving budget discipline earlier, if can put in place these measures to stimulate growth. When people ask what is happening with budget discipline in general, I can only say that we have the ‘six-pack’. In committee, the decision was made to introduce the ‘two-pack’. If the committee members held back in this area, this was because we wanted to add something specifically with regard to the subject of growth. In essence, we want to see growth and investment. I hope that we can reach an appropriate solution together here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say a few words on the subject of Greece. It is true that this is a difficult situation and we must be aware of all the democratic decisions being made in Greece. However, it is important for the Greeks to realise that they must decide for themselves whether they want to stay in or leave the euro area, but that this will, of course, have consequences for Europe. It is clear that reforms are needed in Greece and perhaps to an even greater extent than before. When there is a government in office which is prepared to implement these reforms, then we can talk about the necessary relief measures, in particular, with regard to social issues. We have been saying for a long time, including in this House, that not everything that the troika has proposed is socially just and acceptable. However, first there must be a government in place which commits to the reform programme in Greece and which is prepared to make tough sacrifices. Then it will be possible to negotiate with the government in order to introduce the relief measures which will ultimately result in Greece being able to balance its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It has repeatedly been said that the entire growth problem could lead to higher inflation and that is a social problem. What could be more unsocial than our current levels of unemployment? Our group believes that the most unsocial thing of all is unemployment and we must combat it by means of growth and investment.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span>– Mr President, the summit tomorrow is the 18th special summit which has been organised since the start of the crisis in December 2009 – the 18th, and every time those organising these summits say ‘Yes, this is a final summit, it is an important summit, it is a summit where we shall tackle the real origins of this crisis’.</p>
<p class="contents">Only two months ago, you remember Mr President, in this room, there were a number of EU leaders who said that the crisis was behind us – that it was over – and they were wrong. They were dramatically wrong because this euro crisis started with Greece, a country that has an economy representing only 2% of European GDP, but today we are facing another crisis with Spain, which is the fourth economy of the eurozone, and with Italy, the third economy of the eurozone. Together they add up to something as big as the German economy, and these two economies, these two countries, are paying interest rates of more than 6% and we have spreads today of more than 500 basic points. That is today!</p>
<p class="contents">So let us be clear: not only is this crisis not over, but it is not about Greece. It is not a crisis about Portugal; it is not a crisis about Ireland; it is not about Italy or about Spain. It is, in my opinion, not even an economic crisis or, indeed, a financial crisis. It is simply a political crisis that we face today in Europe, because our leaders today are unable to take the right decision at the right time. They are unable to create what we need, which is an economic and fiscal union alongside the monetary union, and the fact that the current situation is so dramatic is their responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">They have, in fact, transformed what was a small financial crisis in December 2009, involving just 2% of European GDP, into a crisis of unforeseen magnitude today. That is the main topic for a NATO summit. The euro crisis is a NATO summit topic today, and the other leaders of the world are pointing the finger at Europe. Why? Because three things are necessary but our leaders are not capable of deciding on them. First of all, we need a real economic and fiscal union. Secondly, we need to mutualise the debt with a redemption fund as quickly as possible if we want interest rates to go down for countries like Spain and Italy. Thirdly, we need a growth pact to relaunch the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">My plea today is not to the Council or to the Member States, whose interests the Council chiefly defends. My plea is to the Commission: it has the right of initiative. The ball is in the court of the Commission. Mr Obama is waiting for it; we are waiting for it; even Mr Cameron is waiting for it. What are you waiting for? That is my question today.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is double. Firstly, I ask that the Commission should put on the Council table a proposal for a redemption fund because that will have a positive effect on the markets, and it will be impossible for even Ms Merkel to deny it or refuse it. Secondly, I am asking for a growth package to be put on the table. We know the various elements of that: increase the capital of the European Investment Bank; use the unspent money of the European funds; and launch project bonds – and that brings me to my final point.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be blunt: they told us that tomorrow they would announce project bonds as one of the instruments for economic growth – a proposal worth EUR 230 million. That is the proposal which is on the table today. But we need billions, Commissioner, not millions, and we need not a temporary solution, as they are discussing, but a permanent solution for growth in Europe. So my plea to the Commission is this: use the right of initiative that only you have, and put on the table tomorrow a real proposal for project bonds, a real proposal for a redemption fund and a real proposal for a real growth package for Europe.</p>

I hope that a different approach will be taken tomorrow at the informal summit from that in the initial speeches which I heard here.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the desperate situation in Greece, which is a disaster in both political and economic terms, is primarily the result of a combination of two major problems. The first is a comprehensive failure of the state in Greece that has been tolerated for a long time and the second is an austerity programme imposed by the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which we have said right from the beginning was not feasible. The combination of these two problems, against the background of a very deep financial and economic crisis, not only in Europe but throughout the world, has resulted in the downward spiral which Greece now finds itself in.</p>
<p class="contents">We are expecting you, Mr Rehn, and the representative of the Council Presidency to talk about this at the summit because we know that this downward spiral not only involves the Greeks, but could also pull in the citizens of other crisis countries or even the entire European Union, if the European Council does not finally get around to discussing the failings and weaknesses of the current crisis policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent days, we have read that there is a slow motion run on the banks under way in Greece. We know that if this goes on, Spain and Italy will also be affected. I would like to know why many Heads of State or Government are saying no longer only off the record, but also almost openly: ‘If the Greeks do not want to stay, then they should go’. I think this is a ridiculously irresponsible attitude. I believe that tomorrow, a decision must be made to allow the Greeks more time to stabilise their budget and their state.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rehn, I also think the Commission must by now have reached the point that it can say tomorrow how the hundreds of millions of euro in Brussels which currently cannot be accessed by Greece can be used immediately to create jobs for young people in Greece and, for example, to fund the changeover to sustainable energy. It would be a clear demonstration of the EU’s shortcomings if tomorrow, everyone were to continue behaving as if they were helpless.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that Greece must stay in the euro area and not only because we know that this is better for Greece, but also because we are convinced that it is better for the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are discussions about growth tomorrow, we hope that they will not once again concern, for example, the bubble which was almost directly responsible for leading Spain into its current crisis. If we talk about growth, then we must discuss sustainability, which can be achieved by means of consistent climate protection measures and energy and resource efficiency. We have spoken on numerous occasions about the fact that resource saving production processes and products are a guarantee for jobs not only today, but also in the future. The Commission is working on the assumption that between six and 10 million new jobs can be created in these fields by 2020. Where are the initiatives in these areas?</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of financing, I believe that we can achieve something with different areas of European funding, including the funds that we must now make consistent use of on the basis of policy requirements, and with the options available from the European Investment Bank (EIB). However, without similar investments on a national level and without promoting private investments on a large scale, we will not be able to achieve our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that you can discuss growth tomorrow, but unless you talk seriously about how you plan to tackle the refinancing problem in Spain and in Greece and about the debt redemption fund and the prospects for eurobonds, then the growth pact that has been presented today will simply go up in smoke. We need a genuine fiscal union, a subject which has often been discussed in this House. As the chair of a group, I am slowly getting sick and tired of the feeling that speaking to the Council and the Commission is like talking to a brick wall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Callanan, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ECR Group. </span>– Mr President, we are having yet another European summit. I make it the 22nd that we have had in the last two and a half years. Mr Verhofstadt said it was the 18th but it would not be the first time that he has got his numbers wrong!</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know what else Mr Van Rompuy has done, but he has certainly been very good at calling summits. None of the others have made any material difference so why, we ask ourselves, should this one? The reason that they have all so far failed is that none of them has addressed the real problem which, of course, is the collapse of European competitiveness. I think all of us in this House have a common objective. We all, of course, want the old mantra of growth and jobs, yet we have very different views on how that should be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">For the socialists, across several groups in this House, only more government spending can create growth. I fundamentally disagree. The socialist vision of growth is an illusion created at the expense of borrowing and tax rises, and it is totally irresponsible in the current climate. As my favourite politician, Margaret Thatcher, once said, the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of everybody else’s money. We cannot afford a return to the discredited socialist growth agenda of Keynesianism dressed up as more investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth does not need state intervention. In fact, very often state intervention actually restricts growth. Take, for example, the Agency Workers Directive. This well-meaning piece of legislation, introduced through this House, has resulted in a fall in the number of temporary workers being employed in France. The Working Time Directive actually stops people from working. In a crisis, it is utterly immoral. So-called social protection legislation in the EU is failing to protect us from the worst social injustice of all, which is unemployment. We risk having the best protected workforce in the world, but no workers.</p>
<p class="contents">More flexible labour markets are the way forward. EU leaders should ask which employment directive they can repeal immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need, as others have said, a bonfire of red tape. Each piece of additional legislation acts like a pin in the body of our economy. It can survive a few, but eventually it will be killed by a thousand pinpricks. The Commission’s inertia-driven ‘better regulation’ agenda should be replaced by a politically driven deregulation agenda, and this Parliament can play a role here by spending more of our time considering how to repeal, refine and reform existing measures. The EU needs to do less and it needs to do it better.</p>
<p class="contents">I have talked about what we can do less of. What can we do better? Commissioners, the answer lies in the letter signed by 12 Heads of Government. They sent you a clear set of ideas for extending the single market, for pursing free-trade agreements, for a European research area, and no end of good proposals. Sadly, the reaction from Presidents Barroso and Van Rompuy was disappointing. They continue to fall back on the Europe 2020 agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">That agenda is lacking because it tries to be all things to all men. It contains some things to appeal to a liberal conservative like me, it has parts to appeal to socialists like Mr Swoboda, and even parts to appeal to a social democrat like Mr Verhofstadt. There are probably no parts that appeal to Nigel Farage, but then again the Commissioners are not miracle workers. Europe 2020 will not work unless it learns the lessons of the failed Lisbon strategy, which did not achieve its primary goal.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to the Commission is this: we need a strong, free-trade, pro-competition agenda from you. At the moment, the Commission is effectively rudderless. The letter showed you the way forward and yet you disregarded it. The reform that the EU needs will not come about from one additional dinner, but tomorrow’s meeting can make an important start. It should give the Commission a clear message that it wants to see a free-trade, deregulatory and pro-market agenda. It should tell the Commission to go away and rethink the next seven-year budget so that every euro focuses on added-value outputs, rather than simply increasing national contribution inputs. Most importantly, it should place the single market at the heart of our economic recovery. Unless we resolve our competitiveness crisis, we will never resolve the many other crises facing the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">How many more dinners and summits will it take before we actually get some action that will make a difference?</p>

Indeed, Herman Van Rompuy is not here either, not that it really matters because they are not prepared to listen to any debate or any argument. They are intent on pursuing their political dream of a United States of Europe and are prepared to commit economic suicide for an entire continent.</p>
<p class="contents">And tomorrow night Mr Van Rompuy has called yet another summit at which he is going to present a strategy for growth and jobs. Elected MEPs, representatives of the people of Europe, from left and right, we have heard it all before. Remember the euro itself was supposed to create growth and jobs and yet it is actively destroying both of those things. The remedy we are being offered is more of the same. I would suggest that the medicine is killing the patient and to increase the dosage is madness.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not listen to those who will tell you that the only alternative is for Greece to stay in the euro. Everyone is pushing this. David Cameron and all the other leaders are saying that we must keep Greece in the euro; if she leaves, the sky will fall in. It will not. There will be a few difficult weeks and then things will settle down. There will be a boom in tourism. Investment will start to come back into Greece. Innovation will start to come back into Greece as people start making products to beat expensive imports. Indeed, Greece outside the eurozone may well prove to be an inspiration for Spain, for Portugal and for many other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to recognise that a terrible mistake has been made. We must resolve to put it right. We have got to give people hope because out there now is absolute despair. We all remember Dimitris Christoulas, the 77-year-old former pharmacist who shot himself dead outside the Greek Parliament, but he is just one of a growing humanitarian disaster. There have been huge increases in suicides in Italy and in Greece, particularly by people running small businesses who cannot see a way out of the problem. Children are being left in increasing numbers outside the doors of churches because their parents cannot afford to feed them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our leaders are too callous to listen and care. You can do something about this. You can rise up and say – and I know from my conversations with you that many of you agree with me – that I am right. We have got to break up the euro. We have got to restore democracy. We have got to restore human dignity. We must ignore Messrs Barroso and Van Rompuy. They have been proved to be wrong. We must provide people with hope.</p>

On the one hand, we are being reminded, and rightly so, about the difficult social situation of the people who are suffering from the effects of austerity policies and, on the other hand, solutions are being proposed which will once again have an impact on the poorest of the poor. The only thing I can say in response is that the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the democratic majorities in the European Union should be protecting us from solutions of this kind, which are simply inhumane.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to look at the fact that measures have been imposed on the Greek Government for months which have led to greater poverty for its citizens. This is true and this is exactly what must be changed. The Greek economy is about to collapse even further under the weight of the austerity measures. In addition, the economies of Spain, Italy and other EU Member States are expected to shrink, despite stringent austerity programmes. Now the drastic cuts in public spending are to be accompanied by measures to stimulate growth. You yourself have also explained this on behalf of the Presidency. This involves promoting policies for growth and global competitiveness in conditions which include high levels of sovereign debt and ongoing crises. That is precisely the poisoned chalice which is being handed to these countries. It will not help to bring about a recovery or to put an end to the causes of the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not what is needed to bring about genuine sustainable and inclusive growth and to eliminate economic, fiscal and financial inequalities. The top priority for all investments must be to combat poverty and the destruction of the environment. Resource saving investments and a fundamental reorganisation of energy, industrial and agricultural policy and of the transport system are required, In other respects, I do not see any basic differences between this and the political platform of Syriza, which has been subject to such heavy criticism here in recent days and weeks and which has been described as if it were an extremist party. The question we need to answer is: what form should new negotiations take? We also need to ask ourselves whether all the accusations being made against Greece about the debts that it has run up are justified. Should we not carry out an audit or an evaluation of the debts and are new negotiations not urgently needed in this context?</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise the situation, when we talk about growth, the Council should decide tomorrow whether it wants to use Ms Merkel’s growth model or to follow the course promised by Mr Hollande, for example, during the French election campaign. That is something quite different, with a focus on quality and not just on quantity. It is about really helping people and ensuring that economic growth benefits public interests. The economy is designed to serve people and not just to be an end in itself. Economic growth can only be discussed against this background. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an elephant in the room, but if we all act as if there were not, maybe it will go away, or at least we will believe that it has gone.

<p class="contents">In recent weeks, we have heard another couple of odd pronouncements, for instance, from a European Commissioner who called a Greek exit from the euro area, and I quote, ‘the end of civilisation in that country’, no more and no less. It is precisely that kind of self-blinding that makes it impossible to achieve real solutions. Those solutions are not to be found in a blind leap to policies such as direct European taxation, community eurobonds or a European ‘redemption fund’, which would lay yet more taxes at the door of the net payers, and would only encourage irresponsible behaviour on the part of some net recipient countries. The result of this would be that the economic problems would only get worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fairytale number 1: austerity policies are cold and heartless and push people into social exclusion. That is not true. Austerity policies involve creating opportunities, so that future generations have the chance to do the jobs that they need to do. While the policy in some areas is sustainable, what has repeatedly been said here about financial policy is not sustainable at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairytale number 2: eurobonds are the solution to all our problems. In fact, eurobonds are a sweet-tasting poison. They provide those people with money under favourable terms who can no longer obtain it elsewhere under favourable terms, so that they can run up even more debts. This is why we must categorically reject eurobonds.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairytale number 3: all our problems will be solved by a debt redemption fund. Just to make it clear what we are talking about, a debt redemption fund means that the Member States generate surpluses <span class="italic">per se</span>, so that they can make use of the fund. During the repayment period, they cannot accumulate any new debts, otherwise the whole system will cease to function.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look more closely at the truth and the reality before we start calling for model solutions. For this reason, the only possibility for offering people lasting future prospects and for defending the European social model on an ongoing basis in competition with other economic areas is to increase our competitiveness. We will not do this by relying more heavily on the state. Instead, we need to give companies the opportunity to invest money, for example, by selling building plots where people know that what they build on the plot will belong to them, as an illustration of the problem in Greece, and where they know that the state will not constantly be intervening with non-tariff trade barriers to limit their growth, as an illustration of the problem in France.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only increase our competitiveness by overcoming the challenges on global markets and Germany is a good example of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It included projects on clean energy, transport, new technologies and innovation, and the role of the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds was already being weighed up then.</p>
<p class="contents">Over three years later, we have been able to produce the ‘six-pack’, the Euro Plus Pact, the fiscal compact and the ‘two-pack’, all of which are full of increased discipline and penalties. Meanwhile, however, unemployment – particularly youth unemployment – is reaching alarming levels, the European economy is going into recession and more than seven of the Member States are suffering negative growth. At the same time, while Greece is no more than a first tremor threatening to bring down the whole edifice, the relaunch agenda seems to have been forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda is clear at the moment. Already, what is important at this point is not to make it a matter of urgency, but rather a matter of emergency, in a situation threatening to explode. There is an urgent need for intervention founded on a number of areas. First, a sort of European Marshall Plan needs to be established, with investment promoting growth, employment and convergence. Project bonds are one of the possible sources. Second, the interest rates at which countries are financed need to be stabilised. Let us prepare, at least, to coordinate the issue of sovereign debt and to manage jointly the debt accumulated. Third, the European Stability Mechanism and the European Central Bank (ECB) must be readied to act as proper firewalls for defending European sovereign debt. Fourth, the credit that the ECB transferred <span class="italic">en masse</span> to commercial banks must find its way to companies. There is EUR 1 trillion being held back in the banking system, while thousands of viable European companies go out of business every day because they lack finance. Fifth, investment makes no sense without demand. The weaker economies are being crushed under the weight of austerity packages. It is the stronger economies that need to free up domestic demand. Around 80% of trade now takes place within Europe, and it falls to the Commission, specifically Mr Rehn, to make recommendations directed not just at the weaker economies, but also at the more dynamic ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concluding now, Mr President. Finally, there must be a limit to the measures imposed by the troika. We have gone far enough with the punitive style, without dialogue and without accountability, whereby high officials determine the fate of millions of Europeans and of Member States’ democratic institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, some talk of financial stability and fiscal consolidation, while others talk of growth, pitting one against the other. In truth, we obviously need both. We need fiscal stability, we need to be back balancing the budgets and we need to support growth. It seems to me that this is a matter of common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">To sustain growth, here, too, we firstly need structural reforms, to regain competitiveness and, at the same time, invest in our future and give our children opportunities for the future. The fact is, Member States are unfortunately massively in debt and it is therefore up to the European Union to invest in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I say yes to a massive increase, if possible, in European Investment Bank (EIB) capital, yes to eurobonds, but a substantial amount unlike the amount announced by the Commission. And why not yes to the mobilisation of European savings for future projects? I think this is an option that should really be opened up. Yes to a tax on financial transactions so that the EU finally has its own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as Guy Verhofstadt said, to provide opportunities for the future, we also need to think about how we can basically lower interest rates. Why not a new role for the European Central Bank (ECB) or pooling part of our debt? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet when it is a colleague of Mr Rehn, namely Karel De Gucht, the European Commissioner, or a Governor of the European Central Bank, like Mr Coene, the President of the National Bank of Belgium, who starts rambling on in public, all innocent, saying no problem, Greece could leave the euro, I think this is more serious because these people are hugely responsible for what happened last week in Greece, when we saw the early signs of a bank run.</p>
<p class="contents">When you are a European policy maker, I do not think you should be behaving any old how with bar-room politics.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What concerns me then, as it does many of you here, is Spain. Let us be clear. Of course, this summit meeting in Brussels tomorrow may be of use, but unless it comes up with a credible answer to what we should do to avoid financial collapse in Spain or Italy, we are failing to address the urgency of the situation. We do not have many options: either we ask the European Central Bank (ECB) to buy the debt – yet, it cannot do this because of European treaties – or we go back to the solution proposed at the time by none other than Mr Sarkozy, which would be for the European Stability Mechanism to become a bank which can lend to Member States or recapitalise the banking sector. I think this is a common sense solution, and it is time we looked at this again.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of growth, I would prefer to talk about investment. If we are to go about this, as mentioned in Spain yesterday, by building 40 airports, or today in Greece, by laying the foundations for new motorways, I think we are missing the point. Unless we introduce a programme of investment that makes Europe a world leader in energy and resource efficiency, we are wasting the one real opportunity for Europe to become a twenty-first century economic leader.</p>
<p class="contents">This should be our one and only driving force. It is not just about investing in bricks and mortar. It is about investing in education and research, investing in health care, all of which are factors of competitiveness, to coin one of your phrases. I think that is how we should go about it.</p>

Now it is growth of course, but unfortunately, we will achieve neither fiscal discipline nor growth in the atmosphere of uncertainty and unpredictability that we now have. Certainty and predictability: this is what we need most at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this unpredictability and uncertainty is mostly caused by the wrong perception of the situation by the EU institutions, by the Commission and by Parliament, by us. Six months ago, Mr Barroso told me in this House that Greece would never leave the eurozone. Now even some Commissioners admit that this might happen and that Plan B is necessary for Greece. So what kind of assessment of the situation is that? It is just from one side to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that our institutions, unfortunately, have lost the ability to reflect public mood in the European Union because in hard times, as we have seen in France and in Greece repeatedly, people are looking at voting for strong national leaders to give responses to their problems. They do not care about us, they do not care about the Commission, they do not care about Parliament, and because of what? Because people are fed up with all that never-ending lunatic ideology of fiscal and political union that people like Mr Verhofstadt are still trying to sell, but no one is buying. People do not buy it any more so please let us stop talking about this nonsense. Let us be real. Let us deliver something real to the people, something we can do. Let us do our job. Let us, for instance, complete the single market and let us admit that fiscal discipline growth is mostly in the hands of Member States.

Youth unemployment is a scourge that will affect Europeans for generations. People who suffer unemployment in their early years subsequently tend to earn much less. They suffer deterioration of skills and future job instability. In Spain, a staggering 46.4% of young people are out of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it any coincidence that the states with the worst problems are members of the eurozone? The OECD has stated that the eurozone crisis is the biggest single threat to global recovery. The eurozone 17 will see their economy shrink by 1.9% this year. In contrast, both the UK and the US economies will grow. More than one in five young people across the European Union as a whole are unemployed and figures released yesterday by the UN suggest that this is set to get worse. UK businesses, both small and large, are crying out for less bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, EU leaders will meet in Brussels to discuss jobs and growth. We can expect a self-congratulatory press release and a nice photograph, but we know by now what will happen. Good money will be thrown after bad. Nothing will change and, instead of stemming the red tape that kills jobs, the strangulation will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear to all of us that the debate conducted by Parliament in recent months on the intergovernmental agreement known as the fiscal compact has vindicated all political groups: I believe that the concerns we expressed have all come true. I am also sorry that the minister denies that there is a gap between austerity and development because I think that this dichotomy has hitherto paralysed our debate, as well as Europe’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">The one-way monetary policy is not a development policy, just as a balanced budget is a bureaucratic, systematic element, but not forward-looking. The clash between austerity and development is not suited to the complexity and the needs of Europe – something we are all becoming aware of – because we are finding it difficult to move forward, which is perhaps the result of this deficiency and cultural poverty which always leads to an economic freeze.</p>
<p class="contents">At the forthcoming summit, we must therefore develop a different policy, creating a political Europe as well as a fiscal Europe. While the Commissioner has stated he is ready for action, Parliament can only take him at his word. This is an important statement because to date, we have had to create the conditions, at least I interpret it that way, positively, even though others have taken different positions. However, we need finally to agree on a plan, a strategy able to create a political Europe, which is vital for a Europe of development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the short term, for Greece, we should realise that all those who thought that Greece could have a smooth exit from the euro area are being totally unrealistic; we have no Great Wall of China to protect us should Greece leave the euro area. Although we should also recognise that, in the Greek situation, nothing will be resolved if we continue to implement the troika’s mandate, which the Greeks rejected today. If we do not think things through, then nothing will be possible; there will be no general framework for an economic recovery, no hope restored, no dialogue and no solidarity at European level, be it in Greece or at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as you know, Mr Hollande’s election offers a rare window of opportunity to raise these issues again under new conditions. I do not agree with Mr Ferber when he said that there is only one model in Europe, the German model. We are a union built on diversity. Therefore, grab this window of opportunity that you have been given to finally provide Europe with all the answers it needs. These answers include a growth strategy, but not just any growth strategy. It should look beyond the internal market to avoid the traps of negative integration. These solutions should also include a genuine industrial policy, enabling us to make the investments we need to make our Europe a sustainable Europe, where jobs are created, where the main waste is not this generation currently being squeezed out of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">You must admit then, Commissioner, that the way in which pressure is currently being put on Greece to reorganise its administration, while nothing is being done to help it with its negotiations with Switzerland, to put an end to the tax evasion performed by the privileged few in this country, is a source of injustice that neither the Greeks nor the Europeans, nor the French, nor the British nor the Germans should accept.</p>

The question which both Ms Harms and Mr Verhofstadt have raised is: does Europe and does the EU have the steely political will in this situation to continue its strategy of working together to overcome major problems? I must say that, even if I ignore the anti-Europeans in this House, many of the remarks which I have heard here lead me to doubt that this is the case. For example, why does the representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) give a long list of the countries she respects, simply so that everyone understands that Greece is not one of those countries? Why does Mr Ferber repeat his absurdly exaggerated call for budgetary discipline? We need budgetary discipline, but his own government is not doing at home what it is telling the rest of Europe to do.</p>
<p class="contents">It depends on Parliament and on the Commission whether there is enough community initiative to come to grips with this crisis. It is not sufficient, Mr Rehn, to emphasise the less controversial issues and to highlight once again the commitment to growth and jobs which everyone shares.</p>

The threat stems from the instability and uncertainty of the financial system, and it only needs one country to become unstable for all of us to be exposed to the real danger of economic chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">However, before we make a scapegoat out of Greece, we should recall that it was not just Greek officials who helped in the falsification of data on its deficit, but also the banks that operate there, as well as the European officials whose duty it was to monitor and supervise the processes involved. Besides, Greece’s debt is chiefly the effect of the instability written into the structure of the single market and the euro area, the problem of the deindustrialisation of Greece from the moment it joined the Union and the problem of cheap credit. The continuing imbalance in the balance of payments in favour of Europe’s major economies could not have produced any other result.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time for change and to correct flawed policy. It is high time for a policy of growth. In this situation, it is important that we remember – and I quote here the words of the Polish economist Ladislau Dowbor – that to warrant workers better wages and rights is not demagogy; it is a more simple and straightforward way of generating demand and stimulating the economy. Investing in people is what enhances economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it being held in order to diffuse the serious opposition to the extreme neoliberal policies being applied in the European Union? Is it being held in order to give false hopes and stop the spread of criticism and questions expressed by the results in Greece, France and, most probably, Ireland or is there an honest intention, which I cannot see, to bring about a sea change and hence a change of policy?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the leaders of the majority of countries are following policies of fiscal austerity and strict discipline which circumvent every democratic right and labour right. They are fanatically dedicated to that policy and that is the policy they will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we cannot expect a different policy from those leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rehn, will we have to listen to yet more of the same about responsible and irresponsible political forces in Greece? Yet more of the same about uninformed Greek citizens? Let me assure you that Greek citizens, like European citizens, are informed and responsible. Neither your interventions nor the summits apparently called to discuss the question of growth will be able to divert them from the radical changes they want in order to create a Europe of cohesion, democracy and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Actually, Minister, the problem at hand does not come under the authority of the rotating Presidency. Since there has been a permanent Presidency, we at the European Parliament no longer have any contact with Heads of State or Government. We are facing a problem which falls to the European Council and Heads of State or Government. I regret that we have no dealings with Mr Van Rompuy because the truth is that the Council convened tomorrow and one at the end of June is intended to close the European Semester. This is not exactly the European Council on growth that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) asked for as far back as early December last year.</p>
<p class="contents">A few thoughts on the matter: firstly, we are no longer listening to advocates of zero growth. This is good news. Next, I reiterate the idea that we should examine the effectiveness of public spending. I propose an independent audit, conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors, to find out where we could make savings: 27 armies, yet no enemies, research programmes that have been funded 15 times without any coordination, hundreds of diplomatic buildings where the costs are not even shared.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of thought is competitiveness. A word that is not used enough. Firstly, the competitiveness of our companies (flexicurity, labour costs) – and this does not mean public spending and higher levies as proposed by Mr Hollande to resolve the problems of competitiveness that we face in Europe and France. Next, the competitiveness of the continent. Yes, we need a major infrastructure plan for roads, digital technology, space and universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for struggling States, I suggest, in line with Jean-Paul Gauzès’ proposals, that we consider establishing hive-off vehicles, beyond ratios, with a banking licence, in other words, access to the European Central Banks (ECB)’s cash to help States recover. However, each State needs to pay off its debts. We are never going to get a political majority whereby the people of one State pay off another State’s debts. Each State needs to pay off its own debts.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, the speech on the State of the Union is woefully inadequate. I propose organising a Congress of the Union in the autumn, which would bring together Heads of State or Government, the European Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure that the direction of the continent is in the interests of the European people.</p>

I would like to say to the representatives of the Council Presidency: you know very well that the level of public investment in countries like Germany is currently zero. The situation is not much better elsewhere. This means that public property in Europe is falling into disrepair. Wherever the troika is not forcing states to sell this property below its real value, it is becoming dilapidated. What is your response to this? I have not heard you say anything.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, Mr Monti’s name was on everyone’s lips and he was frequently quoted when he talked about the internal market. Today, Mr Monti is saying how important it is for us to invest in our national economies and none of you have mentioned his name. Neither the Council nor the Commission have made any comment on his proposals. I would very much like to know why.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is a reason why we are not making progress. Your explanations that, on the one hand, we need to save and, on the other, that we must stimulate growth are all correct. Unfortunately, however, they do not explain why something is happening. Instead, they explain why nothing is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a reason why this is the case, which is that the people who have the upper hand in the Commission and in the Council believe that the best way of climbing a mountain is to put on the brakes on the way up. This runs counter to the laws of physics, just as your economic proposals run counter to the laws of mathematics. I expect you to make changes, because if you do not take up a clear position, you will not help Europe to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to continue consolidating the national budgets. That is not an end in itself, Mr Bullmann. If investment levels are currently low or even at zero, as you say, then there is a reason for this. We are paying interest on the debts that we have accumulated in the past instead of building schools. We are paying interest instead of building roads. We are paying interest instead of investing in innovation and research. We need to continue consolidating the national budgets so that we can begin investing in these areas again.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important topic is structural reforms. Productivity, efficiency, competitiveness, entrepreneurship and an appropriate level of taxation for businesses will all help to ensure that the Member States and their markets are competitive. It concerns me that the labour market reforms in Italy have come to a stop. We need to abolish Article 18. I do not understand how anyone can be opposed to that.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is growth. How do we intend to finance it? The UK is not prepared to go along with the financial transaction tax. This amounts to false accounting. The European Investment Bank is a much better solution. In addition, the Commission must finally submit proposals as to how we can mobilise the available money in the Structural Funds for use in Greece and the other countries, because we have already been talking about this for two years. We gradually need to introduce some concrete measures. We have been talking about this for two years without anything being done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore need a change, and although the actions on which a consensus seems to be emerging are certainly positive, they are still insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The project bonds pilot project is an important precedent, but its macro-economic impact is just a drop in the ocean. Even strengthening the European Investment Bank, which has greater potential, is not decisive, whilst better spending of Structural Funds is unlikely to have much of an effect since we currently lack even the resources to pay for projects already begun.</p>
<p class="contents">Two essential elements for emerging from the crisis are missing. The first is a reformulation of the Stability Pact, which would also affect the fiscal compact without it needing to be amended, to separate a portion of investments from calculation of the structural deficit, giving the Commission a specific role in establishing them and activating this separation in recessive phases of the cycle. The second is joint management of a portion of the public debt based on the model of the proposed debt redemption fund.</p>
<p class="contents">These two elements must go hand in hand and form a ‘growth and stability pack’ which must be EU-wide in order to be effective: so a ‘pack’ and not a ‘compact’. For this we need to make the most of the ‘two-pack’ discussion in order to act quickly and effectively on EU legislation. I believe that the Commission should play a clearly defined role in this process and stop defending an austerity policy now acknowledged by everyone as disastrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no chance of emerging from this crisis without promoting growth, especially in those countries hit hardest by the financial crisis. However, when I hear some fellow Members here, I sometimes get the impression that they think growth can continue with excessive deficits and bad public accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">We must press ahead with the spending cuts and structural reforms. We can do everything possible on the growth side, but we cannot abandon the path of containing and reducing public spending and of structural reforms. More growth cannot mean being less careful and easing up: more growth and more growth policies must go hand in hand with greater rigour in relation to the public accounts and to structural reforms. If we just start talking about growth and thinking there are magic solutions to growth, we will end up back with unsustainable public debt and will carry on without the structural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I should like to draw attention to the fact that tomorrow’s summit will not just debate the issue of long- or medium-term growth: the urgent issue of Greece will also be on the table and I consider it crucial that the Member States get behind Greece in some way. We are responsible for finding a solution to the Greek problem and I should like to repudiate here the statement by the British Member who spoke about the ‘Portugalisation’ of Europe. Perhaps the Portugalisation of Europe, in terms of values at least, would be no bad thing. I therefore reject this idea of trying, at bottom, to humiliate or belittle any people.

I wish that could have happened last year, when growth was considered to be a resulting effect of stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Still, I think that this important issue is going to be discussed very thoroughly because now the Commission has four tasks on its plate: to stabilise the eurozone, to introduce fiscal discipline and coordination, to stimulate growth and to help countries, like Greece, in economic distress. Sometimes the solutions to these problems are contradictory and controversial, so there should be a single and coherent policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Before working out the new plan, however, we have to make an assessment of the previous plans. What happened with the EUR 5 billion economic recovery plan that was adopted in 2009? Recently, we understood that the money for it had not been spent. What happened with the final Fiscal Compact? I am not one of its fervent supporters, but it has not been ratified even by countries that were pushing for it. What happened with the Euro-Plus Pact?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take stock of whatever has been achieved so far, and to see what measures could work in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am optimistic about the measures that the Commission has suggested and about which you, Commissioner Rehn, have informed us. But what is the value of a measure if it is not adopted and taken at the right time?</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council is going to agree on mutualisation of project bonds, and on ideas for the use of unspent funds, so that we can really achieve some success and not find ourselves discussing this issue again next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union, despite progress at Treaty level, reminds me of the Tower of Babel.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need today is not stability from austerity alone or from growth alone, but from a combination of both. Of course a country in deep debt, such as Greece, needs a programme of spending cuts and numerous structural changes in order to boost growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we Greeks have an obligation towards our lenders, but our current lenders are our partners. The Greek nation is aware of its obligations, but any nation in want that knows itself that its future is bleak can take desperate decisions in forthcoming elections. The history of Europe is full of similar examples, with tragic results.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, instead of maintaining or hinting that Greece is the problem and that it should leave the euro area, which no one in Greece really wants, let us all help to defuse the situation, ensure the problems are understood and find a balanced way forward, in keeping with the European economy and the social model. We can all utilise best practices from other countries, but theories about a ‘one size fits all’ model – such as the German model – are probably out of step with the inexorable truth. I doubt that tomorrow’s summit will generate any new ideas. Real solutions will need to overcome the entrenched attitude in the institutions. Europe is no longer the player which is certain to win in the global system.

Both of these aspects have been mentioned today in the form of fiscal stability and economic growth. Unfortunately, this pact has not been observed and budgetary imbalances have been created, resulting in austerity measures. It is therefore obvious that there is no sustainable economic growth without financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the austerity measures must be accompanied by measures promoting economic growth. Previous economic recovery programmes must be continued with specific measures. The Commission must propose programmes for supporting SMEs, also including loan guarantees or venture capital funds. The sums required can be provided by reallocating funds that have not been allocated or distributed so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Funds which have not been taken up for a variety of reasons must not be collected and returned to Member States, but redistributed to programmes supporting the economy. Ninety-five per cent of the EU budget is geared towards investment and generates economic growth and jobs. European policies and the European budget are obviously instruments which the European Union can use to intervene to support the economy. The regulations for the 2014-2020 common policies must include, to the maximum extent possible, measures for promoting growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2014-2020 budget must be approved as soon as possible so that Member States can plan their national policies. It would be a good idea for Chapter 1 of the MFF to be approved as an initial step, which refers to cohesion, transport, education, research and innovation, ICT and jobs. We must promote new financial instruments such as ‘project bonds’, for instance. I believe that reaching an agreement on own resources would mark a big step forward, as this agreement would ease the pressure on national contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They have given off an air of being slow, inadequate and fragmented, given that they have not been able to establish either a plan or a narrative. A list of measures does not make a plan, and to achieve a plan and narrative that can be deployed over time, which does not impose unrealistic conditions in impossible timeframes, the call for growth should be given some substance, as it has become empty words. And to achieve that, all the available resources need to be mobilised: the financial stability mechanism, the balance of which has not yet been used, and also the Structural Funds, the balances of which are yet to be utilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a need to clearly state that a fiscal agreement is not simply a budgetary corset to reduce costs, but rather to secure income, and this requires alleviation of the debt load, an increase in the European Central Bank’s firepower, and also the implementation of the European Treasury that issues eurobonds, which rationalise the partial sharing of Member States’ debts, currently called ‘sovereign’ debt. This also ensures the necessary income, via the innovation of the resources being discussed: the financial transaction tax, the all out fight against tax fraud and the eradication of tax havens.</p>
<p class="contents">Only this will allow us to convincingly talk about the light at the end of the tunnel, stating how much it is going to cost us, in such a way that the phrase ‘how much is it going to cost us?’ does not only invoke sacrifices, but also the necessary resources to serve and fulfil the objectives we are discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet what do right-wing leaders across Europe prescribe? More of the same medicine. When a patient is suffering, surely we do not want to cause more pain and more agony. We have a generation out of work. We have despair amongst our citizens and people taking to the streets. Plan A is not working so where is Plan B? We desperately need a plan to build for the future, a plan for jobs and growth and a plan to give hope for our young people. Let us hope that the election of Hollande will at last trigger a change of direction for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us get this straight. Despite what those on the right say, we are not calling just for more spending or for large deficits to be ignored. We are calling for the end to the dogma of austerity in favour of a more balanced plan, as in the US, Obama has a balanced deficit reduction while still creating jobs and generating growth. Let us hope that Hollande can show the leadership that Cameron, Merkel and Sarkozy have so dismally failed to deliver. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am no expert on public works, but people tell me that with that kind of money, you can barely build a metro system for a single city.

It is an economic, democratic and political crisis. You could even say that the current Greek tragedy is a European tragedy and we will only be able to resolve it together or go under together, which I hope will not be the case. This means that we must act together and we must not abandon Greece or, most importantly, the Greek people. What Greece needs is not just growth, but a green investment pact. Only 3% of Greece’s energy supply consists of solar energy and billions are being spent on oil and gas. This is an area where jobs can be created.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point to mention is the loopholes in the national tax systems. Mr Rehn has rightly said that two governments – my own government in Austria and the Luxembourg Government – are preventing progress from being made with the revised interest directive. This means that these two governments are supporting tax evasion and tax fraud. They are siding with the tax fraudsters and tax evaders. Therefore, I am calling on both these governments to agree to stop their blockade at the summit tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These voices testify to the fact that the crisis has not killed the fighting spirit in Europeans, and that we are still able to fight for a better tomorrow. I am pleased that the forthcoming informal European Union summit will concentrate on a policy of growth and employment. Most of the instruments for combating the crisis which have come into being recently focus mainly on disciplining national budgets, which, on its own, will not guarantee Europe either jobs or stable employment in the long term. Let us remember that budgetary discipline does not preclude measures for growth; quite the opposite – pro-growth measures should go hand in hand with austerity measures. It is only by acting in this way that we can restore secure growth to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for social investment, which should operate in a similar way to the economic ‘six-pack’, and should, with the consent of the Member States, be monitored by the European Commission. Rational use of funds from the budgets of the Union and the Member States and channelling this money through social investment will make the greatest contribution to growth in competitiveness and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lending more money, through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), for example, will only leave countries like Greece and Spain with bigger problems still.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, during this important debate, many of the honourable Members have touched on the single market, which finds itself – as I was saying yesterday – in a paradoxical situation. It is the first victim of the crisis, of unemployment, of the anxiety, despair and anger of many European citizens; yet, at the same time, it represents the main opportunity or asset in exiting the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make three brief observations on what we are doing to promote growth, and state, as many others have done, that we have felt for some time now that a growth initiative should be added to the fiscal and budgetary pact to ensure its success. Honourable Members, we have said this for some time and we are also taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this to Mr Verhofstadt, beyond these walls. For many months, not weeks, the Commission has worked on and proposed what could – if the Heads of State or Government so desire – make up the substance of this growth initiative: ‘project bonds’, previously mentioned by Olli Rehn; the tax on financial transactions; as regards the single market, with your support and following on from the Monti report and the report by Louis Grech that you have adopted, 40 proposals are before Parliament and the Council of Ministers, all of which have a positive impact on the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises or on consumers; the European patent; which is actively supported by the Danish Presidency; <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce; simplification of procurement contracts; venture capital; mobility; social entrepreneurship; and professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week, we will put forward a proposal on <span class="italic">e</span>-signatures, which should be one of the key areas in a very concrete issue, and which will perhaps enable us to make savings of EUR 100 billion each year. The issue in question is the digitisation of procurement contracts throughout Europe, then collective rights management. In a few weeks’ time, we will then put forward the second phase of the Single Market Act 2013, including 12 new proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we must act now; vote on these bills with the Council and create the conditions, the ecosystem needed by businesses – particularly the smallest and medium-sized ones – and consumers for their activities, and for the investments mentioned by Mr Swoboda earlier, or the ‘green growth’ mentioned by Ms Harms.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, honourable Members, we should go further and find once more the boldness that the founders of the European Coal and Steel Community showed at the very beginning of the European project. Imagine, for example, a European savings account that could take private savings and channel them to small and medium-sized enterprises, or laying the foundations of an industrial policy to protect those strategic technologies that we need to preserve our independence.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this: Corien Wortmann-Kool spoke of the implementation process, and I would like to prove her right. We will put forward radical reforms of how the single market is governed and rigorously check that our laws are implemented by the EU countries in the partnership. However, there will be a zero tolerance policy at the end of the partnership, and we will propose to incorporate this governance of the single market into the European Semester. Priority will be given to the effective implementation of the Services Directive, to enable it to fulfil its full potential, and to the digital single market.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, honourable Members, is this: what was to blame for growth stopping in Europe and throughout the Western world and the United States four years ago? It was the financial crisis – let us not forget this and neither the Commission nor Parliament will. It was the banks – some of which behaved irresponsibly, and it is clear that some bankers have indeed forgotten and have learned nothing – a lack of supervision, a lack of regulation and a gross distortion of free enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, for governance, growth and the social market economy to succeed, I recommend that we have strong, sound foundations for the financial markets, which should serve the real economy and not themselves. With your support, and with the greatest determination, it is here, too, that the Commission fulfils its agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, this package includes a number of initiatives on the demand for labour, on the need for more investment in skills, on the need for balanced labour market reforms and on helping mobility in the European Union in order to improve the situation and create jobs in the near future. It also includes action plans in three key areas, including green jobs, and we would like to work hand in hand with the Member States in order to implement this as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to raise awareness of this and put it into practice, we will hold a European employment conference in early September which will be opened by President Barroso and President Schulz, and closed by President Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many things we need to do in the area of employment, but top of the agenda is, of course, Youth. This is the biggest theme on which we have been working with the Danish Presidency i.e. the re-launch of the Youth guarantee programme. We are very active in reallocating EU Structural Funds (ESF) within the Member States which are most affected by youth unemployment in order to have projects that bring results faster and with greater efficiency. Together with Johannes Hahn, we went to the Member States on a number of occasions, including Greece, where there is a need for action and reinforcement of the implementation of the ESF. I can tell you that we managed to speed up the implementation of the Structural Funds in Greece with the help of the taskforce, but also in other countries like Romania – just to name a country which is outside the euro area but also in need of a lot of assistance in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">These efforts are very important. They are necessary but they will certainly be insufficient if we do not make progress with the macro-economic policies. That is why it is very important that progress is made in the coming weeks on the policies that Vice-President Rehn has championed, for example, putting forward the stability bonds which the Commission already did last October.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your many comments and proposals that I heard in the discussion, except for one, on the Thatcherite deregulation of the employment and social area in the European Union. I think this is a kind of obsession that has to be sidelined and we have to continue our work on the commitment to social rights, social cohesion and improving working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We need many reforms in the labour market, for example, pension reforms that help people to work longer. However, in order to ensure that, we have to approach this with a readiness to invest more and also protect those people who suffer from the consequences of mass unemployment in the European Union at this time. I believe we can continue on this track to ensure that social cohesion prevails and, at the same time, improve competitiveness and overcome the financial crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is our message for tomorrow’s informal summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the prevailing view of those who say that taking fiscal consolidation, on the one hand, and sustainable growth, on the other, and setting them against each other is really a false debate. Instead – in order to overcome the crisis and return to sustainable growth – we need to stay the course on fiscal consolidation while at the same time pursuing structural reforms which will enhance competitiveness, support the creation of more jobs and stimulate public and private investment that will give the needed extra fuel to our economic engine.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very grateful for your support for the EIB capital increase on project bonds for investment as well as for making more effective use of the Structural Funds. I also want to thank you for your overall support for a road map for stability bonds based on further reinforcement of economic governance – which is something that we have to reflect on and return to very soon and discuss together with the Member States and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a point on Greece. It is important that the summit will reaffirm its commitment to safeguard financial stability in, and integrity of, the euro area. We are fully aware of the efforts already made by Greek citizens; we encourage Greece to continue fiscal and structural reforms while respecting existing commitments which are the best guarantee for a more prosperous future inside the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">The recipe of restoring confidence in public finances and undergoing consistent structural reforms does work. Countries that have best weathered the storm during the crisis are indeed those that have gone through this kind of adjustment in their recent past. Just look at Denmark and the Netherlands in the 1980s; Finland and Sweden in the 1990s; Germany in the last decade; and today Ireland – while still undergoing difficult adjustment – has returned to recovery and growth. The Baltic States have recovered and we forecast three and half to four per cent economic growth for them next year. So it is indeed possible through this recipe. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to conclude by saying a few words on the quality and fundamental nature of growth. We have made – and continue to do so – growth and employment an absolute priority. Not just any old growth, however! Not growth that only entails injecting public money, in accumulating more debts and in sweeping our economies’ structural problems under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no sustainable growth without healthy, and thus sustainable, public accounts. There will be no sustainable growth unless structural reforms are implemented and our competitiveness and ability to create jobs are improved. There will be no sustainable growth without the completion of the single market. Finally, there will be no sustainable growth unless further effort is made to attract private and public investment in growth sectors where jobs are being created, such as research and innovation, energy and the green economy, and transport and communication infrastructures. The aim of our agenda is to support sustainable growth, employment and investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is abundantly clear that we all share a desire to increase growth and employment in Europe. The commitment shown in the debate today clearly proves this. Europe is in a severe economic crisis. Public budgets are in deficit, growth is poor and unemployment is high. Millions of young people in Europe are looking to this Parliament, looking to the Commission, looking to the Council, hoping that they can use their talents in the real world, and it is our job to give them that opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a response to the crisis. This response must focus on three elements: firstly, securing the stability of the European economies; secondly, regenerating growth; and finally, implementing structural reforms. Sound public finances are undoubtedly a central element of putting the Member States’ economies back on track for growth, which is vitally important for realising the potential of these economies. Nonetheless, I must stress that a strategy that does not also deliver on growth and jobs will not be capable of steering our Union out of the crisis. This is the reason why the jobs and growth dimension are so high on the Union’s and the Presidency’s agenda. At the same time, however, it is absolutely key that this entirely necessary growth policy is not made in a way that creates instability. It is therefore essential that the growth policy does not result in large public deficits. It is now up to the Member States to show the same commitment to the growth agenda as they have already demonstrated in relation to the consolidation agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased growth and jobs are, as I have said, a top priority for the Danish Presidency. This was a focal point of the European Councils in January and March, it is a focal point again at this week’s extraordinary European Council, and it will also be a focal point of the last European Council under the Danish Presidency. Creating jobs and growth is the Danish Presidency’s top priority. However, as others have also pointed out in the debate today, economic stability and consolidation are a precondition for achieving growth and employment, not a contradictory aim. We are already working in a number of areas, and the Presidency is pleased to have the cooperation of the Commission and the European Parliament. Where this Parliament is concerned, we are already cooperating closely on matters such as the internal market, the directive on energy efficiency and the EU’s multiannual financial framework. We now need to look at what further steps we can take together. Ladies and gentlemen, I am also pleased to be able to tell you that an agreement on project bonds has just been concluded between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This shows that we are all prepared to get down to business. The ball is now clearly in our court. The unemployed of Europe will show no patience if we do not do everything we can to deliver the goods. That is why we share a common task, regardless of which country we come from, regardless of which party we represent, regardless of whether we are members of the Commission, of Parliament or of the Council. Let us rise to this task together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Member States have been setting a good example in this regard, including the Netherlands of late. Measures to promote growth certainly can have a positive impact on the economy and the number of jobs, but not as a result of spending more government money, which increases deficits. They do so through bringing about reform and cutting unnecessary red tape, including at European level, and by collecting tax effectively and managing the available funds better and more intelligently. I ask the Council to establish ambitious targets in these areas at its informal summit. That way, growth and employment can be promoted without running up the deficits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU needs to take over the management of the Greek debt more quickly, as we are proposing with the debt redemption fund. In this way, we will be giving the affected population (the Greeks, but also the Spanish, the Portuguese and so on) prospects once again, as well as a guarantee that the EU will not leave them in the lurch.

In light of the current turmoil, increasing competitiveness and the creation of jobs are priority areas. We have set a goal whereby 75% of the population aged 20 to 64 years should be in employment; a high employment rate should, however, be a matter of course, but if we truly wish it to be so, the Member States should also identify with our efforts. They should have these goals in mind when they adopt measures and not only at a pan-European level. The growth deficit in Europe represents a serious threat to our future and, at this moment, we have to fight together with the aim of helping Europe recover from the crisis. We will not achieve growth and employment by means other than cooperation and investment. Growth and job creation depend on healthy and well-connected markets in which competition and consumers stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation; the European Union must become a more attractive place to invest. Let us not forget SMEs, which are the driving force behind the European economy, and let us also not forget scientific research, which is essential for the growth of productivity. Cuts alone will not help us overcome the crisis. They mainly affect the most vulnerable EU citizens, who are ultimately those who are most affected by the crisis, and we should combat this crisis in the spirit of modern social democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty-five million people in Europe are unemployed; in Greece and in Spain, half of all young people are unable to find employment, while in most other Member States, the figure is one-fifth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sad fact that the next generation is increasingly seeking to find its livelihood outside Europe. One-sided austerity measures that are not accompanied by economic invigoration have a serious impact on all strata of society except a narrow group comprising the wealthiest. Disappointment, hopelessness and social exclusion all work in favour of radical forces, as demonstrated by the results of the latest elections in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinion polls often show increasing support for populist and radical forces. The alarming facts and data before us prove that the crisis management efforts made so far were unsuccessful. If the Greek elections in June do not end in majority support for forces friendly towards Europe, we could be facing a disaster. This Mediterranean country could take the Member States on Europe’s periphery, as well as the Central and Eastern European region, down with it. It is finally beginning to dawn on Member State governments that have so far rejected the solutions long advocated by the left wing that in order to avert an even greater disaster, in addition to responsible fiscal policy, we also need economic invigoration measures, an intensification of European integration, the realisation of solidarity and the elimination of the internal imbalances in the euro area. The participants of the summit on Wednesday will finally need to decide on the specific steps to be taken in order to achieve all this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, the European Parliament adopted, along with the Council, a package of measures for tightening economic management, whose aim is to discipline countries and improve the management of their public finances. This unquestionably improves coordination and has a positive impact on the EU’s stability as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we saw that this was not sufficient for us to emerge from the crisis. Fiscal discipline needs to be accompanied by measures to stimulate growth and establish the preconditions for creating new jobs. In this regard, we must focus particular attention on small and medium-sized businesses which have been hard hit. However, the difficulty in accessing funding and the long-winded procedures are only some of the problems facing business nowadays. The financial instruments developed by the European Commission must play an important role in supporting SMEs. However, in order to make them effective, an adapted approach is required to include indicators for assessing the results, as well as greater transparency in terms of the programmes’ operation. In addition to this, the functioning of the single market needs to be improved and the administrative burden needs to be reduced, especially for SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is whether this will be accompanied by an economic turning point. Will the European Union finally discard its conservative economic policy which focuses solely on deficit reduction?</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Greece, as well as the difficulties facing Spain, Portugal and Ireland, clearly show that austerity measures alone are not enough. There is only so much European society can endure, yet the elimination of deficit would require years or even decades. We must find a new economic model, an alternative to the free-market capitalism that caused the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning the reason why Scandinavian countries were able to withstand the crisis effectively. These countries finance their broad social benefits from high taxes, while their financial and banking systems are subject to strict rules. European countries must turn their attention towards investments that serve long-term growth, such as infrastructure and energy network modernisation, research and development, the elimination of abject poverty and the development of education. The costs of such investments should not be disregarded during deficit calculations for the Stability and Growth Pact.

On this occasion, Heads of State or Government should identify and devise new policies in support of economic growth in the EU. During the summit, special attention must be focused on measures for creating new jobs, especially for young people among whom the unemployment rate has passed the 20% mark. On the subject of the Structural Funds, they should be channelled into making Member States more competitive and increasing economic and social cohesion. Member States with a poor rate of absorption should be given help to speed up the use of the Structural Funds in areas and projects helping create new jobs. Given that, in recent years, industrial production has declined in many of the Member States, with a powerful impact on jobs across the EU, I think that the EU should make better use of strategic partnerships with third countries for acquiring their raw materials and supporting industrial production across Europe, as well as the EU’s exports and economic interests.
