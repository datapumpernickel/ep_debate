<p class="contents">It is no big surprise that you have reconfirmed the views that were expressed last autumn and once again called on the Commission to withdraw its proposal. I know and I understand Parliament’s concerns about voluntary modulation. My position is no secret to you, and a repetition of your arguments and of my arguments is not necessary, but we have to face reality. Turning to solutions other than voluntary modulation, I would have preferred to ensure sufficient funding in our rural development policy, but the European Summit decided otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is very clear to me: the European Parliament’s concerns do not fall on deaf ears. Although the Council has reaffirmed its wish to maintain its proposal, efforts are currently being made to accommodate your concerns. There have been concerns that voluntary modulation would unravel the common agricultural policy, but, as it stands now, all of the indicators are that voluntary modulation will only be used in a very limited number of Member States to boost their own rural development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will recall, we have proposed that the money has to be spent in line with almost all of the rules governing rural development. Furthermore, I believe that it is appropriate for Member States intending to apply voluntary modulation to carry out an impact assessment before its implementation, and we should also make sure to monitor carefully the implementation of the voluntary modulation, in particular as regards the economic situation of farmers. I believe also that this instrument should have a transitional, rather than permanent, character. Indeed, I am of the opinion that any future increase in the rate of compulsory modulation should lead to a corresponding reduction of the rate of voluntary modulation. Efforts to make such provisions within the context of this proposal would have the Commission’s full support.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, it is my intention to look at voluntary and compulsory modulation when we have a discussion on the health check of the common agricultural policy. All in all, the Commission remains open to exploring feasible suggestions that may result in a compromise that is acceptable to Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to be constructive, but you will also have to be constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to close by raising an issue of great concern to me. We are on the verge of a new generation of rural development programmes. Member States have already invested in drafting sound national strategy plans and programmes to achieve the objectives to which the European Parliament is committed, i.e. competitive agriculture and forestry, environmental performance, creation of jobs and a lively social fabric in rural areas. We are at a crucial time for enabling a smooth start to these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The 20 % reserve in commitment and payment appropriations for rural development which the European Parliament has taken threatens to put this into danger. I am very concerned about this link and the fundamental problem it creates for the start of the new rural development policy. Mrs Grybauskaitė and I have outlined our concerned in detail in a joint letter to the chairmen of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets. The reserve impedes a proper implementation of rural development policy. As Parliament strongly supports this policy, I hope that you will understand the problem that the reserve will cause. The reserve creates additional uncertainties and difficulties for Member States to design programmes, and this against a background of the reserve cuts in the rural development budget decided at the summit in December 2005. Approval of the rural development programmes will be delayed and the Commission can only start approving programmes if the appropriations required for all the programmes in the Union are available in the budget. Consequently, if the Commission cannot commit the 100 % amounts, Member States will have to withdraw their programmes or their proposals and submit revised proposals that take into account the reduction of the 20 %. If the reserve is lifted later, all rural development programmes will then have to be adapted accordingly and you might understand that this risks hampering the uptake of the programmes in the delicate starting phase.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to find an acceptable solution on voluntary modulation, but, meanwhile, let us not take our rural programmes as hostages. I count on you in resolving these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can of course discuss all the other aspects, but perhaps not just now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is quite right in saying that it is not the first time that we have discussed the pros and cons of voluntary modulation in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Since our last debate, not much has changed in terms of the legislative proposal. It is true that the Council and the Commission have sent us clear signals that they are willing to accommodate our concerns, but, until this is definite, we must reiterate our clear signal that we reject this proposal in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">The total disregard for Parliament’s political and budgetary codecision powers with regard to the final agreement in the Council is a further demonstration that, not only do the other institutions fail to take us seriously in important matters of principle, they fail to notice us at all. This has to change, Constitution or no Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the Council and the Commission make us a firm offer, therefore, we should be united in rejecting this proposal. This is the only way to achieve results, and I believe that, if we do so, this issue will help to strengthen the role of the EP and, in particular, to support European farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to reiterate my thanks to all the members of my committee for having joined me on this path thus far. I should also like to extend the warmest of thanks to the members of the Committee on Budgets and the representatives of all the political groups for supporting the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on its difficult path. On behalf of many, I should like to give particular mention to Mr Mulder and Mr Bösch, who have made a vital contribution to determining the position of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to my fellow Members to unite in voting against the Commission proposal tomorrow. Let us join with the Council and the Commission to seek ways of achieving a better solution. I would remind the House, however, that rejecting the proposal is a precondition for spurring the Council in particular, but also the Commission, into action. I hope for your unqualified support, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address the following remark of a procedural nature to the President. The second report on voluntary modulation confirms the first report, which also rejected the Commission proposal, and the matter was thus referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure. If we reject the Commission proposal again tomorrow, and the Commission does not withdraw its proposal – which I am assuming it will not – we shall also have to vote on the draft legislative resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to them, all the institutions now take the European Parliament and its Members more seriously. I am convinced that we shall be able to find a solution together. Indeed, the Commissioner has already dropped a good many hints. The Council, too, must budge at long last, however, and I think that that will indeed be possible as part of constructive talks.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the first vote, the principle applies that there should be no dilution of the common agricultural policy – which remains the only EU policy that has really been brought within the Community sphere – and no renationalisation of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s existence is based on solidarity and respect, including respect for all individuals. In the last 15 years, European agriculture has undergone far-reaching reforms unparalleled in any other European policy. As the Commissioner has already mentioned, we are looking into the ‘health check’, the discussion on which starts next year, so that we shall be prepared for the years following 2013. It is particularly important that we in this House continue to take a consistent line across all committee and group divides, as this is the only way of ensuring that Parliament and its representatives do not continue to be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I ask all my fellow Members to follow the recommendation of our rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs tomorrow, as you did at the first vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the European Commission has not amended its text, the stage is still set for that text to be rejected again; everyone knows the reasons, so I shall not repeat them: the cuts made to the second pillar, the omission of cofinancing, the fact that cofinancing introduces distortions of competition between States and the imbalance that creates in the structure of the common agricultural policy which, I might point out, is the only common European policy and is at risk of being renationalised as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural development policy’s need for funding is nevertheless real and I really do fear a growing depopulation of our rural areas if nothing is done to modernise farming structures, to renew generations of farmers, to improve the quality of life and the environment and to encourage economic diversity in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Commissioner, I am asking you, instead of voluntary modulation, to propose an increase in the rate of compulsory modulation, making it identical in all Member States. I would also like to stress that, at present, compulsory modulation applies where a farm receives more than EUR 5 000 in aid a year, which means the vast majority of farms.</p>
<p class="contents">A proper tool for redistributing agricultural aids would also take account of other criteria, such as the size of the farm, its dependence on aid, the labour employed, the gross margin, etc. As well as that, there could also be a ceiling on direct aid to make for better distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, even if the European Parliament rejects this proposal overwhelmingly for a second time, a proposal which would normally be an important legislative act, it is only an opinion, and I agree fully with Mr Goepel. I therefore believe we should keep up the pressure on the Commission and the Council while for the time being retaining the 20% budget reserve for the rural development funds for 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, both in his defence of agriculture and for his role as watchdog regarding the competence of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is based on the decision by the European Council, when it compromised on multiannual financial frameworks. According to the compromise, a Member State could cut direct payments for agriculture by up to 20% and use the money for rural development in any way it wishes. Voluntary modulation would therefore be an additional tax that the Member State could levy against its farmers. On top of this, of course, farmers would be burdened with the statutory taxes in the Member State concerned. The system would reduce their income without in any way compensating them. A Member State could use the modulated sum for rural development in place of its own contribution, so modulation would not even increase the funds available for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary modulation would upset the delicate balance that has been created between the different Member States of the European Union and the regions, and would give their farmers unequal status. It would distort the common market. On the other hand, voluntary modulation would move funds around within the EU budget. In particular, the amounts for, and the relation between, compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure would change. Moreover, the European Parliament would not have any say in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The classification of expenditure and the amounts set aside for it are precisely defined in an interinstitutional agreement, so the change would be contrary to this and would mean that the agreement would have to be amended. It is unthinkable that the Council should intend to breach an interinstitutional agreement a full month after it took effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the common agricultural policy is to guarantee stable, clear and equal conditions for farmers in the practice of their profession. Voluntary modulation would conflict dramatically with these principles. The EU’s right to exist, its very legitimacy, relies on fair and balanced policies. Voluntary modulation does not meet these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s funds should be used for the purpose for which they were intended in the budget. If Member States start channelling EU money to patch up their own budgets, the entire EU budget policy will be undermined. The answer is now in the hands of the Council and the Commission, including the 20% reserve for rural development funds. We would have had the answer a long time ago if the Commission and the Council had negotiated with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We say NO to attempts to discriminate against farmers and make them bear the cost of the rural development programme, for which sufficient funding should be found from the European Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, there has been talk about the possibility of discriminating against farmers, which is against the treaties, re-nationalisation of the common agricultural policy, and distortion of competition. I would like to remind you that in many of the new Member States, farmers were subjected to discrimination during the accession period, and free competition was indeed restricted in farming. For many years the new Members received lower subsidies. These subsidies are only likely to become equal to those received by the old Member States by the time the general cuts in CAP expenditure come into effect. Excluding beneficiaries receiving less than EUR 5 000 from the modulation is hard to understand. These payments go to small farms. If at the end of the day some form of restrictions on payments is introduced, the ceiling should be raised to EUR 50 000. Larger farms are more easily able to deal with the loss of subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has reduced the funds for rural development, against the recommendations of the Commission and Parliament – we had been in agreement on this – by EUR 20 billion. We do not now need to feel responsible for the Council’s nonsense. If such proposals had come from Parliament, we would have been a laughing stock.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, we said we wanted to contemplate cofinancing as a means of providing funds if they ran short. We want the first and second pillars to be treated alike in terms of Member States’ payments. None of this has happened. The current situation is that, in Germany, for example, the second-pillar funds are being reduced by 40%, and naturally we have to ask the German Government to apply 20% voluntary modulation to compensate for this. We cannot accept such nonsense at European level, however, as there are better proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission says – as the Council has also done – that putting this in the reserve will mean rural areas and development being taken hostage, that is incorrect. We are the ones defending the development of the rural economy and putting a stop to the Council’s nonsense. If the Council does not present better proposals or adopt better proposals of the Commission’s, we shall have to resort to other measures on which Parliament has powers of codecision, which we would not otherwise have had. Common sense is on the side of Parliament rather than the Council in this matter.

The Commission has finally tabled a proposal. Whilst it is not perfect, it is a good start in that it gives Member States more freedom in how they spend their agricultural funds, without jeopardising the income of small farmers.

Firstly, voluntary modulation by its very nature amounts to a snatch and grab of farmers’ resources by national governments. There is nothing voluntary about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it accentuates inequality across Europe and distorts the market, with only the United Kingdom, it seems, committed to fleecing its farmers through voluntary modulation. Compulsory modulation is bad enough, but at least it is evenly spread.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, unlike the previous scheme, this proposal does not compel Member States to produce matching funding so, in reality, in my constituency, the anti-farming UK Government will not produce such funding. The result is a double deficit to UK farmers, extra top-slicing of their single farm payment and no matching funding from the Exchequer into the rural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it stifles essential local variation by prohibiting regional approaches, something which the outgoing scheme permits. Both pillar one and pillar two policies are in the main devolved matters within the United Kingdom, hence the logic of permitting local variation in the modulation rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly and finally, the Commission proposal continues to have a franchise provision which allows some to escape paying, leaving others to have to pay more. So, for those reasons, just as I voted against this tawdry regulation in November, I will do so again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you know very well you do not like the Council proposal, and you know that, under the institutional agreements, you have to put it forward. Now, we are listening to what you are saying, but we dislike the voluntary modulation intensely, so we are waiting for a new proposal to come forward. I think the best way we can deal with this is to get on with it, to reject it again and for you to come forward with a proposal very quickly, because we are all interested in rural development but we are also interested in a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point that Mr Allister made, this is not voluntary modulation to all those farmers that lose their payments. Perhaps we should actually offer it to them and say ‘will you voluntarily lose 20 % of your payment?’ I suspect not many of them would come forward and say ‘yes’. So this is very much compulsory modulation, but probably only done to two Member States, the United Kingdom and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only will it not be voluntary, but it will not even be uniformly applied across the UK, because our present Government wants to have different levels of modulation throughout the UK. So, in the area that I represent, South-West England, which borders Wales, there is a good chance that there will be a totally different modulation on one side of the border to the other. Probably English farmers will be at least 20 or 25 % worse off than their Welsh counterparts. As you quite rightly say, we need an impact assessment; we actually want that on the table. That should have been brought forward by the Council and perhaps we would have looked at this more sympathetically. Therefore, as I said, we are ready to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also good to see Brian Simpson here tonight, because last time we debated it there was nobody from the Labour Party here to defend the Council’s position. At least, perhaps, they are listening to us.</p>

They have done an excellent job, as someone already said. In this debate, it is not just about the subject of voluntary modulation but mainly about parliamentary democracy, in other words what are this Parliament’s rights in the area of rural development, and suchlike. I should also like to thank Commissioner Fischer Boel. She has always approached Parliament with an open mind and even in the individual talks, she invariably spoke frankly.</p>
<p class="contents">A great many things have been said. Why am I opposed to the system of voluntary modulation? Firstly, because it strikes at the roots of the common agricultural policy, which is wrong, and, secondly, because it trifles with Parliament’s budgetary rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has to steer a course between the Council and Parliament. In May, we drew up financial perspectives, in which Parliament clearly stated its opinion on this voluntary modulation. The Commission proposals are no more than a reflection of the Council’s opinions, which is something I find reprehensible. Parliament’s wishes have hardly been taken into consideration. Something that is beyond me is that, at a time when everyone in Europe talks about involving the citizen in Europe more, the Commission completely ignores Parliament’s position!</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the Commissioner's words when she implied at the end that a compromise was possible. Of course, Parliament would be happy with a compromise. We too are in favour of rural development, but we are also in favour of these common markets. We need to find a solution on the basis of these two key concepts. Is it possible, as was the case in the past, to make an exception for certain countries? Is it possible in future to make more intelligent use of the compulsory modulation and gear it towards certain wishes, as Parliament has formulated in the past? This could, for example, be done with this Health Check. If the outcome of tomorrow’s vote is that Parliament’s position is confirmed once again, then the time has come for the Commission to take the initiative for a compromise that is realistic and acceptable to the Council and Parliament. Indeed, the rights of Parliament and of the Council in the area of rural policy are exactly the same and the Commission would do well to take Parliament’s views into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In drawing up the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, both the Council and Commission knew full well that cutting funding for rural areas from EUR 88 billion to EUR 69 billion would result in a painful shortage of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempting to correct expenditure on the CAP and particular elements of it has only led to confusion and deepened regional imbalances. Trying to remedy this mistake by cutting direct payments – and impoverishing farmers in the process – is the worst of all possible solutions. The proposed nationalisation of the CAP through an additional voluntary modulation of 20% is further evidence of inconsistency in shaping the CAP, and an attempt to re-nationalise it. Ladies and gentlemen, we therefore have no choice but to reject the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As others have said, voluntary modulation of agriculture payments is not voluntary at all for the farmers who lose out, only for the Member States who are fleecing their budget. The higher compulsory modulation funded across the EU has some logic but only the London Government would argue that Scotland’s farmers should lose out by 20% against their continental colleagues and it is right that we reject this flawed proposal. If we do not reject it, we accept a poor proposal which has been brought before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">But in so doing I would stress to our Commissioner that we need to see as much subsidiarity as possible in any eventual package that is brought forward. The Scottish Parliament is not yet a full Member State parliament, but it is responsible for agriculture and food matters in Scotland and it is right that the Scottish Parliament, whoever is in charge of it, should remain the relevant authority for these matters, because whoever is in charge of it will do a better job than the London Government will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development keeps rejecting this proposal and the Commission keeps on batting it back. If nothing else this ping pong tournament clearly shows the pointlessness of this Parliament and its committees.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament is supposed to represent democracy in the EU, so why is it that the Commission shows it such contempt? Possibly because it knows that in reality this Parliament is a sham of democracy, a glorified talking shop with little or no meaningful influence over anything.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Independence Party finds itself in the unusual position of being against giving the British Government more freedom, in this case to siphon off CAP funds away from food production and into nebulous rural development schemes which could mean anything from maintaining village greens to building theme parks or running animal reserves. We are, after all, supposed to be talking about the common agricultural policy and not the common rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The British farming community needs support. It is not the healthy option for my country to move away from producing its own food. A country should not be reliant on imports to feed itself, and this is where Britain is heading if we take money away from genuine farming and instead pour it into feel-good environmental projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Independence Party is no supporter of the EU and its subsidy regime. But while Britain remains a member, we might as well ensure that the funding we receive – which is merely our own money that the EU sees fit to return to us anyway – is spent in the right place.</p>

Agricultorii români, de exemplu, beneficiază în prezent doar de un sfert din plăţile pe care le primesc fermierii din vechile state membre, urmând ca în zece ani să atingă nivelul comun al Uniunii.</p>
<p class="contents">Modularea obligatorie, cumulată cu cea facultativă, vor face ca acest nivel comun al Uniunii să fie destul de redus în momentul în care agricultorii români vor putea beneficia de el. Această ţintă mişcătoare poate destabiliza atât piaţa românească, cât şi pe cea europeană, deoarece agricultorii nu pot planifica nici măcar pe termen scurt, necunoscându-şi veniturile viitoare.</p>
<p class="contents">În plus, termenul de facultativ induce în eroare. O dată adoptată de către statele membre, modularea devine obligatorie pentru fermieri, putând duce la scăderea plăţilor directe la hectar cu până la 25%. Acest proces contribuie la renaţionalizarea politicii agricole comune, adică la o modificare a acestei politici, simbol al solidarităţii europene.</p>
<p class="contents">În al doilea rând, propunerea Comisiei este injustă, întrucât ignoră participarea noastră la dezbaterea viitorului financiar al Uniunii. Vocea Parlamentului trebuie să se facă auzită convingător, atât înainte, cât şi în timpul controlului de sănătate planificat pentru 2008-2009. Noi nu putem porni pe acest drum cu concluzii deja luate, iar introducerea modulării facultative duce tocmai la un rezultat cunoscut dinainte al controlului de sănătate. Mai mult, din câte ştiu, Comisia nu a efectuat studiul de impact necesar prevăzut în acordul interinstituţional cu Parlamentul European. Toate aceste elemente fac din propunerea de regulament a Comisiei un compromis nedorit de nimeni ale cărui victime vor fi însă fermierii europeni. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot agree with the reasons given in the report, which lead to entirely different conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that I do not have time to demonstrate this as thoroughly as I would like, but I should like to ask what better study there could be than the one in which the figures reveal the current injustice of the redistribution of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP). As for cofinancing, is it not the case that forcing the Member States with fewer resources to contribute with their own budgets to common policies is tantamount to renationalising the CAP?</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this report is characterised by a conservative attitude, which I do not share. I must condemn the fact that it rides roughshod over the subsidiarity principle, and that it clearly seeks to protect the major beneficiaries of the CAP. I must also register my protest at Parliament's proposal, as revealed in the Goepel reports, to freeze 20% of the funds for rural development for 2007. Farmers must not be held to ransom by the disputes between the institutions.

In effect, these proposals would mean the transfer of 20 % of funds from direct payments and market support of the CAP to rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support investment in rural development; indeed, I think it is crucial if rural areas are to contribute to the Lisbon Agenda. But this investment cannot come out of the pockets of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said earlier tonight that you were afraid of the dangers to rural development if we reject this proposal. But what of the dangers to agriculture if this proposal were to proceed? And, speaking of the pockets of farmers, this proposal would be a drastic cut in some farmers’ incomes. If we take the initial amount of the direct payments to farmers at 100 %, take away 5 % for compulsory modulation, a further 8 % approximately for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria – who are in no way responsible for the fact that we did not make proper funding provision – and if you are then to take a further 20 % for voluntary modulation, those farmers will have lost approximately 33 %, – one third – of their income as was promised in the CAP reform.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is not just about money. Voluntary modulation as proposed would distort competition between Member States. It would, in effect, be a renationalisation of the CAP and, in my opinion, jeopardise the security of food production in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I know we both agree that agriculture needs stability. When you came to the Irish Parliament last year you said, ‘I wish to give farmers in Ireland and the rest of the EU as much stability as possible’. But this is a difficult and uncertain time for farmers. If they were just to listen to today’s debates in Parliament, with Commissioner Mandelson speaking earlier of further flexibility in the context of the WTO and, tonight, the possibility of the renationalisation of CAP, they would be even more uncertain.</p>

With such a majority, the European Parliament rejected more than clearly the proposal for a Council regulation on the voluntary modulation of direct payments.

Never before has this House been so negative about something that not a single positive aspect of it could be found. For this reason, in looking for something positive about modulation, without going into details such as whether 20% is the right level or EUR 5 000 is the right amount, I have indeed found some positive features.</p>

Secondly, it will take the wind out of the sails of critics of the EU. We recently heard how the EU wants to regulate everything, including the shape of bananas, the size of peas, and so forth. Here we would have at least 20% proof that we do not want to regulate everything down to such detail. Thirdly, implementing the modulation would make common measures to rebuild and modernise rural areas possible. But for these actions to be supported by farmers, we should firstly make it possible for rural authorities to decide on …</p>

<p class="contents">I also take the opportunity to remind all British MEPs from all political parties that support for rejection will have serious consequences for the UK’s rural development spending plans and, in effect, you will be voting for a massive cut of over EUR 1.2 billion in British rural areas over the next 6 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I also remind all Members of the House that, due to the low allocation of rural development money received by the UK compared to other Member States, the voluntary modulation system is not only needed but also essential in delivering ambitious and effective rural development programmes in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to spend a little time assessing what all this means, just as a way of highlighting the importance of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, voluntary modulation will allow the UK to deliver a much broader range of environmental outcomes in line with stated EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, whilst appreciating the political sensitivities surrounding Parliament’s right, we must surely focus on the potential of securing real and genuine development gains for rural areas. For example, we can give payments to farmers under agri-environment schemes designed to deliver environmental and biodiversity benefit; we can support hill farmers and farmers in the uplands; we can work on schemes to help mitigate the effect of climate change through support for energy crops and other renewable energy products and we can help protect our countryside in key natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is put at risk by Parliament’s attitude towards voluntary modulation and that is why Labour Party MEPs will vote against the committee’s short-sighted recommendation. Without voluntary modulation, the UK will only be able to honour existing contracts, falling far short of what we would like to do.</p>

We must break the impasse between the Council and Parliament. New projects for European rural areas should not be put at risk. I would urge you to give the Member States an opportunity to make more funds available for this purpose within a European strategy for rural areas, landscape and nature. The future of European agricultural policy lies in phasing out income support, initially of the largest farmers, but at the same time in investing in the rural areas. If Parliament once again opts for a barrier, with the lever of blocking 20% of the rural budget, it would be opting for a repeat scenario, while more than anything, it is fresh policy we need for all countryside dwellers. By blocking EUR 2.48 billion, many sound projects would be at risk of derailing. In the case of the Netherlands, EUR 14 million would be involved, a trifling sum, but amounting to a great deal for those concerned. All these plans for a vital countryside should not fall prey to a Brussels conflict. We must look for different weapons, and the Council must also make a move. The compromise may well involve more compulsory modulation for all Member States. This would amount to creaming off more funds from the subsidies for the largest farmers, for the benefit of investing in rural areas. No 5%, as is now the case, but 15%, if 20% proves too high for the Council. The bigger the farmer, the more modulation. That too only seems fair. This is something to which the Commission should turn its attention. The European rural areas cannot make plans now and farmers do not know where they stand. This is irresponsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we are here again, and have to confront a proposal we have already rejected once. However, we must vote against it not only because no substantial change has been made, but above all because several points of the proposal raise serious concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, because it leads to the cancellation of the common agricultural policy, given that it seeks to reduce the latter to the national level. Moreover, the various Member States would use this opportunity to different degrees, depending on their differing budgetary situations, and this would lead to serious distortion of competition. We cannot allow farmers, who are already struggling, to be disadvantaged as a result of certain Member States’ tighter budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we are all aware that regulation has to be harmonised with the agreement reached by the Council in 2005, but we need to examine every option carefully, in order to be able to change the regulations in a consistent and appropriate manner. Therefore, the report in its current state is unacceptable. We need to find a solution that will make farmers’ lives better, and not place them in a more difficult situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that the proposal on voluntary modulation has to be seen in the broader context, which is about the whole financing of the common agricultural policy in general and the rural development policy in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary modulation certainly is not the best tool to achieve the strengthening of the second pillar. I agree on that. But as I have stressed during the debate today, efforts are being made to try and accommodate the concerns that have been raised in the European Parliament. These efforts will be pursued in the coming days and weeks, as I spelled out in my introduction. The Commission is prepared to make its bid to ensure that the result achieved takes into account as many of the concerns that have been raised as possible. I hope that we will be able to achieve a compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would remind the Commission that the CAP agreement is in place until 2013. As it is, the mandatory levels of modulation are already causing hardships in rural areas of my constituency. This proposal implies the re-nationalisation of agricultural policy, however, it takes no account of the fact the direct payments will then be at the discretion of Member States, with no way to monitor the spending of funds. Also, the proposal does not provide for any alternatives to farming, nor does it contain a procedure to ensure that a farmer’s competitive position will not deteriorate disproportionately. In some countries, taking money from agriculture and giving it to rural areas may work, but in many parts of Ireland agriculture is the basis of rural life. Without agriculture, the men and women in rural Ireland experience depopulation or are forced to tolerate polluting industries to provide jobs and keep people in the area. In Ireland, the more money we move from agriculture to rural, the more we damage both. An impact assessment would have predicted this.</p>
