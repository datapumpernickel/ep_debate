But aside from this serious issue, it has left us with an institutional crisis, a market crisis, a drop in sales of beef products, a drop in prices and, most importantly, a consumer confidence crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation under discussion has come too late, much too late in my opinion, but all the same it will help to provide some answers, some solutions and it will help us to take some action to restore consumer confidence. As you will recall, we fought a hard battle over this regulation last December in order to protect the rights of the European Parliament. We also fought a battle to push through the implementation of the measures laid down in this regulation as swiftly as possible. In short, we all know what we are talking about. On the basis of this regulation, very soon, this year, all bovine animals will, by law, have to be identified and monitored right up to slaughter. Meat from bovine animals will carry a label indicating the origin and history of the animals from which the meat is derived. </p>
<p class="contents">During our analysis of this regulation, we tried to cater for a great many demands and a great many opinions. We wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as simple as possible so that they could be applied, and applied as quickly as possible. Let us not forget that the system we are going to implement is an extremely complex, extremely technical system, and concerns approximately 100 million animals throughout the EU. So we are talking about an extremely complex operation. The system therefore needs to be simple and practicable and it needs to be comprehensible to the consumer; this is of utmost importance to us. Above all, it must not contain exceptions or what we call loopholes, i.e. ways in which the regulation can be contravened either through complex wording or because of local or special exceptions or applications. I believe that we have managed to achieve this. The system that Parliament is endeavouring to establish though its amendments could be applied from 1 September 2000 onwards and we insist on this because one demand of the entire House was that specific dates and deadlines should be set at long last and that we should get started. </p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to look at two amendments, two categories of amendments. First, your rapporteur is calling, with the greatest respect, for a report, a Commission proposal, within the year, on the application of this system to meat products. If we want to be taken seriously, we should also take account of consumer confidence in all meat products, of which, as we all know, there are a great many. And secondly, some amendments deal with how permits are to be granted to enterprises, operators and so on to apply the labels, to label the meat. The provisions recommended by the Commission are, to my mind, extremely minimal. The interested party submits an application and, after a period of time, the system which he wishes to apply is applied. I propose that we change this system. Anyone labelling meat must have explicit approval from the competent public authorities. This may seem a little more laborious, but we already have a laborious system and we must, at all costs, have state approval for meat labelling. If not, then I am afraid that the system will become too lax and may even become corrupt, and, as a result, we will not achieve our main goal of winning consumer confidence in the system.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important objective of the Commission proposal – and I should like expressly to stress this once again – is the traceability of beef or bovine animals from birth through to processing and sale.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the consequences of the BSE crisis and we must bear the objective of this proposal, i.e. traceability, in mind when debating what information should appear on the label. We want labels which are practicable, simple, safe, cheap and easy to control. Labels must be easy for consumers to understand, which is why the information needs to be kept to a minimum. Consumers want information, not a novel.</p>
<p class="contents">Information on the fattening process and, where applicable, on antibiotics or other stimulants administered, as demanded in proposed Amendment No 48, have absolutely no business to be on the label. Information which does not come under compulsory labelling but which is requested by market participants or is already included on labels in the Member States can continue to be included within the framework of voluntary labelling. This applies in particular to information on the region of origin of the meat.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the entry into force of the regulation is concerned, we agree in principle with the Commission’s approach that compulsory labelling should be introduced in two stages, but we do not agreed with the timetable insofar as we think that the date of 1 January 2003 has been put far too far back.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have problems explaining this to consumers. The Committee on Agriculture agreed on the wording “by 1 January 2002 at the latest” in a compromise on the introduction of compulsory information on origin, i.e. stage 2. Now the Committee on the Environment has opted for 1 September 2001 and I think that we can agree to this date. It is only a matter of four months. But we are emphatically against making all the information, including the indication of the place of birth, compulsory when the regulation enters into force in September 2000, rather than in two stages. That makes no sense, as the electronic database on which traceability depends is not yet up and running in the majority of Member States. A compulsory labelling system for beef can only be as good as the system for registering bovine animals and all their movements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, beef labelling has two distinct functions. Firstly, traceability in the case of a food safety incident – the recent E. coli outbreak in Scotland for example – and, secondly, to give consumers information about the origin of beef at the point of sale. The two should not be confused. For traceability we need maximum information made available to the authorities as and when required but the consumer label should be simple, concise and unambiguous.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for information sprang from the BSE crisis. Member States have differing levels of BSE incidence but there are also variations in the measures to eradicate the disease and protect human health. Although the United Kingdom has the highest incidence of BSE, it also has the most comprehensive control measures. Other countries, which admittedly have lower declared levels of BSE, operate a whole-herd slaughter policy which entails the risk of the under-reporting of cases. Therefore people want to know which country their beef comes from.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference to regions should not be an alternative to country of origin but a voluntary addition. Even regions like Yorkshire, Britain’s premier region and coincidentally the region I represent, are not known by every citizen throughout the EU. From a marketing and promotional point of view smaller areas and localities could be used, as well as regional breeds such as Aberdeen Angus. The well established description of Scotch beef should continue to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Small traditional butcher shops that sell beef unpackaged should be allowed to display information as an alternative to labelling each item. Many consumers would be confused if given information about hanging or maturation, which could be mixed up with sell-by dates in their minds.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw attention particularly to Amendment No 41 which seeks to exclude farmers from Community aid schemes if the regulation is not strictly adhered to. I have already had cases drawn to my attention regarding other EU schemes where honest errors by farmers, who are not professional bureaucrats, have resulted in punitive sanctions which often threaten the future of a family farm. We should not go down this road. The listing of antibiotics and stimulants that might have been administered would, if adopted, create a two-tier beef market. Animal welfare would be compromised as farmers would be reluctant to treat animals therapeutically. Similarly, reference to fattening methods should not be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in amending this regulation Parliament can for once simplify rather than embellish and make the labelling of beef consumer-, butcher- and farmer-friendly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, my group welcomed the report by Mr Papayannakis and salutes him for his persistence. I say that because he comes from a small political group – and it is often hard to make headway here – and he comes from one of the southern Member States, which will in some ways have to make sacrifices and introduce regulations to bring about effective, proper beef labelling throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">He has also had to face the obfuscation and delays brought about by the Council. The fact that we have had to wait two years for this proposal to become a practical reality is a poor comment on the urgency with which they regard it, although the situation was plainly critical from the time of the outbreak of the BSE crisis onwards. However, we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead. This is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has the opportunity, if it is willing to grasp it, to set a realistic timetable for the two-tier implementation of a comprehensive process of labelling for beef and for beef products.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we supported most of the amendments from the rapporteur and others and we do so again today. We do that on the basis that the key proposal plainly has to be the issue of timing. Some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave. We are now talking about implementation of the first stage in September 2000 and the second stage in September 2001. I was glad to hear the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development say that they would settle for the four-month advance that would involve coming forward from January 2002. We believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole European Union on the move.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want the second stage as set out in Article 13(5) to be distinct and a commensurate advance. Why do we want that? There are some here – certainly some from Member States that have very effective traceability and labelling possibilities already – who would like to do the whole thing at once. They would be able to say to others: look – you cannot do it, you are at fault. Our job is to bring all 15 Member States together so that the process of traceability throughout the whole of the food chain, from the birth of the animal to its slaughter and disposal, would be universally applied throughout the European Union. We say to those who are resistant to this: please remember that it is necessary to bring everybody on board. What everybody wants – whether they are farmers, citizens or consumers in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the Union – is to feel that they have equal confidence, wherever they are, in the safety of the product that they are consuming.</p>
<p class="contents">We have struck out the second subparagraph of Article 13(5) and all other amendments which follow the same line of allowing imprecise mixed origins or an indication such as "EU origin". One day "EU origin" may be assurance enough but it is not at this moment. We need to know from which state a product has arrived. I know that there are people in the Netherlands who disagree with that and I would be interested to know why. I cannot see that "EU origin" is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also opposed to the derogation for minced beef, which might apply to something like 30% of the beef output, which ought to be open to labelling. Minced beef is as much, if not more, at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources. It is the case in my country that we have seen minced beef and lamb and other meats mixed up together. We need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the rapporteur’s intention to stiffen and speed up the compliance provisions in Amendments Nos 42 and 43. We also agree that supplementary information should and can be provided for those Member States that need it and for those special regions which have important information to communicate.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is to end where I began. My country, Mr President, and yours – if I can call Scotland my country too, as I certainly would – have suffered the horrors of BSE. We know we bore a large part of the responsibility for it. It was incumbent upon us to make special provisions by way of food safety as a result. After our years of effort to that end, we can now justifiably say to the Community as a whole that what we want for ourselves we want for everyone else as well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, still more important to restore citizens’ confidence in the food they buy and eat – in actual fact, it is perhaps in that way that the market will be strengthened. The crucial factor is that it should be possible to trace with certainty the origins of what we eat. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 29 is very important for producers, above all perhaps for small producers in vulnerable areas. This Amendment would entitle producers to provide information on the label in addition to the name of the nation where the goods concerned originate. There would be the option to state, for example, the particular area from which the meat comes or the fact that a particular breed of cattle or special breeding methods have been used. However, there should be no legislation on this matter, other than a ban on lying. </p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased about Mr Whitehead’s remark about minced meat. I fully and wholeheartedly support Amendment No 30 from the rapporteur. For me, the most important aspect of this whole issue is that no exceptions should be made for cheap food. We who sit in this Chamber, for the most part middle-aged and well-to-do, know perfectly well that it is young people and families with children who buy and eat the cheapest food – sausages, hamburgers etc. In all social systems and at all periods in history, the most vulnerable groups have had the least purchasing power. It is our absolute moral duty first and foremost to make cheap food safe before we do the same for fillet of beef.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have approached the issue with the same consistency demonstrated by the European Parliament. Allow me to refresh your memory: compulsory registration has applied for a long time, because Regulation No 820/97 entered into force on 1 January 2000. The postponement adopted is not lawful. The European Parliament has filed charges against the Council because the postponement was not within the Council’s discretion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor did the Commission come up smelling of roses here. It was the Commission which proposed this seemingly elegant but legally dubious procedure. If nothing is done, compulsory labelling will enter into force on 1 September 2000. The Commission is therefore urged to accept the European Parliament’s proposals in this codecision process by 1 September. We have tried in our suit to ensure that no equally elegant attempt will be made to implement an extension on 1 September – and I hope that we shall succeed in putting a stop to this.</p>
<p class="contents">If we cannot agree on Parliament’s proposals by 1 September, then the old regulation with the compulsory system will enter into force. I therefore hope that you will implement Parliament’s reasonable proposals and that you will give up your plan to postpone this once again until the year 2003. It will confuse our citizens and will certainly meet with decisive resistance here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will be astounded to learn that, so many years after the start of the BSE crisis, the European Union still does not have a reliable traceability system for beef. Quite clearly, though, consumer confidence must be restored, as a matter of urgency, by guaranteeing the consumer perfect traceability from the stable to the table, so that any potential risk to human health can be efficiently eliminated at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the appropriate initiatives by the most enterprising Member States have compensated for the extraordinarily slow reactions of the Community apparatus. It is therefore all the more deplorable that they should have been deprived of this possibility by the Treaty of Amsterdam. I am thinking in particular of the compulsory labelling system which was drawn up in France together with livestock farmers and distributors, which has been in force since 1996. This system has proved very effective. It has made it possible to restore consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">France’s legitimate wish not to lift the embargo on British beef prematurely, since Britain did not offer the same guarantees of traceability, was in order to maintain this restored level of confidence. France had simply forgotten that it no longer had the right to do this. What a decidedly strange Europe it is that penalises Member States which take the necessary initiatives and action to restore consumer confidence and protect citizens’ health!</p>
<p class="contents">If legal action can now only be taken at Community level, then let us at least act quickly and stop indefinitely postponing the implementation of the commitments made in 1997 with a view to providing the consumer with transparent and comprehensible information.</p>
<p class="contents">Compulsory labelling indicating the origin of goods must therefore be introduced as soon as possible, and it must certainly not be postponed until 1 January 2003, as the Commission proposes. We must not agree to any exemptions, again as the Commission proposes, for minced and cut meat, which would be tantamount to excluding 30% to 50% of beef, according to the country, from the need for mandatory labelling. Nor must we agree, as the Commission is once again proposing, to adopt an over-general EC-type generic designation of origin. Consumers want to be certain of the operators’ ability to monitor the origin of meat accurately. The Member State of origin must therefore be indicated. Furthermore, beef imported from third countries must be subject to the same labelling regulations as Community beef, and if it does not comply with European Union regulations on traceability, this must also be clearly indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, is the intention of the amendments which Mrs Thomas-Moreau and I tabled on behalf of the UEN Group, which we are proposing to all our fellow Members who are keen to contribute to bringing about genuine traceability of beef.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This protection is undoubtedly belated in principle but, above all, illusory in practice. Firstly, in the draft regulation, 50% of European meat is effectively exempt from compulsory labelling if it is minced or cut. For the remaining 50%, labelling is not compulsory until 2003, which means that we have three years to dispose of British surplus stocks. And after 2003, the designation of origin may be limited to a simple indication of ‘EC origin’ with no mention of the country. What is more, to bury the prion under even more details, the label is laden down with indications of: the place where the animal was born, fattened, slaughtered and boned, with the Member State of origin, the region of origin, the farm of origin, a total of twelve items, plus the price and the weight, making a total of fourteen items, which is simply too much to read and take in.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Papayannakis is improving the system, the deadline for compulsory labelling has been brought forward from 2003 to 2001, since 2000 is out of the question; labelling is to be simplified, the national labelling systems mandatory in France, Belgium and Finland are to be retained. This is a good move. The amendments will be adopted. The unwillingness of the Commission is, however, with apologies to the Commissioner, apparent to everyone. As a solution, labelling is a good idea only at first sight. Labelling is no safeguard against GMOs, chocolate containing vegetable fats or, tomorrow, GMO fats, or, at a later date, American hormone-treated beef, or prion-infected meat.</p>
<p class="contents">The only effective protection would be checks, and this requires States and frontiers. We have, however, eliminated frontiers, and this is the price we have to pay for Europe: freedom of movement at the expense of safety. I just hope, ladies and gentlemen, that no one will have to be punished in future. Previously one could be punished at the stake, now punishment would mean a steak, a British beefsteak.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By means of this report and its conclusions, if they are adopted, we will be raising a number of concerns among consumers, in a very sensitive area where the mad cow syndrome is still predominant.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the EDD Group is concerned, product traceability provides a guarantee both for the protection of consumer health and for the promotion of quality products which all producers, large or small, are capable of producing if they favour quality over base commercial and financial interests which have little regard for human health. In our view the important and essential thing in this report is that all meat industry products should be covered by compulsory labelling, from basic butchered meat to derivatives, minced meat, cut meat, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the consumer must absolutely be provided with a complete set of information, with labelling which gives full details on the way the animal was reared and slaughtered: its place of birth, farming and slaughter, as well as feeding and farming techniques, not forgetting any antibiotics or growth promoters which may have been administered.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is essential that these measures should be implemented as quickly as possible, since it is a matter of consumer rights. Let us not delay, especially as this is no recent matter. It is high time we took action. Consumer confidence cannot be decreed, it must be earned.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, as I already stated in our discussions on 5 October 1999, the CPNT party members within the EDD Group will therefore support any measure in support of complete traceability, which can only be of benefit to everyone concerned: the consumer, who will be informed, and the good producer, who will be protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Other states have taken up this money to the tune of some £4m. – the Irish Republic to the tune of £100 000 – yet the disgraceful attitude of the London Government is to keep this from the UK farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I want also to say that the place of origin mentioned in any labelling system should be the real place of origin, because any idea of stating where meat is processed as the place of origin is not acceptable. That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass. Any food labelling policy must be accurate and dependable for both the producers and the consumers. Whatever may be the policy of this Union in regard to an open market economy, those people who want to buy home-produced meat should be given the right to know it is home-produced. Farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that, and so should the consumers.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report focuses on the traceability of beef, i.e. knowing its exact origins, but at the same time, this cannot be detached from consumer confidence, as consumers want information. </p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that this Parliament insists on also making national labelling possible and obligatory, while the Commission places the emphasis on labelling which states “originates from the EU”. I am convinced that one day, we will be proud again of a label which states: produced in the EU, and that we will have a food safety bureau in the European Union with a forceful, supranational mandate which can act promptly as and when problems arise. This must be our ultimate goal. We will then be where we need to be. Until such time, we need to be able to find out exactly what is happening, we need to be able to give the consumer sound information and until such time, we will need to use stop-gap measures to do this. One of these measures is most definitely the use of a label indicating the Member State. This is good, because in this way we can start restoring confidence in the producer, especially at a time when food safety is so much in the public eye. We simply need this. </p>
<p class="contents">Another positive step is if it could also be pointed out that there can be a time when confidence will be restored. In this sense, I have to say that my delegation and some in my group support Amendment No 61 tabled by Mr Maaten and Mr de Roo, in which the times are indicated when assurances can be given with regard to BSE inspections and other matters and which states that there can also be a time when the EU label will be applicable. I consider this to be an interim step, and ultimately I can see one key goal: to restore confidence, to produce a forceful EU label and ultimately a forceful food safety bureau, because these discussions are interconnected.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the most important consideration is that it does not just get us talking, but that we should also do something about it. The work of Mr Papayannakis has already been praised here. I would like to express my thanks too: it is a good basis for better standards of consumer safety throughout the European Union. We have plenty of examples of consumers not having always been given priority when it comes to food production.</p>
<p class="contents">The Single Market and the free movement of goods provide more freedom of choice for the public and better markets for producers. As the issue here is about food, it is even more important than ever to ensure that this freedom is also responsibly restricted, that consumers are protected, and that they have a right to know what they are eating. In this case, it is especially important that meat and processed meat products are among those products whose origin the consumer knows. Many have mentioned here that the EC label is not enough and that more precise information is needed. I agree with this. It is absolutely essential to know what country the products are from. In addition, the origin, not only of meat products, but of the ingredients used in processed meat, must be shown as clearly as possible. Labels must also be made compulsory as quickly as possible. The timetable that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is proposing is not too pressing.

Consumers require information about where the animal was born, bred and slaughtered, and cattle should be identified and registered so that their traceability can be guaranteed. The Commission must be far more vigorous than it has been so far in putting the screws on those countries which have not established databases, so ensuring that the countries concerned become fully operational in this respect. The issue is also one of credibility when it comes to implementing joint resolutions in all Member States. It is also about citizens’ confidence and belief that food quality is everything it should be. A bit of drive needs to be shown, and no exceptions should be made in the case of cattle which graze in the mountains. Where registration is required, what, in any case, is the difference between cattle which graze in the mountains and those which graze in valleys or in fields? I am in favour of beef being labelled with the name of the country or countries it comes from and I am strongly against introducing a common EU label from which consumers cannot see which countries are involved. The purpose of the regulation in question must be to achieve a situation in which consumers have confidence in meat from all EU countries. Until this is a reality, consumers need to know precisely which country their meat comes from. I have tabled an amendment to the effect that the slaughterhouse’s authorisation number should not be shown on the label. In this way, I wished to ensure that small and medium-sized slaughterhouses could continue to supply meat to butchers. The authorisation number does not provide the consumer with any useful information and has no bearing upon traceability.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compulsory registration system for bovine animals due to enter into force is the sine qua non for a reasonable beef labelling system. As a farmer, I am concerned that every consumer should be able to trace where his schnitzel has come from. All farmers are proud of the quality of their products and it is therefore in the farmers’ interests for everyone to know whom they have to thank for their extremely safe and healthy food.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a system must be practicable if it is to achieve its objective. We must take account of how the procedures will be applied in practice. Because of the varying topography of Europe, its farmers must apply different working and production methods. Take the example of summer pasturing in the Alps. As you know, every spring a total of 400 000 cattle are driven on to the Alps in Italy, Austria and Germany, where they remain for the summer, i.e. for about three months. Consideration must be given to the pasturing lists which are already in use and which take account of this situation in order to avoid forcing additional unnecessary administrative costs on farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have said, traceability must be guaranteed in all cases. But the regulation must be adapted to actual and local circumstances if it is to be seen as anything other than EU harassment, which merely triggers abuse and if it is to gain acceptance among the people. I therefore hope that proposed Amendment No 19 to Article 7(1) second indent will be adopted by the entire House. It has already been adopted by the Committee on the Environment and in the Committee on Agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important question is whether the “Origin: EU” label should be permitted as an added option. The Commission thinks it should. Many in Parliament believe that it is the country of origin that should be on the label. The background to this is the food crises. </p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more that beef should be completely traceable and that this should be the case as soon as possible. I also understand that consumers increasingly want information on the country of origin or region of origin concerning their food. This is often a matter of taste. Furthermore, I agree with the analysis that the “Origin: EU” label could be abused by countries where food safety is not regulated. But I do not advocate scrapping the option of including “Origin: EU” on the label either. In my opinion, we should choose another approach. We need to prescribe conditions for the use of the “Origin: EU” label. One condition, for example, could be that the identification and registration system must be fully implemented and observed. There are, of course, other means of enforcing compliance, but this method is far more direct. Parliament has to keep an eye on compliance with the directives it produces. This approach has the added advantage that the “Origin: EU” label has a positive ring to it. Rather than being a cover-up for countries where food quality needs to be regulated, the “Origin: EU” label is thus a quality guarantee. If the producer prefers to indicate the country of origin nonetheless, this is possible too. </p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of additional arguments as to why “Origin: EU” labelling should be possible. For example, the meat industry and retail trade have raised all kinds of practical objections and pointed at the red tape which too detailed information would entail. I will not spend any time on this argument, as it is not of key importance, in my opinion. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to ask your attention for a question of principle. The internal market is a large entity. The principle of mutual recognition is fundamental. Mutual recognition requires trust, and trust requires common standards, especially in the case of food safety. If we prohibit the use of the “Origin: EU” label, we would be resigning ourselves to a kind of re-nationalisation of the internal market. We would then be accepting that we have more confidence in certain countries than others and this is a sign of little faith in our own food safety policy. This is unacceptable in my view. All EU Member States need to guarantee safe meat. “Origin: EU” is then a symbol for quality and I therefore advocate backing Amendments Nos 60 and 61.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must put our own house, our own part of the world, in order. The EU is expanding eastward, and we all know the capacity and volume of meat and beef production there, for example. This should also alert them to the fact that they must now start to put their own affairs in order, so that they can adapt to the model that exists here. If we are not ready, how can we expect others to be? For this reason, labelling must be kept very simple: the labels must show the country of origin, and, if one wishes, the region of production. But a label showing the country of origin of a product is very important to us, particularly if we want consumers to have confidence in food safety in the future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, this transparency is applicable, within the beef industry, to two different but indissociable areas: BSE and labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">France is stepping up its precautionary measures for specified at-risk materials and is implementing an extensive protocol to evaluate ESB tests on bovine animals. Tomorrow, the European Union is preparing to outline a test programme for all Member States. In this context, consumers would not understand the delays in the matter of labelling. I am therefore particularly concerned to ensure that the operators in this industry are not confronted with a legal vacuum which would lead public opinion, quite legitimately, to wonder whether there is a real desire for greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">How else is it possible to explain the fact that at European level we have managed to obtain an agreement on chocolate but that we are unable to meet the deadlines we set ourselves in an area as sensitive and important as beef.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make no mistake as to what is at issue here. I am convinced that the subject of beef labelling is no mere technical issue. I should like to point out that if labelling is of such great importance to consumers it is because it is their guarantee that product traceability has been tightened up, that the operators in the industry and also the European and national public authorities have become more accountable, and that control systems have been improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what our fellow citizens are demanding is the right to information. This right to be informed is the natural counterpart to the development of trade and the proper exercise of competition. By virtue of the transparency it conveys, labelling makes it possible to improve the freedom of movement of beef, providing assurances to consumers and guaranteeing their freedom to make an informed choice. In the beef sector, improving consumer information through labelling represents a strong message from Europe to its trading partners: it demonstrates its intention, over and above product health safety, to safeguard the consumer’s freedom of choice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, integral chain control (ICC) is already well-known in many countries. In my opinion, this is not related to national borders. If certain conditions are met – and I would like to refer to Amendments Nos 60 and 61 concerning the inspection of BSE, as others have done so before me – then the designation “Origin: EU” is sufficient as far as I am concerned. This does not preclude all the other information being added to the label on a voluntary basis. Mentioning the relevant country, region, town, village, and so on and so forth, is fine but let the consumer decide where he wants to buy the product. But it should not be an EU stipulation. If this were to be the case, then this would be a re-nationalisation of Europe’s common market in a sense, and that would be a retrograde step.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am also concerned about some of the words that might go on the label. One of those words is "slaughtered".

A European Union-wide identification system for cattle is long overdue. The system is certainly very necessary, if nothing else than to achieve a level playing field within the European Union and to ensure that all countries reach the same standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to sound a note of caution. I come from an area in Northern Ireland that has a standard of identification and traceability which is as good as any ever will be. No system is a hundred per cent perfect, so do not think you can bring that about. There will always be people out to abuse the system. That has been the case for centuries – and will continue. You can only try to develop the best possible system of traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a number of concerns. The first is: who pays? The problem to date has been, in my experience in Northern Ireland, that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability, and this has been substantial. It has not been borne by the retailer. The consumer will perhaps ultimately pay – but he or she may not. From that point of view it is expensive for those people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one further question of the Commission. Is it wise to renationalise the beef market? Or even to regionalise it within countries. I seriously question that point. We have fought for years within the European Union to achieve a single market and now we are renationalising that market. I challenge the Commission tonight to answer that question. Is this a wise move? Let us not look to the short term, let us look to the long term, because the long term is the challenge – not five years but ten, fifteen years from now. What is going to be the situation on the beef market?</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, in Northern Ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations. I have to say to the Commission, and to producers in other Member States, that my producers have to date not seen any financial benefit from that which they have suffered.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First to ensure the traceability of beef, second to allow consumers to make a fully informed choice. Unfortunately, although the two aims are compatible, there is some tension between them where the details of the regulation are concerned. This is particularly the case in relation to Article 13 and Article 13(2) primarily serving the first and Article 13(5) the second aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 26 and 28 to 13(5) therefore seemed rather confused – one seeking less and one seeking more detailed information for consumers. For this reason, whatever the final form of Article 13, I regard Amendments Nos 15 and 29 as being of the first importance. Amendment 29 in particular will allow areas of the EU that are justifiably proud of the quality of their product to identify it as such. For my own constituency of course, Aberdeen Angus beef is already justly renowned throughout the world but I am sure the same is true for other regions in the rest of the UK and other Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A whole series of amendments to the Commission proposal have been tabled, 44 of which were accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on 22 March. A further 18 proposed amendments were subsequently submitted for this plenary sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start with the Commission’s views on the first 44 proposals. The Commission is able to accept 18 of them. This includes proposed amendments which are accepted in full or in part and amendments which require minor editorial changes. In another 12 proposed amendments I can see what your concerns are but the Commission is unable to accept these amendments. However, I shall ensure that the Council is informed of your point of view. This applies, for example, to proposed Amendment No 20.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the proposed amendments which the Commission is able to accept, such as Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 18 and 19 first part, and 21, 33, 35 and 42 tighten up the wording. I also accept proposed Amendment No 19, second part, which makes provision for a simplification for cattle pastured on the Alps in the summer. The improvements to the definition of labelling are also acceptable. The same applies to the information to be included on the label and to the interpretation of the concept of origin. I am therefore prepared to accept proposed Amendments Nos 22 and 23, insofar as they concern labelling, and the parts of proposed Amendments Nos 25, 26 and 28 calling for information on individual regions to be scrapped.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all concerned that the labelling system should be introduced as quickly as possible, I welcome proposed Amendment No 39 reducing the deadline set for the Member States to appoint the competent authorities. Finally, proposed Amendment No 44, under which the regulation would enter into force on 1 September 2000 heads in exactly the same direction. I think the new recital suggested in proposed Amendment No 6, whereby Member States must ensure that their databases are operational as quickly as possible, is also a good idea. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also able to accept the parts of proposed Amendments Nos 25, 26 and 28 making information on the region optional, whereby I assume, if no decision is made to the contrary, that this information will come under the voluntary system. As I too take the view that the possibility of confusion with protected geographical indications governed by Regulation 2081/92 must be excluded, I agree unreservedly with the new recital in proposed Amendment No 15. Nonetheless, we must still investigate how the stated objective is to be reached, whereby I envisage a more comprehensive solution than that suggested in proposed Amendment No 29.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of when compulsory indications of origin need to be introduced is an important point. As the obligation to enter the place of birth and all stopovers in the animal passport and database has only been introduced for animals born on or after 1 January 1998, it will be difficult to trace the complete origin of bovine animals over the next five years. According to our calculations, this problem will apply to just under half the beef produced from 2003 onwards, which is why I have reservations about introducing compulsory indications of origin earlier or even, as suggested in proposed Amendment No 26, as early as 1 September 2001. I would point out in this respect that the Committee on Agriculture has recommended that they be introduced on 1 January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that you insist that indications of origin must state the country, even if this means listing several countries on the label. I am sorry that you find the simplified indication “Produced in the European Union” unacceptable, despite the fact that it is in keeping with the principles of the internal market. As far as labelling of minced meat is concerned, we must bear in mind that the production of minced meat, for example of hamburgers, is a continuous process. The obligation to provide a complete indication of origin for this meat would therefore give rise to technical problems and may well bring the entire intra-Community trade in processed meat to a virtual standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore suggest that you reconsider the simplified labelling system. The proposed labelling regulation makes provision for the possibility of combining animals in groups rather than entering each individual animal with producers who take the trouble to guarantee the traceability of each individual animal given an incentive in the form of a special logo.</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that I do not fully understand why you demand in proposed Amendments Nos 14 and 31 that we should let go of the only instrument which guarantees real and complete traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission’s powers to react to unusual and unforeseen circumstances are concerned, I am, unfortunately, unable to accept proposed Amendments Nos 16 and 38 because they prevent a practicable solution. Finally, I think it is premature to commit ourselves to extending the labelling system to processed products containing beef, as suggested in proposed Amendment No 40. Let us gain some experience with the system being proposed now and then we can consider this idea at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposed amendments tabled subsequently at the end of last week are concerned, I have already explained in connection with proposed Amendments Nos 45 and 46 that the Commission agrees with you that the first stage of the compulsory system should start on 1 September this year. If proposed Amendment No 44 is accepted, the regulation automatically enters into force on this date. Proposed Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are therefore superfluous for technical reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as proposed Amendment No 47 is concerned, I should like to advise against continuing the national compulsory beef identification system as soon as the full EU system has been introduced. In the end we would have 15 different national systems, which runs completely counter to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposed Amendment No 48 refers to information on the use of antibiotics or stimulants and to fattening methods. This idea may look simple on paper, but it is in fact extremely complicated to administer and, more importantly, to control. In addition, there is no definition of the various rearing methods and every animal will certainly be fed using various methods, rather than one and the same method, during its lifetime. As far as medication is concerned, it would be much better to maintain our high veterinary standards, thereby guaranteeing that only safe beef reaches the market. The Commission would therefore prefer not to adopt this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the voluntary system is concerned, which is to be set up alongside the new compulsory system in order to include all the information which is not being made compulsory, the Commission can accept two of the four amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, namely proposals 33 and 35.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious from the vote in committee that Parliament is not in favour of amending the Commission’s basic attempt to simplify the approval procedure. However, I see that a total of nine new proposed amendments have been tabled for this plenary sitting which were not adopted by the Committee on the Environment. These amendments seek to re-introduce a formal approval procedure for voluntary information on labels.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me assure you that such amendments do not cause any particular problem because their purpose is to reinforce the administrative procedure. For the rest, recent discussions in the Council have gone in the same direction. I am therefore convinced that these proposed amendments will be taken on board by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, the Commission will be acting as go-between between the two decision-making institutions on this matter. With just over three months, we do not have much time left for a final decision. Given the speed with which you have worked here in Parliament, hopefully the Council will decide on its common position as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
