<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, HIV, malaria and tuberculosis claim millions of lives each year. At least five million people died in the world’s poor countries during last year alone. These three diseases are different by nature, and different types of effort are required to prevent them and cure people of them. They have one thing in common, however. They first and foremost affect the poor people of the world. It is therefore logical to coordinate aid when it comes to combating them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament have for many years demanded that the Commission should increase its efforts in the health sphere. When, at the end of 2000, the Commission put forward a plan consisting of measures to step up the fight against these diseases, it was therefore a welcome decision. Commissioner Nielson deserves recognition for having made the fight against these diseases a priority within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are discussing here today is extraordinarily important. It provides the framework for the way in which the programme of measures is to be implemented. An important aspect is the Commission’s own programme. It is important for adequate resources in terms of personnel to be set aside so that the programme is effective. The other aspect is the EU’s contribution to the Global Health Fund which has recently been set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Large parts of the Commission’s proposal for a regulation are constructive. During the reading in committee, we tried to strengthen the wording in a number of areas and tried to give more weight to the whole issue by increasing the level of the budget. We have conducted parallel discussions with the Council in an attempt to reach unanimity at first reading, an objective I hope will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">What is noted first of all in those areas in which we propose stronger wording is the importance both of efforts at prevention and of efforts to give support and care to those who have been infected by HIV or who have fallen ill with AIDS. Vigorous endeavours to prevent these diseases cannot take place in a vacuum. That is why, secondly, it is so important, parallel with these efforts, purely and simply to strengthen the health systems in the poor countries. Thirdly: even if this regulation does not specifically support research, it emphasises the importance of investing significantly more money in research to produce vaccines against HIV and malaria and more effective medicines. Coordination with other donors is emphasised. The same naturally applies to coordination with those working in the area of reproductive health and family planning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, we stress how important it is for countries that have been hit hard by these diseases to be able to import cheap and generic medicines. It is sad to see that this issue has still not been resolved in spite of long and intensive negotiations within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the budget appropriation to be inadequate, given the needs that exist. Calculations have shown that ten billion dollars a year would be required in order effectively to combat these three diseases. At present, just a couple of billion dollars are being invested.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s investment has so far been small, but a number of positive things have nonetheless happened during the discussion of this matter, for example last autumn’s budget agreement concerning the contributions to the Global Fund. At the same time, it is clear that the EU’s endeavours to combat these diseases must not of course be directed primarily by what is required to obtain a place on the Global Fund’s board. What counts, of course, is what is needed for doing the actual work on combating disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget that we in the committee are now proposing is also too small, but we nonetheless see the fact that we have succeeded in increasing the budget level as a step forwards. This hopefully means that, together with the contributions from the EDF, slightly more than EUR 500 million will be invested in this area in the period of the next four years.</p>
<p class="contents">During the vote, I shall table an additional proposal that is necessary if our decision is to be in accordance with the new rules governing the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we must soon discuss further contributions to this work, and mainly the issue of ‘fresh’ new money. I myself was recently in Kenya and saw how badly just one poor country had been hit by these problems. When as many as 20 to 30% of a country’s people are infected, the consequences are disastrous. Mind you, it is not only Africa that has been affected. Rather, we are now seeing a rapid spread of disease in countries such as India and China too.</p>
<p class="contents">These three diseases will constitute a serious problem for a long time to come. When the new head of the Global Fund, Richard Feachem, was here recently, he stated that the HIV epidemic would not reach its peak for another 60 years if far greater preventive efforts were not made. Sixty years is a long time. After just 20 years, more than 40 million people have now already been affected. The imagination is barely capable of understanding the consequences of another 60 years of a galloping HIV epidemic. Those are reasons enough for strongly supporting today’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, who has worked tirelessly to secure adoption at first reading and has also exercised great skill in tackling the substance of this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal for a regulation on poverty diseases was adopted last March. The Commission places high priority on health questions and development, and has presented a programme of action to counter HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. I think we are agreed on the importance of improving health in developing countries. As regards the regulation, we have had lengthy and constructive debates on issues including inter alia the TRIPs Agreement but it is the financial issues, which have proved most difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just remind you that the reality of budget support linked to results in health matters, and indeed education, logically forms the missing link in these discussions. As we move on and improve on indicators, I feel confident that we will build up a more robust consensus between Parliament and the Commission when it comes to demonstrating what we are in fact doing in these areas, even if the method of doing it cannot simply be described by referring to budget lines as such. The situation is improving and I just wanted to reiterate this point in the ongoing discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept all the amendments voted by the Development Committee, as they strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation without altering the main objectives. There are also some up-dates made to references in the Commission's original proposal which we are happy to accept. These amendments reflect constructive collaboration between the Council and Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has now submitted an amendment presenting a proposal for EUR 351 million for the years 2003 to 2006. I am of course sympathetic to the proposal to increase the funding but I must tell you that we have not been able to find the necessary resources within the Community budget. If this point has to some extent been a casualty of any shortcoming in communication between the rapporteur and my services, then I regret that, but I must make it clear that a sum of that magnitude is not within the lines of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, have agreed substantial increases for this budget line in 2003 compared to the 2002 budget line for HIV/AIDS. During the December Plenary Session, an amendment was adopted which increased the 2003 budget allocation to EUR 80.35 million. A financial declaration agreed by the three institutions specifies that EUR 42 million is to go to the global fund and the remaining EUR 38.35 million to the programme for action. The Commission continues to see health issues as a priority and is determined wherever possible to find resources to improve health, whether through health sector programmes or budget support linked to improved health indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also propose a further substantial contribution from the EDF for the global fund against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are one or two amendments that cause some difficulties. As the rapporteur stated, Article 28 of the new financial regulation requires that any proposal submitted that has budgetary impact must be accompanied by a financial statement and an evaluation. This report does not do so with respect to the new figure of EUR 351 million, so my committee will only be in a position to support this report if the rapporteur tables an oral amendment to this effect. I hope that all the groups in this House will support this approach because objecting to the oral amendment will only lead to referral back and delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to this figure, we have to recognise the constraints in the financial perspective that we have at the moment. Unless we use the flexibility instrument, it will be very difficult for us to meet the amounts stated. So it will have an impact on other policy areas within heading 4 and my plea to all parties is that, when we move on to this stage, this should not be done at the expense of other policies affecting the poorest countries. We do not want to give with one hand and take away with the other. This is precisely what the Development Council states: any funding should be additional.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I welcome whole-heartedly the contents of the Commission paper and the rapporteur's proposals, and I applaud the fact that the EU has led the way in this area. HIV, tuberculosis and malaria are the world's greatest killers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today. Nearly six million people have died. So much EU funding is used for intangible issues, and I hope we will support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people in the South are still dying of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, but our words speak louder than our actions. These people also suffer from dengue, trypanosomoses and other filariases, but I am sad to say that nothing is being done to combat these diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all I deplore the informal procedure which has prevailed until today’s debate. Having been subjected to strong pressure from the Commission and the Council to adopt this regulation at first reading, so as to allow the programme to come into force quickly, we have actually suffered real blackmail at the hands of these institutions, which are determined to weaken this report and to undermine our powers of codecision. We were surprised at their reluctance to accept a precise reference to the declaration on public health and intellectual property adopted at Doha, and the rights that it gives developing countries with regard to access to medicines. What happened to those European declarations emphasising health before profits?</p>
<p class="contents">On many occasions, the European Parliament has reaffirmed that access to treatments at cost price is inseparable from prevention, from the strengthening of health systems and structures, particularly the public services, and from research and development. The Commission had seemed to be receptive to Parliament’s arguments as long as they were not binding. Faced with this legislative regulation, however, its attitude changed. Thus in Geneva last December, in the context of the negotiations at the TRIPS Council, the Member States and the Commission could hardly be said to have been inspired by the European Parliament’s resolutions on access to medicines. The European Union’s preferred solution for countries which, not having any production capacity of their own, have to import medicines under compulsory licence from other countries was totally unworkable for developing countries. By an ironic twist of fate, this bad agreement was rejected by the United States, which wanted to reduce its scope even further. The general budget for the programme has also been revised downwards: EUR 350 million for a five-year programme is very little when we consider what is at stake, and it is much less than the EUR 500 million originally requested.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would say that we should adopt this regulation as a matter of urgency, but not at the price of democracy. We Members of the European Parliament are here not to promote our own selfish interests, but to promote the interests of the citizens of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have called this report 'Diseases on poor countries' and we have focused on Africa, where 28 million people are HIV positive, and on the potential increase in these dreadful diseases in India and China, as well as TB and hepatitis B. But these are no longer diseases of poor countries because of our global inter-dependence and the fact that, for example in the United Kingdom alone, 115 000 settlers are now coming and living in our country and we are allowing 100 000 asylum seekers to come into our country. HIV rates have increased by 100% in the United Kingdom in the last year to 5 000 cases. TB has increased by 200% to 7 300 reported cases. The London Borough of Brent now has a higher rate of TB than China and twice that of Brazil. 26 300 hepatitis B infections were reported in the last four years in London alone. One person in 50 in east London has hepatitis B – the same level as in Nepal. So why the reference to poor countries?</p>
<p class="contents">No: this is a global epidemic where we are inter-dependent, and what we do to help the people in the developing countries to eradicate and stop these diseases is also going to have an enormous impact on how we and our children are going to live in Europe. I think we need to establish the connection between development and what happens in our own countries, and I now want to ask the Labour Government to act on this before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should enable us, at last, to launch the European Union’s action plan on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the countries of the South. This is a matter of urgency, because these diseases continue to kill millions of people every year, essentially in the developing countries, and, as we know, the diseases are in the South and the medicines are in the North.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of Mr Wijkman’s report, we have to decide on two fundamental public health issues in the countries of the South. First of all, there is the issue of the financial resources which the European Union will be devoting to the fight against these three diseases in the coming years. On this point, the adoption of this regulation is an important step forward, but I should like to think that it is only the first step, because in June 2001, at the United Nations, the international community undertook to achieve, by 2005, the objective of seven to ten billion US dollars of annual expenditure exclusively to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries. We are therefore a long way from our goal, and if Europe wants to fulfil its obligations, it will have to go beyond the EUR 351 million over four years, which is what the rapporteur is proposing and what we are proposing together with him.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue at stake in this regulation is the political support expressed by the European Union for the countries of the South in their struggle to promote public health. On this point, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has done a good job. From now on, this regulation will contain an explicit and unequivocal reference to the Doha declaration on intellectual property, which recognises the specific rights of the countries of the South. It will also contain a reference to the facilitation of access to medicines in developing countries by making those medicines available at the lowest possible prices. However, this political support from the European Union should, above all, be expressed and manifested to the WTO in no uncertain terms. In this respect I deplore the failure of the negotiations of last December on the clarification of Article 31 of the intellectual property agreements. In order to escape from this impasse, the European Union must unreservedly support the proposals of the countries of the South. That is the request, Commissioner, which I am asking you to pass on to Commissioner Lamy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty-related diseases are a serious threat to the development of poor countries, and we have the important task of helping these countries fight these diseases. The World Fund, for example, is a very useful tool for tackling the combating of disease on a global level, and at the moment it is being suggested that the EU contribute EUR 35 million to it. There are calls to increase this amount. Despite the useful work they do, I myself do not endorse this directly. I think that it is very important to first take a look at what happens to the contribution. We must have the guarantee that the money will be spent properly and efficiently. Transparency plays a major role in this. I therefore wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur’s proposal to include the actions financed from the World Fund in the Commission’s annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself also believe that the pharmaceutical industry has an important role to play. Not only must they offer affordable prices, they must also be willing to share their know-how with partners in developing countries. A win-win situation. By producing products locally, they will be contributing directly to combating poverty, increasing knowledge and fighting disease more efficiently, as the products will already be with the potential customers. So there will be fewer logistical problems, and the TRIPs do not have to be an obstacle to this, given the Doha Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to ensure that we can combat poverty effectively, I would also argue for more attention to be paid to informing the population. It is extremely important that patients realise that once a course of treatment has begun it must be finished. How often do you hear the complaint that a patient with malaria has contracted a resistant variant because he stopped his course of treatment too soon out of ignorance. We must pay the necessary attention to this as well. Information and education must be spearheads in our development policy, also in relation to combating poverty-related diseases. The pharmaceutical industry can make a formidable contribution to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are of course all aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation. Five million people die each year of one of these three diseases. Almost 40 million people are infected by AIDS/HIV, and 90% of them live in developing countries, most of those – 70% – in sub-Saharan Africa. We are also seeing tuberculosis making a comeback. As for malaria, which reappeared in the seventies, it is once again affecting countries in which it had been eradicated. There is no need to say any more, except that the European Union owes it to itself to adopt, quickly, a strategy to combat these diseases effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation that we are discussing here defines the framework for Community action. It also creates the legal basis for Europe’s contribution, the aim being to encourage research to develop medicines, treatments and vaccines and to facilitate access to them. This is absolutely vital, because only 10% of research activities concern diseases which are responsible for 90% of disease in the world. We therefore need to carry out public research and encourage the private sector to invest in it. We must also, above all, ensure that these medicines are suitable for the living conditions that prevail in the countries concerned, so that they can be distributed via health systems which are worthy of the name. Finally, we must ensure that the prices are not prohibitive, and here we come back to the problem of intellectual property.</p>

This is further confirmation of the need to speed up the adoption, which seems to be possible at first reading already, of this proposal for a regulation so that it can be swiftly implemented, in line with the European Union’s responsibilities to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is certainly a substantial contribution – albeit not to a large enough degree – to the recently constituted Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, a fund strongly called for by the Italian Prime Minister too during the G8 Summit in Genoa and – I would add – which was made available in record time compared with the time which these things usually take. I am afraid, however, that the situation is still alarming and there is no time to lose: we still can and must do much more.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not tire of repeating, once again, that we need a coordinated approach between policies on development cooperation, research and health in the fight against these diseases, including through developing third countries’ health systems. Everyone is aware of the facts, and among these I would highlight this one: each day, between 12 and 14 thousand people contract the AIDS virus throughout the world. As Mr Deva rightly said, this is a disease which has now also arrived on our doorstep: just think of the thousands of children in Romania who have contracted this virus. Therefore, although this is a global problem, it nevertheless affects developing countries in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">So while the budget represents the main obstacle to the adoption of this proposal for a regulation as amended, I would like briefly to consider a key element: the issue of drugs, their cost and access to treatment and medicines. How can it be that, even now, only 10% of both public and private research is dedicated to studying these diseases which are responsible for a good 90% of disease in developing populations? I wonder what became of my request, which I submitted along with Mr Tajani more than two years ago, which called in this very forum for the urgent drafting of a common plan, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical manufacturers, that focused more on combating poverty diseases. Given the scale and cross-border nature of the phenomenon – now on our doorstep – these poverty diseases call for a systematic response from the whole international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The World Population Report for 2002, which has just appeared, contains some shocking figures. On average, 14 000 men, women and children die of this scourge every day. It is now the commonest cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. To date, more than 60 million people worldwide have become infected and around 22 million of them have died. Of the 40 million persons infected, 95% live in developing countries and nearly three quarters of them in Africa. Out of 580 000 children below the age of 15 who have died from AIDS, 500 000 – almost 90% – lived in Africa. I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">This catalogue of disasters is not only the sum of millions of human tragedies, however, but it is something that affects whole societies. Life expectancy is falling, education is severely affected, agricultural output is declining, and the social and economic fabric is being eroded. Plans for fighting HIV/AIDS must not be confined to the health aspects. What is needed is an integral strategy with wide-ranging education and prevention campaigns. Those who are already infected are entitled to the best possible treatment. We carry some responsibility for that. It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge, awareness and, of course, the necessary resources for prevention and treatment. Because once a person is infected, that cannot be reversed. In Sierra Leone I saw large posters on streets and squares with the blunt message: <span class="italic">Aids kills!</span> malaria and tuberculosis can be cured, AIDS cannot. AIDS can be avoided, however, and that is worth every effort.</p>

The proposals that have been put forward fall far short of what the problem requires.

They need to be more serious when they promise that the European Union’s contribution to the world fund to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria will come from additional resources, while we can see today that this money comes from existing budget lines, and they need to be more consistent when they confirm, in this House, the importance of public health services for the developing countries, while in the negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services they claim that the liberalisation and privatisation of services will be a good thing for those same countries. They also need to be more consistent by ensuring that this proposed regulation also provides for the supply of medicines at affordable prices. Remember that the WTO negotiations have still not enabled us to achieve this result in the case of those countries which do not have the capacity to produce medicines themselves. We might well, therefore, ask ourselves sometimes whether the Commissioners ever talk to one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I maintain that what we have achieved in this field of communicable diseases represents a good illustration of the Commission working across the different areas of responsibility. This initiative would never have been launched and achieved its results without that work attitude. As to the issue of further research into these diseases, this is also reflected in what my colleague Mr Busquin is doing, and the Sixth Framework Programme for European Research places greater emphasis on this research in order to accelerate it. I agree that the pharmaceutical companies are not doing enough in this area from the point of view of global poverty. It is interesting to note that the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation has recently announced the availability of 200 million US dollars by way of a competition fund to prompt pharmaceutical companies to attract that money for accelerated research into malaria, TB and AIDS, but mainly malaria. We will work with them and are of course already in contact with them, as this makes sense. I would once again point out that when, as in this instance, Parliament is trying to raise additional funds for these activities, this is of course a welcome development.<span class="bold"> </span>As a Commissioner, I have to tell you that the Commission does not print money. We have to work within the constraints of the budget and the perspective as defined by the budgetary authority as a whole. So I repeat: we cannot accept the amendment regarding the EUR 351 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
