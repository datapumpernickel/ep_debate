<p class="contents">Question No 33 by <span class="bold">Karin Riis‐Jørgensen </span>(H−0388/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: German taxes on Danish coach companies</p>
<p class="contents">Danish coach operators are experiencing major problems in securing approval for their fare scales when transporting tourists in Germany and are therefore required to pay VAT according to the higher German market price.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Danish coach companies are having to pay an unjustifiably high level of VAT. In practice, it is an unreasonable burden on coach companies in Denmark to require them to ascertain how they are to calculate their price per kilometre since, for example, the tax office in Flensburg concludes individual agreements with coach operators, refuses to approve operating accounts approved by Danish state‐authorised auditors and often changes practice as far as the basis of calculation and administrative procedures are concerned. As a result, Germany has been holding back sums due to Danish operators, in one case for up to one and a half years, without paying interest on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council take the view that the above situation is in conformity with the rules of the internal market? If so, will it explain why in detail?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">I must inform Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen that the Council has not yet had any cause to deal with the problem she raises in her question.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to point out that this is a problem relating to the smooth functioning of the internal market. Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen also assumes this in her question. It would therefore primarily be the responsibility of the Commission to check compliance with current rules and if necessary to take the appropriate measures. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 34 by <span class="bold">Heidi Hautala </span>(H−0392/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Democratic control over the interception of telecommunications</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters contains some particularly sensitive provisions with regard to the interception of telecommunications. It is technically feasible to listen to a subject who is in a different country from the listening authority. Differing views prevail in the Member States firstly as to whether this should be permitted, and secondly as to whether a licence from the target country is required or if a notification to this effect is sufficient. In Finland there has been public concern about the interception of telecommunications, because all the preparatory documents concerning police cooperation and this Convention are secret. Can the Council guarantee the democratic control of the interception of telecommunications and the legal protection of the subjects of such interception? Does the Council intend to define the offences it regards as justifying the interception of telecommunications? How does the Council propose to guarantee that such interception will remain, in practice as well as in theory, the exclusive preserve of the competent authorities of the subject's own country? Does the Council propose to publish a summary of the differences between the EU Member States' provisions governing the interception of telecommunications? How does the Council propose to consult Parliament on the draft Convention pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty of Amsterdam (former Art. K.11)?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is to complete the European Convention of 20 April 1959 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. The Council is examining in particular the inclusion of rules on the interception of telecommunications for the purpose of criminal investigations in EU Member States. Agreement on provisions in this area is not only in the interests of effectively combating serious crime but is particularly urgently needed to guarantee the legitimacy of cross‐border interception measures: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Requests for telephone interception have hitherto been approved on the basis of the 1959 Convention, although this does not contain any specific rules concerning the interception of telecommunications. For the new satellite telecommunications systems there are no provisions whatsoever concerning interception. What makes such situations unusual is that for interception purposes a link‐up may be required in a ground station in one Member State while the interception subject is in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement between the Member States that where the Member State on whose territory the interception subject is located is, for specific technical reasons, not required to provide technical assistance for the interception, that Member State must nevertheless be involved by the Member State carrying out the interception. Such involvement is needed so that the Member State concerned can ensure that the interception of a person on its territory is in line with its domestic laws, and in particular with fundamental rights. The details of a regulation to this effect are currently being examined by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ The draft does not contain a definition of the criminal offences that justify the issuing of an interception order, as it deals exclusively with relations between the Member States in cross‐border matters. The Council agrees, however, that the interception of telecommunications is to be judged in particular in relation to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ There are no plans to limit interception measures to the authorities in the subject"s own country, nor would this be appropriate in view of the particular nature of the new, modern satellite telecommunications described earlier. This would mean that a criminal who uses modern satellite telephones could not be intercepted, in contrast to a criminal who uses a standard telephone. The planned rules will guarantee that satellite telecommunications can also be intercepted.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ National provisions on the interception of telecommunications in the Member States have been examined in the context of the European judicial network. An appropriate form of publication is being considered for the results. In view of the different national regulations the Council will examine in accordance with Article 131 of the Treaty of Amsterdam whether it will be necessary to bring Member States" provisions into line with each other in order to improve cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ The European Parliament was consulted on the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters under the UK Presidency. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam the Council will consult the European Parliament once again in accordance with the new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 35 by <span class="bold">Bernie Malone </span>(H−0393/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Mistreatment of an EU citizen in Bahrain</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the case of Mr Eamonn Caffrey, an Irish national, who was detained in Bahrain from 26 July 1998 on charges of embezzlement and released from custody and without conviction on 9 September 1998?</p>
<p class="contents">During his detention, Mr Caffrey was held for long periods without food or water and was made aware of torture taking place elsewhere in the prison. Is the Council also aware of the allegations made by Mr Caffrey against DHL, for whom he worked, i.e. that they tried to keep him in custody for as long as possible, that they did not inform the British or Irish embassies of his 44 day detention and that a representative of DHL informed Mr Caffrey's relatives and friends that he was being well looked after, when, in fact, he was not?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The consular care of EU citizens does not fall within the remit of the Council, but is governed by bilateral agreements. The presidency is therefore unable to express an opinion on this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 36 by <span class="bold">Anna Terrón i Cusí </span>(H−0395/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Remit of the High Level Group on immigration and asylum</p>
<p class="contents">In January 1998, the Council – without consulting Parliament – adopted an action plan on the influx of immigrants from Iraq and neighbouring countries. In view of its pioneering nature as a pilot programme and, therefore, a point of reference for future action plans, Parliament adopted a report on the subject on 22 March 1999, in which it requested information about the implementation of the plan. As yet, this information has not been forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">At the next summit in Tampere, the High Level Group will be submitting a final report to the Council for its approval, containing various action plans for some of the main third countries of origin and transit of immigrants and asylum‐seekers. Does the Council intend to consult Parliament in advance on this occasion?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Council"s acceptance of the mandate on 25 January 1999, the presidency informed the European Parliament of the role and activities of the newly formed High Level Group on immigration and asylum in a letter from Foreign Minister Fischer to President Gil Robles on 26 February 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member rightly points out, the results of the Group"s work will be presented to the European Council in Tampere in October. This means that the Group is working under considerable pressure of time and must conclude its work by September at the latest. The presidency can therefore only keep Parliament informed of the progress of the Group. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 37 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−0397/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Kashmir</p>
<p class="contents">What steps is the Council going to take to ensure compliance with UN resolutions on a referendum on Kashmir? Why does the Council believe that military action is needed in Kosovo and Serbia to stop human rights abuses but appears to be taking no steps to prevent and stop human rights abuses in Kashmir?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency shares the view of the honourable Member that the conflict in Kashmir is the most intractable problem besetting relations between India and Pakistan. In the interests of the people of Kashmir it is urgently necessary to find a solution to this problem; such a solution is, however, only possible through a dialogue between the two countries. Outside intervention is therefore out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">The prime ministers of India and Pakistan met in Lahore in February this year and agreed, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> , that all outstanding disputes, including the Kashmir question, should be solved through dialogue and that the Simla agreement should be implemented. The results of the meeting in Lahore were welcomed by the European Union, which now urges both parties to implement the Lahore agreement as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 38 by <span class="bold">Richard Howitt </span>(H−0399/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Millennium Round</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council tell Parliament which Member States have initiated, supported, or spoken in opposition to the European Union's proposal for a new and comprehensive Millennium Round of negotiations in the World Trade Organisation and on which occasions they have done so? How does the Council expect to consult the European Parliament on this question?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">All WTO member states are contractually committed to hold further negotiations in the WTO from 1999/2000 in important areas (including the agricultural and services sectors). The EU Member States and the Commission agreed some time ago that it was in the interests of the EU to conduct negotiations about these sectors together with other matters of interest in a comprehensive WTO round. The Commission and the EU Member States coordinate the EU's WTO policy in committee 113.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC Treaty makes no provision for official consultation of the European Parliament by the Council in this field. However, the Council sets great store by the fact that the Commission as the negotiating body should report to the European Parliament comprehensively and in good time about the forthcoming EU negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 39 by <span class="bold">Ursula Stenzel </span>(H−0400/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Resignation of the Commission</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has recently proved that, as the sole Community body with direct legitimacy, it is willing and able to carry out the control functions demanded by its citizens. The obligation on the Commission to resign as a body (and only as a body) following a vote of no confidence no longer seems appropriate. In its resolution (B4‐0327, 0329, 0330, 0331, 0332 and 0333/99) the European Parliament calls on the Council to lay down, at the earliest opportunity, a procedure to make it possible to hold individual Commissioners to account. Can the Council state when and in what form it will comply with this demand?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stated first of all that an amendment of the EC Treaty is required if we are to meet the demand expressed in the honourable Member"s question.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in accordance with Article 48 of the EU Treaty the Council is not the body authorised to submit proposals for an amendment of the Treaty. Instead, this is the right of the Member States or the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the Council is not in a position to answer the honourable Member"s question. </p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p class="contents">Question No 40 by <span class="bold">Mark Watts </span>(H−0331/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Outdoor religious slaughter in France</p>
<p class="contents">Over 40 000 sheep were ritually slaughtered outdoors in France this March during this year's Eid‐el‐Kabir festival. This was done in defiance of the law as both EU and French law prohibit outdoor religious slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">The animals were roughly dragged – often with their front and back legs tied together – to the slaughter point. There they were held down on wooden trestles on the ground and their throats were cut while they were fully conscious. Often the slaughter was carried out by untrained people who sawed backwards and forwards across the animals' throats sometimes with blunt knives. In many cases the animals took several minutes to die, often in great agony.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission now take action to require France to enforce the prohibition in Council Directive 93/119/EC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on outdoor religious slaughter and thereby prevent further barbaric killings taking place at next year's Eid‐el‐Kabir.</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Following intervention of the Commission, France confirmed that Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing has been fully transposed within its territory. However, the French authorities have admitted that in certain urban areas having large Muslim populations there are inadequate slaughterhouse capacities to enable the considerable number of animals required for the celebration of Eid‐el‐Kabir at the time of the festival to be slaughtered in accordance with all the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of local authorities have, for reasons of public order and public health, found it necessary to designate certain sites outside slaughterhouses for the purpose of celebration of the festival.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, taking into account the extreme sensitivity of the issue, has raised the matter within the Standing Veterinary Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States have underlined that they have transposed the directive in such a way to prohibit slaughter outside the slaughterhouses. Two Member States, Belgium and the United Kingdom, however admitted that they allowed in their national law slaughtering outside slaughterhouses for the celebration of this festival. They realise that they had interpreted Community legislation incorrectly and will change their law in order to bring it back into line with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from France, none of the other Member States seems to have capacity problems with the celebration of the festival Eid‐el‐Kabir or at least could organise the celebration of the festival in such a way that these problems do not arise. The Commission is in favour of a practical solution for the special problem concerning capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the capacity problem the honourable Member refers to the bad treatment of the animals during restraining and slaughtering. This is of course a distinct problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Bad treatment of the animals during restraining and slaughtering is not acceptable. This is a problem that can be solved easily if there is efficient control by the authorities. The Commission will therefore contact the French authorities in order to give them the opportunity to react on this problem. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 41 by <span class="bold">Jens‐Peter Bonde </span>(H−0352/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Subsidising the destruction of food</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission propose once and for all that there should be no more subsidies for the destruction of food?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Short‐term surpluses are an inherent feature of fruit and vegetable production. In a market where small surpluses can cause significant drops in market price, withdrawals are seen as being the only realistic way to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Withdrawals as such are relatively small, globally never exceeding 10 % of annual Community production in nearly 3 decades. Nonetheless, the Commission recognises the public negative image of withdrawals and addressed two issues in the 1996 reform of the common organisation of the market. Firstly, it strives to reduce the overall level of withdrawals by providing financing to improve the marketing of produce and by making the withdrawal option less attractive, and in any case not profitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it aims to reduce the level of destruction of withdrawn produce by developing various alternative uses, such as free distribution in schools, charities and humanitarian aid. Other uses include animal feed, non‐food purposes and distillation. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 42 by <span class="bold">John Iversen </span>(H−0353/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Shipments of calves</p>
<p class="contents">Shipments of calves from Denmark to the Netherlands must comply with the provisions of Directive 91/628/EEC<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the protection of animals during transport.</p>
<p class="contents">However, many reports suggest that this is not the case. Has the Commission checked whether the Member States are complying with the directive? Will it indicate the result of any inspection visits?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it have current plans to propose a total ban on the transport of calves under three months old, for example?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Transport of calves is permitted in accordance with Directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport. The point 1 of the Annex of the above‐mentioned directive states that new‐born animals in which the navel has not completely healed shall not be transported.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not receive any complaint in respect of transport of calves from Denmark to the Netherlands. As long as calves are transported according to the requirements of the directive, there should be no objection from the point of view of animal welfare to transport these animals. The aim of Community legislation in this field is to improve the condition of transport of live animals and not to ban this practice.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enforcement of the rules, the primary responsibility remains with the Member States. The Commission can nevertheless, verify the correct application of the rules within the Community and a number of inspections in the Member States concerning this specific field, have been carried out. The reports on these inspections are also available on the Commission website.</p>
<p class="contents">In cases where it is discovered that the directive is not being properly enforced by the authorities of the Member States, the Commission normally intervenes with those authorities and if the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Commission may open the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the EC Treaty (ex Article 169). </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 43 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−0361/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: LEADER III – a new future for rural development</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission give assurances that, following the conclusion of LEADER II, continuity and roll‐over will be maintained through the immediate commencement of LEADER III, that the LEADER name will be retained as it is synonymous with empowerment and self‐help within rural communities and a positive image, that it will ensure the continued bottom‐up nature of rural development and that the implementation of LEADER III will involve the same Local Action Groups?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it will endeavour to secure approval of the guidelines for the new initiative during the final quarter of 1999 so that the Member States are able to launch the new programmes at the start of the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The new initiative, which is to be known as LEADER+, will provide continuity as regards the methods and the approach adopted under LEADER II. The Commission can therefore assure the honourable Member that a ‘bottom‐up' approach will continue to be one of the main features of the new initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">However, continuity of approach does not mean that the new initiative will continue to involve the same groups. The new initiative will focus on the qualitative aspect of the rural development strategies which it supports and the local action groups currently involved may receive Community funding, provided that they satisfy the new selection criteria. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 44 by <span class="bold">Mihail Papayannakis </span>(H−0376/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: ‘Mad Cow Disease'</p>
<p class="contents">According to studies by British research institutes and concurring reports in The Lancet, Liberation and Le Monde, 'mad cow disease' continues to exact a tragic and alarming toll.</p>
<p class="contents">According to 1998 statistics, in the United Kingdom the number of fatal cases among young people of new variant CJD has increased steeply. At the same time it now seems certain that ‘mad cow disease' is crossing over to sheep. Is the Commission aware of this, and if so what is its position? Is it satisfied with the measures taken so far and the way they have been implemented in the United Kingdom?</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above developments, does it intend to propose new measures or a radical overhaul its policy so far which is closely linked to the protection of public health in the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the information to which the honourable Member is referring and shares his concerns on the implications of an increase in the number of deaths caused by variant Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease (vCJD), and the possible crossing over of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) into small ruminants. Its position was and is firmly based on this possibility of a cross over; the current preventive measures with respect to the animal waste treatment standards, the feed ban and the specified risk material elimination rules all address cattle, as well as sheep and goats. In addition the mandatory Community surveillance programme covers in principle all animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in all animal species.</p>
<p class="contents">There is to date no evidence neither from the regular inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission in the United Kingdom, nor from the scientific committees, requiring the Commission to amend its policy with respect to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following carefully the evolution of the situation as regards the incidence of vCJD, and will take any necessary public health measures, if justified. Should such recommendations be issued in future, the Commission will adapt its measures to continue to ensure the attainment of a high level of health protection based on the best available scientific evidence. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 45 by <span class="bold">Karin Riis‐Jørgensen </span>(H−0389/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Export of halal meat products to Norway</p>
<p class="contents">If a Danish company wishes to export halal meat products to Norway, it encounters trade barriers through being unable to obtain the necessary important licence in Norway. The fact is that it has still not been possible for the company in question, despite several attempts with the ‘Eggscentralen' in Norway including using a third party in Norway, to obtain an import licence. The company meets all Danish requirements concerning halal meat products. Should the company one day manage to obtain a licence, their products will nevertheless be subject to high customs duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that Norway is acting in accordance with the EEA agreement? Furthermore, does it know of any other areas where Norway is preventing EU Member States from exporting to Norway?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In general, Norway has taken over the veterinary provisions incorporated in the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the context of the EEA Agreement. Annex I of this Agreement contains a list of all the directives concerning meat and meat products as well as Council Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing. The Commission has not been informed of any general veterinary problems relating to trade between Norway and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The particular matter mentioned by the honourable Member relates to trade in meat from animals slaughtered according to certain religious rites, known as ritual slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of trade has not been formally regulated by Community legislation. In the first instance, the Commission believes that this type of trade should be possible if the meat is being sold to meet the requirements of certain religious groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will contact the Norwegian authorities to find out why this trade is not being allowed and will set out its position after having received an explanation from the Norwegian authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 46 by <span class="bold">Nikitas Kaklamanis </span>(H−0321/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Wilful omission of Greek islands from euro coins</p>
<p class="contents">In its answer to my Oral Question H−0138/99 the Commission stated for the first time that there are after all two criteria with regard to the depiction of the islands of Europe on the new euro coins: an area of at least 2500 km2 for each island and an area of more than 5000 km2 for a group of islands. It is therefore surprising to find that one of the most important archipelagos in Europe, the Aegean islands, which form an area much larger than 5000 km2, has been completely omitted from the new coins, and that islands such as Lesbos, Chios, Rhodes, Samos, Ikaria, Thasos, the Cyclades, the Sporades and others do not appear. Can the Commission say why these islands have been omitted, who is responsible and how this astonishing inaccuracy, which constitutes an affront to the nationalist sentiment of all Greeks, will be rectified?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside the issues of European and national symbolism, the depiction of islands and groups of islands on euro coins must comply with certain aesthetic and technical criteria. That is why limits have been set in relation to the sizes of the islands and archipelagos that can be depicted. As a result, islands must have an area of over 2 500 km<span class="sup">2</span> and archipelagos must have an area of at least 5 000 km<span class="sup">2</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">The groups of islands mentioned by the honourable Member are clearly too small to meet these criteria: the largest group of islands in the Aegean Sea, the Dodekanissos islands, have a total area of 2 714 km<span class="sup">2</span> , with Rhodes accounting for 1 398 km<span class="sup">2 </span> of this. The Cyclades, another large archipelago, has a total area of 2 571 km<span class="sup">2</span> , while the Sporades has an area of scarcely 400 km<span class="sup">2</span> and the island of Skyros represents around half of this, with an area of 200 km<span class="sup">2</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">The depiction of Greece and its islands responds to the criteria set out by the Council and has been approved by the Council. There are therefore no plans to change the designs, and the production of coins has begun in most Member States on the basis of the approved designs. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 47 by <span class="bold">Concepció Ferrer </span>(H−0322/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Initiatives to assist the textile and clothing industry</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 July 1998 the European Parliament adopted a resolution (A4‐0224/98) on the Commission action plan to increase the competitiveness of the European textile and clothing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission indicate what action it has taken, or will be taking, to act on the European Parliament's proposals, in particular to stimulate access to third‐country markets, by drafting a regulation accommodating Community operations to promote SMEs' exports or by coordinating national promotion campaigns?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to full integration of textiles and clothing products into GATT 1994 by 1 January 2005 as a result of the application of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), the Commission's main priority is to prepare the Community for the world‐wide competitive environment in the textiles and clothing sector. In this context the improvement for access of Community textiles and clothing products to third countries' markets is of prime importance.</p>
<p class="contents">1999 being at the middle of the transitional period of implementation of the ATC, preparatory work by the Commission is intensifying. As part of the strategy, the likely position of the Community textiles industry in the post−2005 environment will be examined, as well as the main obstacles that should be addressed in key markets. This is to help ensure that when general GATT rules will be applied to the textiles sector from 2005, there shall be a level playing field in textiles trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Better access to market of third countries will be sought through bilateral negotiations, a close monitoring of the implementation of third countries' obligations vis‐à‐vis the Community using whenever appropriate the relevant WTO mechanisms, and stepped up efforts in the fight against fraud and piracy. Another priority will be a smooth application of the bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded by the Community with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Actions for the pursuit of better market access for Community producers to third countries' markets will include the establishment of a list of priority market access objectives along with an assessment of the means to achieve them. These actions may, among others, take place in the framework of the preparation of the third phase of GATT integration, by entering into negotiations with other WTO countries to obtain better market access, in the context of the overall WTO trade negotiations that may start from year 2000 and the continuation of the pending WTO accession negotiations, notably those with Russia and China.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication with industry and other interested parties will be strengthened to facilitate the development of an active market access policy and to prepare the Community's positions in the WTO. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 48 by <span class="bold">Tony Cunningham </span>(H−0323/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Threat to great apes from illegal bushmeat trade</p>
<p class="contents">The mainly illegal bushmeat trade in Africa, contravening CITES regulations, poses a serious threat to the survival of the great apes of Africa, and other CITES‐listed protected species. In view of the links between the rapidly growing timber industry in Africa and the major increases in the commercial bushmeat trade, there is a clear need for responsible action by logging companies to discourage and restrict the hunting of or trade in protected animal species which is specifically outlawed under the international CITES convention.</p>
<p class="contents">What actions has the Commission taken to follow‐up the ACP‐EU Assembly resolution passed in March 1996, which called on the EU to require that EU companies involved in logging follow a code of conduct which ensures their activities do not assist or facilitate hunting, killing or trade in protected species? Has the Commission raised this for discussion with any of the 130 EU timber company subsidiaries operating in Africa, and has it drafted a code of conduct based on this resolution?</p>
<p class="contents">What further actions does the Commission now intend to take to combat the threat to the survival of these species?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of the grave situation of the Great Apes in Africa. Actions have been taken at several levels: </p>
<p class="contents">Commercial trade in parts or derivates of specimens of great ape species is prohibited under the provisions of CITES as it is for all other species threatened with extinction included in its Appendix I and Annex A of Council Regulation (EC) 338/97 (OJ L 61 of 3.3.97), which implements CITES in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">A ‘code of conduct' concerning issues of sustainability including biodiversity in tropical forests is currently developed at the international level. The stewardship principles under development will make clear reference to biodiversity including the Great Apes. The Community supports this international effort in various ways. It finances the Website ‘Certification Information System' (http: /www.efi.fi/cis/). In addition, the Community has funded a study on indicators and criteria of sustainable forest management undertaken by CIFOR for the discussions in the International Forum on Forests. These include biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, practical pilot exercises in Central and West Africa are supported. These include dialogues with various stakeholders including government, NGOs and logging companies. Finally, in Central Africa the Community supports a regional programme called ECOFAC which as one of its components tries to address the problems of hunting and bushmeat trade. The activities include: (i) awareness raising on biodiversity issues among local people; (ii) improvement of surveillance; (iii) development of sustainable natural resource management systems, and (iv) exploration of alternative income sources for the local population. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 49 by <span class="bold">Patricia McKenna </span>(H−0326/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Kosovo crisis</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission doing to relieve the ongoing suffering of the refugees in and around the Kosovo conflict area? How can the Commission justify any cooperation with NATO, as suggested by the meeting on the refugee crisis between Commissioner Bonino and Xavier Solana in March, when the NATO air‐strikes have greatly contributed to the refugee problem? What if any role has the WEU played in the Kosovo conflict, either as protagonist or with a view to dealing with the aftermath? What legal measures are available, locally or internationally, to prosecute those who carry out crimes in the former Yugoslavia, including the Serbians, Albanians, and the NATO leaders who authorised illegal air‐strikes against Serbia?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and the surrounding region, the Commission has decided to make an additional 150 million euro available for humanitarian assistance and to make 100 million euro available in non‐humanitarian refugee‐related support for the neighbouring countries – Albania, FYROM, Montenegro and possibly others – to help them to bear the additional costs arising from the refugee influx. Efforts will also be made, with international financial institutions, to alleviate the exceptional burdens through macroeconomic support.</p>
<p class="contents">Close coordination, in which the Commission is fully involved, takes place both in the region and in Geneva and Brussels, involving all, including NATO, who play a role in the provision of humanitarian assistance. The WEU has, in response to a Council decision in late 1998, been involved in collecting satellite images which have been used by those seeking to monitor population movements/displacements in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia at The Hague, established under UN auspices, is competent to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity arising on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, including the present crisis in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has clearly emphasised ‘that the responsibility for the armed conflict which is now taking place lies entirely with President Milosevic and his regime', who have repeatedly violated UN Security Council Resolutions, and that ‘all those who planned, authorised and executed this brutal campaign of forced deportation, torture and murder should be held personally accountable and be brought to justice before the ICTY'. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 50 by <span class="bold">Brian Crowley </span>(H−0378/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Housing and the Kosovo crisis</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the Kosovo refugee crisis, will the Commission state if it has any plans to allow EU funds to be used for urgent temporary housing/renovation projects in the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">On December 16 1998 the Commission proposed a Joint Action to provide practical support to the reception and voluntary return of refugees, displaced persons and asylum seekers. At the request of the special Justice and Home Affairs Council of 7 April, this proposal was amended to also include measures on emergency assistance to those who have fled as a result of recent events in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The terms of the Joint Action, which the Council approved on 27 April allow for measures for accommodation purposes and thus, in all likelihood, there will be funding for accommodation. However, this will depend on the applications the Commission receives from Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget allocation is EUR 15 m and priority will be given to Kosovo related measures. The budgetary authority has the possibility, under the terms of the Joint Action, to increase the budgetary reference which would then make more funding available for either Kosovo measures or general reception and voluntary repatriation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the process of consulting both government departments and non‐governmental organisations to determine how funding can be implemented most effectively. These will then submit a limited number of proposals for measures for Kosovo refugees in the first instance.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission can state that, in the framework of the structural funds, Member States may also, under limited conditions, initiate projects to renovate accommodation when this forms part of a project to renew the fabric of run‐down urban districts. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Danger of environmental damage in the Balkans</p>
<p class="contents">Owing to bombing raids on refineries and fuel depots in Yugoslavia, thousands of tonnes of toxic and hazardous substances have escaped into the atmosphere. Moreover, it is reported that the GAU 8/A Avenger weapons system is being used in the bombing: its projectiles are reinforced with radioactive uranium and have the potential to cause catastrophic environmental damage. The radioactive uranium which is released into the atmosphere creates a toxic cloud which can travel quite far and falls to earth as soon as it rains. Is the Commission aware that these weapons systems are being used and, if so, what measures does it intend to take to stop them being used and to avert the danger of an environmental disaster?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no knowledge of the weapon systems used and has no intention to interfere with matters which are clearly not of its competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Any environmental implication of this conflict, whichever its origin, can only be assessed once it will be possible to start rehabilitation programmes. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 52 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−0327/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Recruitment of staff in new hospitals funded under the second CSF</p>
<p class="contents">Under the convergence programme in Greece and the associated rationalisation measures, one person is to be recruited to the public service for every five persons leaving, while in the health and education sectors and in the police forces one person is to be recruited for every one person leaving.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission has approved the construction of 14 new hospitals, to be funded under the second Community support framework. Many of these have already been built but are not yet operational since they do not have the necessary staff. Most of the new establishments are university hospitals, their chief purpose being to improve the regional health services and reinforce the national health system. This has resulted in a total of about 5000 additional hospital beds, for which extra staff are needed. The restrictions imposed by the convergence programme must accordingly be lifted so that the requisite new posts can be created.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission review the convergence programme for Greece concerning recruitment in the health sector, so that the necessary staff can be provided, thereby ensuring that the enormous investments made under the second CSF do not go to waste?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">According to Regulation 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 ‘on the strengthening of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies', the Commission prepares assessments of stability or convergence programmes submitted by Member States and makes recommendations for Council Options. The Commission is not entitled to revise the stability or convergence programmes submitted by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the above Regulation, the convergence or stability programmes must provide information about the economic situation and prospects and the budgetary strategy that the Member States intend to implement in order to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact. Within this context the Member States are not required by the Regulation to respect specific norms for a single project or activity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek convergence programme for the period 1999‐2001 incorporates, among measures aimed at containing growth of public expenditure, a norm – already included in the 1998 budget – which provides for one new recruitment for every five civil servants leaving service, with the exception of education, health and the defence sectors where the ratio is 1: 1. How such a norm would be made compatible with investments made within the Community Support Framework is an issue pertaining to Greece in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 53 by <span class="bold">Paul Lannoye </span>(H−0330/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Drogenbos incinerator</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 March, a number of opponents of the plans for a household waste incinerator at Drogenbos, just outside the capital of Europe, lodged a complaint with the Commission alleging a breach of the environmental impact assessment directive. The Commission found a series of shortcomings in the impact assessment and, on 21 January 1999, sent a letter of formal notice to Belgium which was given two months to provide an explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the widespread opposition to the project, above all because of concerns about the dangers it poses to public health and the environment and the failure to respect the precautionary principle, those behind the project are carrying on undeterred.</p>
<p class="contents">The deadline given to the Belgium state has now passed. Can the Commission say what its reaction is to the explanations provided by the Belgium state?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Following the initial assessment of various complaints lodged against the Drogenbos incinerator project, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Belgium, in accordance with Article 226 (ex Article 169) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received a response from the Belgian authorities to that letter and is currently examining it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that in all likelihood the Commission will only decide how to follow up the present infringement proceedings when it receives a response from the Belgian authorities to the additional letter of formal notice it recently decided to send. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 54 by <span class="bold">Eva Kjer Hansen </span>(H−0332/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: New German tax rules applying to foreign contractors</p>
<p class="contents">Under new tax laws applying from 1 April, a German client buying a house from a foreign building firm is only required to pay 75 % of the cost to the contractor when taking possession of the house. The German house‐buyer is required to send the remaining 25 % of the building cost to the tax authorities no later than eight days after taking possession. The foreign building firm cannot apply to have the balance due to it from the tax authorities until the following year. The introduction of these rules amounts to pure German protectionism and an obstruction to trade contrary to EU rules. This legislation means in practice that foreign firms must give the German tax authorities an interest‐free loan for up to one year.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Commission take (or has it taken) to put an end to this unreasonable discrimination against foreign companies in Germany where, under new tax rules, foreign companies, but not German companies, are required to deposit 25 % of their contract proceeds with the tax authorities?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has just received the text of the German Act published on 31 March 1999 and has immediately started to examine it. The Commission will come to an early assessment of the compatibility of the new rules, against which formal complaints from affected enterprises have also already been received.</p>
<p class="contents">The new German tax rules aim at combating tax fraud; such rules are welcomed by the Commission. They must however respect Community law, in particular the freedom to provide services and the principles of non‐discrimination and proportionality. It is true that the 25 % withholding tax (as a guarantee deposit for potential tax liability) appears rather high and might prove to go beyond the legitimate aim.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is waiting for a clarification on the practice on the delivery of the waiver certificates. This should result from a coordination meeting of the tax administrations of the German Länder in charge of the application at the end of April 1999. It will be in the light of the effective application of the Act that the Commission will have to decide whether there are grounds to open infringement proceedings against Germany. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 55 by <span class="bold">Luciano Vecchi </span>(H−0333/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Observers at the elections in Nigeria in February 1999</p>
<p class="contents">During the Nigerian National Assembly and presidential elections (held on 20 February 1999 and 27 February 1999 respectively), the EU Member States and the Commission sent over a hundred observers to monitor the election process.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the reports and comments by the observers expressed harsh criticism of the way in which polling was conducted in many areas of Nigeria. In particular, there are substantial discrepancies in both timing and content between the statement presented by the Commission delegate in Nigeria and the reports by the observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Nigeria has undeniably made considerable progress in recent months on the difficult road towards democracy, this situation has led to much tension between many observers and the Community institutions and raises serious questions about the real task which the observers were called upon to perform.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say why the assessments of the observers sent by the EU and the Member States to monitor the conduct of the elections in Nigeria have not been taken properly into account? In the circumstances, does it give its political endorsement to the actions of the spokesman for the EU observers' mission, Ambassador Hans‐Günter Sulimma?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully agrees that the way the polling was conducted in many areas of Nigeria deserves criticism. The Union statement, based on Ambassador Sulimma's conclusions, states clearly that a number of serious irregularities were encountered. The observers have thus performed an extremely useful task in exposing these irregularities, which point up the fragile nature of the current transition in Nigeria. The Presidency statement also calls for the irregularities to be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">This evidence from the observers has led the Commission to examine, together with other donors, future support for strengthening of the Electoral Commission, to ensure more effective performance in future elections. Democracy in Nigeria has advanced dramatically over the past year, but it will take much longer than one year for democratic practices and attitudes to be entrenched securely.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that Ambassador Sulimma did take proper account of these assessments of the observers in his statement on the Presidential elections. His judgement, based on the initial reports, is justified by later detailed analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">The election process consisted of four stages: accreditation, voting, counting and collation. Union observers reported serious irregularities, at these four stages, in 10 %, 28 %, 16 % and 5 % of cases respectively. The most irregularities (28 %), then, were observed at the voting stage. Given that observers also noted that these irregularities (ballot‐stuffing, etc.) were committed by both parties, it is reasonable to conclude that they did not affect the overall outcome, in which Olusegun Obasanjo defeated Olu Falae by a margin of 24 % (62 % to 38 %). This important conclusion was also reached by other groups of observers.</p>
<p class="contents">After an election, information reaches the Union spokesman at a high rate. First he receives initial and partial reports, and later more detailed reports. His analysis of them also becomes more detailed and complete as time passes. His information is primarily from Union observers, but he also stays in contact with other observer missions to know what information they are receiving.</p>
<p class="contents">At some point it becomes possible for him to make a confident judgement as to the overall nature of the process. It is essential that he release a statement as early as possible after this point, since the relevance of statements decreases rapidly, the later they are released. This is a very difficult determination to make. Ambassador Sulimma made the judgement that this point had been reached on Sunday 28 February. His judgement has been confirmed by later analyses from different sources. They indicate that there were indeed serious irregularities; but that there is no evidence suggesting that the true result was other than a victory for Obasanjo. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 56 by <span class="bold">Anne McIntosh </span>(H−0335/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Duty‐free sales</p>
<p class="contents">What interim measures does the Commission intend to take to simplify sales after intra‐EU duty‐free sales stop on 1 July 1999, in order to prevent different prices being charged for the same product depending on which territorial waters or airspace the sale is made in?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the various discussions which have taken place, particularly within Parliament, on the forthcoming abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free sales, the Commission has explained what the situation of such sales will be vis‐à‐vis the normal rules on taxation with effect from 1 July 1999. No transitional measures are envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has for a number of months been in contact with the authorities which are responsible in the Member States for implementing the relevant Community provisions and with operators (ferry companies, airlines, etc.), with a view to determining the conditions under which the taxes are to be levied.</p>
<p class="contents">To help clarify matters for the benefit of the general public and the various interested parties, the Commission has also recently published, on 10 April 1999, a communication on the subject in the Official Journal. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 57 by <span class="bold">John McCartin </span>(H−0363/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Action to tackle specific employment problems related to duty‐free sales</p>
<p class="contents">What follow up action has been undertaken by the Commission following the Commission's Communication of November 1998 on offsetting the possible consequences of the abolition of intra‐EU duty‐free sales? Has the Commission received any specific requests from any Member States regarding the reallocation of existing Structural Funds towards such measures or has the Commission received any request from the Council for the creation of a new separate measure to tackle any specific and local employment problems that may arise?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Vienna (11 and 12 December 1998), with regard to the decision of 1991 on tax‐free sales for intra‐Community travellers, asked the Commission and the Council (ECOFIN) to examine by March 1999 the problems which could arise with regard to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It invited them to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling these problems, including the possibility of a limited extension of the transitional arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">In response, the Commission adopted a Communication on the subject on 17 February 1999, which was transmitted to the Council, Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. This Communication concluded that an extension of the transitional period is not the appropriate response to specific and locally identified problems, but that Member States must fully use the existing Community funds to solve such difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">No specific request from any Member State has been received regarding reallocation of existing structural funds in this context. The Council has not yet examined the above‐mentioned communication of the Commission, in particular as regards the need to create a separate new measure to tackle any specific and local employment problems that may arise. </p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Phare‐Lien programme Application 98‐1218</p>
<p class="contents">This application concerns partners in Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Albania and, in the EU, the European Union of Women. It aimed to generate potential to participate in the democratic process. Can the Commission now state fully why the application did not fulfil all the eligibility and conformity criteria defined in the LIEN 1998 guidelines? If the objection was that the European Union of Women is a political organisation, why was this not made clear at the outset, especially since EUW was given the indication that, so long as the project was open to all, this would not affect how the application was viewed? Why did it take the Commission until March 1999 to respond to an application submitted in May 1998?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can confirm that the proposal from the European Union of Women failed to meet the eligibility criteria of the LIEN programme. The screening of the eligibility of all organisations who applied for the programme was based solely on the criteria indicated in the LIEN guidelines made available to all applicants. These eligibility criteria require, in particular, proof of status as a non‐governmental and non‐profit organisation, as well as official registration (with statutes) and certain other criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of the total number of 238 project proposals, 39 were eliminated in the initial screening as they did not fulfil the required eligibility criteria. The proposal of the EUW was among them. It failed in particular to provide proof of its own and its partners' status as an NGO. However, the EUW was not disqualified because it is a political organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">After being informed about the selection results, the EUW requested additional information about the selection. The EUW was provided with a detailed written reply explaining the points where the proposal of the EUW did not meet the required criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a delay in processing the applications due to difficulties in contracting technical assistance to help with the execution of the programme, as well as staff changes and reorganisation within the Commission. However, the project selection has now been completed and implementation is now beginning. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 59 by <span class="bold">Claude Delcroix </span>(H−0338/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Proliferation of chemical substances</p>
<p class="contents">The proliferation of chemical substances, whose number increased from 212, 000 in 1965 to 18 million in 1998, is perturbing in that profit is the sole driving force and consumer health is merely secondary. Is the European Union aware of the dangers and how does it ensure compliance with the precautionary principle? Mr Larbi Bougherra, President of the human progress foundation, suspects MMT, the compound which has replaced lead in petrol to maintain a good octane rating, to be highly toxic, carcinogenic and dangerous for human health and the environment. Is the Commission aware of this fact, and what is it doing to ascertain the innocuousness of the new products that are flooding the market each day?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of human health, including that of consumers, and of the environment against the possible dangers of chemical substances is guaranteed by many Community legislative instruments. Among other things, these directives and regulations set out the rules on the classification, packaging and labelling of chemical substances and preparations for products they are used in, as well as the limitations on marketing and using certain dangerous substances and preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for these rules at national level guarantees the high level of protection for health and the environment in the Community. The Commission is anxious to maintain and improve this level of protection. It has therefore assessed the Community"s system of ‘chemical" legislation and a report has been adopted on this following the first stage. At the end of this assessment, the Commission will forward a communication to Parliament and to the Council bringing together all the elements for a future Community ‘chemical" strategy, including legislative options.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards MMT, this manganese‐based compound is added to petrol or diesel to increase the level of octane with a view to improving combustion.</p>
<p class="contents">Although manganese is an essential nutrient at low levels, high‐level manganese exposure leads to a characteristic severe nervous system toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity also occurs at high levels of exposure. Selected subpopulations may be especially susceptible to the toxic effects due to high levels of exposure to manganese, for instance, workers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the protection of workers that could be exposed to MMT, Council Directive 98/24/EC on the protection of workers from chemical agents specifies in its Article 4 that the employer must evaluate the risks of exposure, taking into account all available information, and establish the necessary protection measures to reduce the exposure.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies have shown that only a very small percentage of the manganese from MMT added to fuels was diffused in the atmosphere. However, the products of MMT combustion may have a negative effect on equipment that controls vehicle emissions, such as catalytic converters or OBD systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the use of fuels containing manganese is not recommended by car manufacturers. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 60 by <span class="bold">Manuel Medina Ortega </span>(H−0340/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Development of Article 299(2)</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the imminent entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, what initiatives is the Commission preparing for the development of Article 299(2) on the status of the outermost regions?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member points out, the specific characteristics of the outermost regions has been enshrined in a new Article 299 in the Treaty of Amsterdam. This includes a very specific list of the regions involved and sets out the obstacles to their development: ‘the structural social and economic situation of the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands ... is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development".</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, the Commission proposed that all the outermost regions should be eligible for Objective 1 status for the 2000‐2006 period, irrespective of their per capita GDP. Nonetheless, the Council amended the Commission"s proposal by stating in Article 3(1) of the regulation laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds that all the ultra‐peripheral regions should be below the threshold of 75 % of the Community average in terms of per capita GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards the level of Community contributions, the specific treatment granted to the outermost regions is preserved and enables us to increase this level to a maximum of 85 % of the total eligible costs, in comparison to only 75 % in the other regions eligible for Objective 1 status. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 61 by <span class="bold">Arthur Newens </span>(H−0344/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The case of Abdullah Öcalan in Turkey</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission make a statement about any approaches it has made to the Turkish authorities about the arrest and anticipated trial of Abdullah Öcalan and any replies it may have received?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 February 1999, the Union adopted a declaration on the arrest and the subsequent trial of Abdullah Öcalan and the Commission fully supports that declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular the Commission insists that the trial should be open, according to the rule of law, before an independent court with access to legal counsel of Mr Öcalan's choice and with international observers present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets the reply by Turkish authorities not to admit international observers, and has taken notice of the assurance that the trial should be open to the public. The prosecutor's report for the death penalty is deeply regretted. The Commission will continue to follow the trial and its proceedings with much attention. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 62 by <span class="bold">Antonios Trakatellis </span>(H−0347/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Nuclear safety in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the NIS</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament resolution on nuclear safety related activities for the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the NIS<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> calls on Lithuania and Bulgaria to comply with their commitments under the agreements with the Nuclear Safety Account (NSA) with regard to the conditional closure of nuclear reactors 1 to 4 at Kozloduy and 1 and 2 at Ignalina respectively and calls on the Commission to draw up an energy strategy for each of the CEEC and NIS countries in which provision is made for the closure of first‐generation nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">What initiatives has the Commission taken in this respect and what results have been achieved with Bulgaria and Lithuania? What immediate measures does it intend to take to ensure that first‐generation reactors in Bulgaria and Lithuania close in accordance with the commitments made by these two countries under the partnership agreements and with the NSA? Have the two countries concerned called into question the agreements with the NSA and what is the Commission's position on this matter?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has repeatedly stated clearly to the Lithuanian and Bulgarian authorities that the plants should be shut down in accordance with the commitments taken by both countries in the framework of the agreements signed with the Nuclear Safety Account (NSA), since these reactors are ‘non upgradable' at a reasonable cost. Realistic closure dates must be agreed, consistent with the agreements, while the Commission is willing to assist the two countries in fulfilling their obligations. These statements have been made in Agenda 2000, in the Accession Partnerships, in the 1998 Regular Reports and in a number of letters sent to the Lithuanian and Bulgarian Governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lithuanian and Bulgarian authorities have indicated on a number of occasions that they envisage closure dates inconsistent with the NSA Agreement. The Bulgarian government had even requested a revision of the Agreement, a request that was rejected by the NSA Contributors. However, as a result of recent consultations with the Commission, it has been agreed to set up joint working groups, which will assist the two countries in implementing their international obligations. The working groups will evaluate decommissioning costs and socio‐economic consequences deriving from the shutdown of the concerned nuclear plants, and will assess the modalities and amount of necessary financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The first meeting of the Commission‐Lithuania joint working group took place in Vilnius on 14‐16 April 1999. A meeting of the Commission‐Bulgaria joint working group is expected to take place in Sofia in May. A satisfactory conclusion of the work of these groups will allow for the subsequent agreement on the closures to be reflected in the 1999 Regular Reports. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 63 by <span class="bold">Raúl Rosado Fernandes </span>(H−0350/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: BSE</p>
<p class="contents">While the report by Mr Böge and Mrs Roth‐Behrendt on BSE was very thorough, it failed to refer to the report by Dr Capellaro which drew attention to shortcomings at 26 animal feed plants in Spain in 1997‐98.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say whether or not the Spanish authorities subsequently banned him from entering this Member State as an inspector?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of the rendering plants in Spain, described in the report of October 1997 (XXIV/2043/97), was followed‐up in September/October 1998 and improvements were reported.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission's role to nominate experts to carry out missions on the basis of their expertise, and Member States are obliged to collaborate with the inspectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not been informed by the Spanish authorities that the inspector in question will not be accepted ‘a posteriori' in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">The same inspector participated in two further missions to Spain in January and April 1998, carried out in the framework of the Classical Swine Fever epidemic. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 64 by <span class="bold">Pat Gallagher </span>(H−0355/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Embezzlement of EU fishing funds</p>
<p class="contents">An auditors' report has severely criticised the Commission for failing to take adequate precautions to prevent fraud involving a multi‐million pound EU programme to modernise nearly 200 fishing vessels, most of which are in southern Europe. Millions of pounds have been claimed in respect of ships that have already sunk or which are barely seaworthy. Only a few EU verification visits were made.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission state what efforts it is making to get back EU funds wrongfully paid out and will it indicate what provisions there are for penalties to be applied?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member appears to be referring to the report by the Court of Auditors on Community measures to promote the setting‐up of joint ventures in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The report was concerned with the failure, by the recipients of funding for the setting‐up of joint ventures, to comply with Community rules, and also with the loopholes in those rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the comments made by the Court of Auditors, the Commission has taken the following action: </p>
<p class="contents">. It has checked all the cases mentioned in the Court's report and has recovered the amounts due. In this connection the Commission: </p>
<p class="contents">. is in the process of forwarding to the Member States a list of the vessels in receipt of Community construction or modernisation aid which have not fulfilled the conditions required under the rules and has asked them to recover the amounts due. This exercise will be completed in the case of all the Member States by 30 June 1999; </p>
<p class="contents">. is carrying out all the necessary checks concerning the six vessels referred to by the Court (out of a total of 290 vessels for which funding was provided) which sank following the granting of the aid. The Commission considers that the principle whereby the sunken vessels must be replaced should be applied. If they are not replaced, up to half of the aid granted would have to be repaid – a proportion to be calculated on a <span class="italic">pro rata</span> basis, according to how much of the compulsory three‐year period of operation had been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">. The Member States have been reminded of their obligations as regards the management and the monitoring of joint‐venture projects.</p>
<p class="contents">. In the proposed new FIFG regulation the provisions relating to joint ventures have been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules relating to penalties are currently contained in Article 44 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 and Article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 of 20 July 1993 and they provide for the suspension of, a reduction in or the withdrawal of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion on the 1997 discharge (which was adopted on 16 February 1998), Parliament's Committee on Fisheries asked the Commission to submit to Parliament and the Council, by the end of 1999, a detailed report describing both the action taken to remedy the dysfunctions brought to light by the Court of Auditors and the rules and provisions adopted in order to close the loopholes in the laws relating to joint ventures. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 65 by <span class="bold">James Fitzsimons </span>(H−0357/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU assistance for local authorities in safeguarding the environment</p>
<p class="contents">Naas Urban District Council in County Kildare in Ireland has decided to provide skips to housing estates to assist their estate maintenance/management activities during the year. Would EU support be available for such initiatives throughout the Leinster constituency and will the Commission indicate what assistance is available at EU level to enable local authorities to safeguard the environment?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Since Ireland is an Objective 1 region, European funds are available to the Irish authorities for various projects and programmes. It is a matter for the Irish authorities to nominate the measures to be funded under each programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the general question relating to what Community assistance is available to safeguard the environment, the current Community Support Framework (CSF) contains an Operational Programme for Environmental Services for such assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it is worth noting that the National Authorities are currently preparing the new Regional Development Plans to cover the period 2000‐2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It is expected that in addition to the provision of direct measures to safeguard the environment, the next CSF will integrate environmental issues throughout the various programmes. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 66 by <span class="bold">Niall Andrews </span>(H−0359/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Crime in the city</p>
<p class="contents">Surveys undertaken either through Eurobarometer, the United Nations or in individual Member States consistently show the citizens are very worried about crime and their personal safety in cities throughout the European Union. On the basis of the new Amsterdam Treaty what reassurances can the Commission give that the European Union can do something positive to make our local neighbourhoods safer places in which to live and work?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of the honourable Member that European citizens have strong expectations that the EU should address not only the issue of fighting against organised crime, but also the problems of urban criminality and that the EU contributes to ensure a secure environment for the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty, great efforts will continue to be made in the fight against transborder types of crime. This priority has been addressed in the EU Action Plan to combat organised crime, adopted in 1997. The Commission has actively contributed to its implementation and considers that a number of initiatives deriving from it have had a direct effect on citizens' daily life. Good examples are the fight against trafficking in human beings, the fight against trafficking in drugs, stealing of vehicles or different forms of financial crime. These initiatives have all contributed to increase the general level of security in urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning urban security and police tasks, cooperation between European police authorities on issues of security management, including urban security, have been going on for a number of years. One of the last examples is the Joint Action on Prevention of Hooliganism. The Joint Action is expected to be finalised in the near future. In addition, an initiative has been started to collect and disseminate information on good practice at the level of police authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has examined how it could mobilise existing financial instruments of the EU in creating a more secure urban environment. Projects aimed at increasing safety as a precondition for economic development have been financed last year by the European Fund for Regional Development. It remains, however, the initiative of national and regional authorities to introduce such projects. In the area of social policy, some budget lines also contribute to improving the economic situation in specific neighbourhoods. The budget lines related to the Integra employment programme, the poverty programme, the town twinning programme and above all, the Urban initiatives have all directly or indirectly contributed to reduce violence and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the specific issue of urban security, the Commission proposed in autumn 1998 an Action Plan for urban sustainable development on which the European Parliament is presently consulted. This Action Plan considers four interrelated objectives concerning economic development, social and urban rehabilitation, environment and good governance. Under this last objective, the Commission will support new strategies to promote urban security issues. In particular, the Commission intends to promote the setting up of prevention policies against urban crime, including juvenile delinquency, support initiatives of NGOs, networking of persons responsible for crime prevention as well as exchange of experience and multidisciplinary training.</p>
<p class="contents">A first step in this direction has already been taken within the programmes in the area of Justice and Home Affairs. Both the OISIN and the Falcone programmes are open to cooperation projects of local and regional authorities as well as to NGOs. Their purpose is to facilitate dissemination of knowledge, to encourage contacts between actors engaged in providing a secure environment and to support reflections on best practice on how to improve security and prevent certain forms of crime which occur at urban level. As an example, the OISIN programme supports two projects on urban security and on proximity police. The Falcone programme will have to decide in the coming days on projects concerning a study on the relation between small crime and organised crime and a coordinated system for dissemination of best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to examine the experience and needs at local level and determine where and how the EU dimension can best be used in order to assure a safe local neighbourhood. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 67 by <span class="bold">Carlo Ripa di Meana </span>(H−0362/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Provision of know‐how and financial support to the Shifco fleet by the EC</p>
<p class="contents">A civil lawsuit has been taken out at a Rome court by the owner of the Shifco fleet, the engineer Omar Said Mugne, against the authors and publishers of a book entitled ‘L'esecuzione' (published by Kaos). The plaintiff claims that the EC, through the ‘provision of know‐how and financial support for the modernisation of the fleet', effectively offered ‘recognition' of the activities of Shifco as being proper and correct – despite the confirmations in the Italian press that Mr Mugne is under investigation by the Italian legal authorities for arms dealing. Mr Mugne, in his submission to the Rome civil court, cites the testimony of Mr Pietro Pietrucci, of the ‘cabinet' of Commissioner Emma Bonino.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission state what kind of know‐how it provided to the Shifco fleet, when, and on whose initiative; what financial support it provided to the Shifco fleet, when, through what department and on whose initiative; what the official role is within Commissioner Bonino's ‘cabinet' of Mr Pietro Pietrucci; and whether he has, or has ever had, working relations with Mr Omar Said Mugne.</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not following the case currently being considered in the Rome court, which was mentioned by the honourable Member, and it has no knowledge of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not provide the Shifco company with any know‐how or financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission carried out a veterinary inspection of the Shifco fleet on 18 November 1998 with a view to verifying its sanitary conditions. This was in response to the request from the Shifco company for authorisation to import EU fisheries products, on the basis of Article 11(6) of Council Directive 91/493/EC. The results of this inspection are available on the Internet, as they are for all veterinary inspections. These results were presented to the Standing Veterinary Committee on 15 and 16 December 1998 and the Commission has not yet decided whether to grant Shifco authorisation to import fisheries products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Petrucci, who has been Commissioner Emma Bonino"s spokesman since 1 July 1998, has no working relations with the Shifco company and has never had any such relations in the past. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 68 by <span class="bold">Paul Rübig </span>(H−0367/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Timing of the count following the elections to the European Parliament</p>
<p class="contents">Article 9(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 provides for the counting of votes only after close of polling in all other Member States. In two countries the polling stations close at 10 p.m. on election day. According to the current legislation the count can only be started at that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that this provision will enhance the popularity of the European elections with the election officials or rather, in line with the idea of encouraging voters, should a more appropriate environment not be created? Is there sufficient acceptance across the Union for this interference with accepted electoral practices and for certain anticipated increased costs (by about 30 %), although at least one Member State is setting a different and shorter waiting period? In the Commission's view how can the announcement of the election results before the closure of the last polling station be prevented, while adapting the system to the needs of the election officials? When will this provision be adjusted with a view to the European elections on 13 June?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">This matter does not come under the Commission"s responsibilities. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 69 by <span class="bold">Jonas Sjöstedt </span>(H−0370/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Protection of persons providing information</p>
<p class="contents">Before the Commission resigned, Paul van Buitenen, the internal auditor, was suspended from duty on half pay. Since then, he has obtained a new post in another Commission department. This and similar cases raise the question of the need to allow Commission staff the freedom to provide information, which in Sweden, for example, is a right enshrined in the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that the right of Commission staff to provide information should now be a matter for debate in the light of events prior to the Commission's resignation?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has noted the honourable Member"s comments regarding the freedom of expression of the Commission"s staff and the staff of the other institutions. Possible solutions to this must be considered in the light of their own merits and the practices in all the Member States of the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 70 by <span class="bold">Philippe Monfils </span>(H−0371/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The UIP case</p>
<p class="contents">The cartel of three major Hollywood film studios (UIP) which have pooled their distribution services for Europe is covered by a derogation under Article 85(3) of the Treaty of Rome. This derogation is due to expire, and the Commission is currently considering whether or not to renew it. Given the significance of the UIP case – which cannot be treated as run‐of‐the‐mill – and the enormous political pressure which is being brought to bear on the Commission in this connection, should the outgoing Commission not postpone taking a decision on this matter, so as to allow the new Commission to take a decision which is of vital importance for the future of the European film industry?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">Since UIP in 1993 applied for a renewal of the 1989 exemption, the Commission has thoroughly investigated whether UIP has been involved in any anti‐competitive behaviour or activities not envisaged at the time of the previous exemption. The Commission has also examined UIP's effects on the film distribution market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has notably found that, although the market has shown a sound tendency of growth and expansion, UIP's Community wide market share has decreased from 22 % in 1989 to 13 % in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, UIP is willing to give a number of new undertakings to accommodate concerns raised against UIP (e.g. UIP will not coordinate the release dates of the parties' films or use block bookings).</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is likely to publish a notice in the Official Journal soon inviting third parties to comment on a possible renewal of the exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">In competition cases, where the Commission acts as the guardian of the Treaties, the outgoing Commission continues to assume its responsibilities and considers that there is no reason to postpone procedures. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 71 by <span class="bold">José Valverde López </span>(H−0374/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: EU model for medical prescriptions</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of persons, freedom of establishment for health professionals and the single market in medicines mean that a single model for medical prescriptions must be established. This must include a diagnosis or diagnostic indications. If effective information is to be provided to the patient and medication is to be monitored, an individual ‘health card' is also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider it necessary to undertake technical studies and consult the interested parties with a view to introducing legislation in the forthcoming months to lay down a model for medical prescriptions and ‘health card'?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following closely key developments in Member States' health systems, including the impact of internal market legislation on the health sector in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope for legislation, however, is limited by the public health provisions of the Treaty, which leave Member States responsible for the financing and organisation of their health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards medical prescriptions, the Commission does not at present consider that introducing a uniform model is necessary in order to guarantee the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the introduction of health cards, the Commission refers the honourable Member to the follow‐up it has given to the Parliament's resolution of 17.04.1996 on the Leopardi report (OJ C 141 of 13.05.1996, p. 104). It still considers that major legal, political and technical obstacles remain before the development of Community legislation in this field could be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in close cooperation with Member States' Ministries of Health, continues to keep both matters under consideration. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 72 by <span class="bold">Konstantinos Hatzidakis </span>(H−0380/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Utilisation by the Greek government of Community funds to highlight Government achievements prior to the elections</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government has recently been using Community resources to fund a series of advertising campaigns to draw attention to the Greek Community Support Framework; however they fail sufficiently to highlight the Community nature of the projects concerned and overemphasise the Government's contribution. There are also reports of similar campaigns to be launched shortly. These campaigns coincide with a large‐scale election campaign by the Government party which also makes extensive reference to Agenda 2000: this makes Greek citizens even more confused. All these measures are being taken a mere two months before the Euro‐elections in June 1999 when the country is in a pre‐electoral period, and the impression is easily created that Community resources are being used to fund the Government's election campaign. Given that in similar circumstances in the local elections in 1998 the Commission, following my question (H−0543/98)<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> , intervened with the Greek Government and reached an agreement with the latter that the information campaign should be postponed until after the two‐month pre‐electoral period, will it say whether it intends to take similar action in this case, since the problem is on a larger scale this time because European elections are involved?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 77 by <span class="bold">Georgios Anastassopoulos </span>(H−0390/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Use of Community funding for government publicity in the run‐up to elections</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission not carry out the necessary checks to ensure that the funds provided from the various Community programmes (Community Support Framework, European Social Fund etc.) are actually used to promote the Community's contribution to the development of the Greek economy and not for government publicity?</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that this tendency has recently become more pronounced in the run‐up to the European elections on 13 June, will the Commission say what measures it has taken and whether it considers it appropriate that these government campaigns with Community money be stopped and information to the Greek public about Community programmes be resumed after 15 June, as happened last year before the regional and local elections in Greece?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already set out its position on this issue at Parliament"s part‐session of June 1998<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> . In general, it is satisfied with the implementation of the publicity and information campaigns that are cofinanced by the ‘technical assistance" operational programme of the Community support framework for Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">A group made up of representatives of the relevant ministry and the Commission, under the authority of the programme"s monitoring committee, supervises the campaign and decides on the measures that are to be taken in case of any specific problems. It was in this context that it was decided last year to temporarily suspend the campaign during the local elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The same reasoning applies to the campaign before the European elections. As a result, the Greek authorities announced that the campaign would be suspended from 1 May to mid‐June. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 73 by <span class="bold">María Sornosa Martínez </span>(H−0382/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Measures to reform large psychiatric hospitals and promotion of out‐patient facilities in Greece</p>
<p class="contents">In 1984, the EU began to subsidise – and is continuing to do so – the improvement of mental health services in Greece, initially through Regulation 815/84/EEC<a href="#def_1_6" name="ref_1_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and subsequently through the Psychargo programme. The results so far have been poor. The fundamental reasons why there has been no reform of the mental health system to date are that the experience, planning and efficiency of the mental health services in the other Member States have not been taken on board, that the funds given to the big psychiatric hospitals have not significantly changed their outmoded practices and that the Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare has not taken a global approach to planning, using a timetable and, principally, Greek government resources to set up and operate services in the community (outpatient facilities).</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission change the entire modus operandi of the system by implementing the Psychargo programme and what practical measures are planned to improve the effectiveness of reforms in the large psychiatric hospitals and to promote outpatient facilities?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 74 by <span class="bold">Honório Novo </span>(H−0383/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Effectiveness of Psychargo programme funding in Greece</p>
<p class="contents">The state of Greek psychiatric units (asylums) and the inadequate standard of psychiatric prevention and care generally, together with the failure of Regulation 815/84/EEC<a href="#def_1_7" name="ref_1_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> and the ineffective use of resources allocated under this Regulation, have occasionally exercised the European Parliament, the relevant Commission services and the international media.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek governments between 1984 and 1995 and also the Commission have been held responsible for failing to implement the five‐year psychiatric reform plan drawn up in 1984: resources were misallocated and the programme was a failure so that the shortcomings persist to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission say whether the relevant Commission services have taken measures to ensure that the new funding for the Psychargo programme is allocated effectively?</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 75 by <span class="bold">Pedro Marset Campos </span>(H−0384/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Improving the functioning of psychiatric asylums and the network of outpatient facilities</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has already considered the tragic state of psychiatric care in Greece. One of the most serious problems which Regulation 815/84/EEC<a href="#def_1_8" name="ref_1_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> failed to address successfully was the lack of basic outpatient facilities, mental health centres, mobile units, day centres, child‐guidance centres, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Today only a small portion of the population is covered by these services. However, experience in the EU Member States shows that an improvement in the functioning of asylums and de‐institutionalisation are impossible unless such a network of outpatient facilities exists. Will the Commission say whether it intends, in cooperation with the Greek government, to use the new subsidies that have been approved under the Psychargo programme for this purpose?</p>
<p class="contents">Joint answer</p>
<p class="contents">Under Regulation 815/84 an important reform was introduced into the Greek psychiatric care system involving the gradual replacement of the institution‐based system of psychiatric care by a network of alternative prevention led and therapeutic mental health services and facilities based in the community or in general hospitals. Moreover, provision was made for the development of social and vocational rehabilitation services throughout the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation 815/84 applied from 1984 to 1995. After 1995, psychiatric reform remained fragile because it had not been accompanied by the required legal and administrative arrangements for its consolidation and further development.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to secure a more systematic continuation of the reform in the context of the 1994‐99 Community Support Framework for Greece, and in particular under the Operational Programme on Combating Exclusion from the Labour Market, the Commission requested the Greek authorities to prepare an action plan for the completion and consolidation of psychiatric reform. In the framework of this plan, which has been called ‘PSYCHARGOS', actions eligible under Structural Fund Regulations could be financed by the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, a Bill on Mental Health was drafted. It is expected to be adopted soon by the Greek Parliament. The Psychargos plan, which is largely dependent on the Bill, will then be finalised.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission has approved a special action (which will be part of the PSYCHARGOS plan when this will be finalised) to be financed by the Operational Programme on Combating Exclusion from the Labour Market. This action includes therapeutic and training interventions for the rehabilitation of people with mental health problems residing in all psychiatric hospitals of the country; the creation and development of new extra‐mural structures for independent living and rehabilitation; reinforcing and broadening the training and employment opportunities of people with mental health problems and staffing and training of the staff of the new extra‐mural structures. The relevant activities are expected to be launched by the end of June 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Both during the application of Regulation 815/84 and in the current programming period the Commission has made, and plans to continue to make use of the expertise available in other Member States in the specific field. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 76 by <span class="bold">Lone Dybkjær </span>(H−0386/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Blue Flag Campaign – follow‐up to answer to H−0287/99</p>
<p class="contents">In question H−0287/99<a href="#def_1_9" name="ref_1_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> the Commission was asked whether organisations are able to ascertain how many complaints have been received and what they are about in cases where complaints are directed against themselves and are used as a justification for depriving them of financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether the Commission cannot or does not want to understand the question but the fact is that it has not answered it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that the identity of the complainant should be kept confidential but it is in fact the number and content of complaints that are of interest to those against whom complaints are lodged.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the FEEE is deprived of financial aid on the basis of complaints, can the FEEE be granted access to the number and content of such complaints and hence an opportunity to respond to them as long as the identity of the complainant is concealed?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided not to fund the 1999 Blue Flag campaign for both financial and technical reasons. First, the Commission had some questions concerning the administrative management of the subsidy. The FEEE did not provide requested documents justifying expenses on a timely basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Commission was concerned about the allegations of deficient control procedures by the national operators of the campaign during the bathing season, and in particular in case of complaints against FEEE on the handling of its scheme. Given these circumstances, the Commission did not grant financial support for the 1999 Blue Flag campaign under the ‘Call for the submission of proposals for general measures to inform and increase awareness of the environment'.</p>
<p class="contents">By letter of 17.2.1999, the FEEE was informed that there were three complaining letters at the moment containing allegations on Blue Flag Scheme (2 concerning Spain and 1 concerning the United Kingdom). As these letters had referred to the Bathing Water Directive<a href="#def_1_10" name="ref_1_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> , the Commission had registered them as complaints following the Commission rules. However, detailed assessment revealed that the letters did not raise issues of compliance with Community law but other aspects of Blue Flag Scheme, like deficient control procedures by FEEE national operators during the bathing season. As the cases did not raise issues of compliance with Community law, the Commission did not have powers to deal with these complaints and it invited the complainants to address their concerns directly to FEEE. If they did so, FEEE should be aware of the details of the allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has suggested to FEEE that in the case of complaints from the public, such as those mentioned above (concerning the handling of the scheme), the current response via the national operators should be complemented with some form of independent assessment, in order to ensure that the procedure is fair and impartial.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of the call for proposals in the field of environment (OJ No C 357, 21.11.1998, 98/357/07), FEEE submitted an application for funding for the year 2000 campaign. This proposal is currently under examination and FEEE, like the other applicants, will be informed of the outcomes of the selection by the end of May 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 78 by <span class="bold">Bernie Malone </span>(H−0394/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Restrictions on entry into Kings Inns legal courses</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of restrictions on entry to professional legal courses in Kings Inns, Dublin, which particularly affect holders of qualifications in other EU Member States, and if so, does the Commission consider that such restrictions are in accordance with EU law?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not aware of any restrictions on entry to professional legal courses at Kings Inn, Dublin, which particularly affect holders of qualifications obtained in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course willing to consider any documents and information which the honourable Member may wish to submit in connection with this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 79 by <span class="bold">Alex Smith </span>(H−0396/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Public health assessment from plutonium reprocessing</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission send a team of radiological experts on a special environmental protection mission to Scotland to assess the risks to the environment and the public health of the people of Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Scandinavian countries, including Member States Denmark, Sweden and Finland, arising from the nuclear operations at the reprocessing plants and plutonium stores at Dounreay and Sellafield, the ageing plutonium and tritium production reactor at Chapelcross in south‐west Scotland, the storage of depleted uranium at the same site, and the testing of depleted uranium shells at the Dundrennan test site in Kirkudbright, near Chapelcross; and will it include non‐governmental experts in the visiting mission?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has carried out verifications of facilities for monitoring radioactivity in the environment around the reprocessing plants at Dounreay (1993 and 1999) and Sellafield (1993). The other nuclear sites referred to have not yet been included in the programme of verifications due to resource constraints and the prioritisation of visits.</p>
<p class="contents">The teams carrying out verifications under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty do not include experts from non‐governmental organisations. It is the responsibility of the Commission staff comprising the team to ensure the thoroughness of the verifications and the objectivity of the findings. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 80 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−0398/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Recruitment policy and disabled people</p>
<p class="contents">What is the European Commission's policy in relation to recruitment of disabled people, including people with hearing difficulties? What equipment and facilities are available to disabled employees? What is the number of disabled people employed by the European Commission and what is the range of disabilities?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has adopted a Code of good conduct for the employment of people with disabilities (Ref. E/98/1874 – C(98) 2765, September 22, 1998) demonstrating its political will and commitment to promote equal opportunities for their employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of this code should ensure reasonable career prospects for those who are selected, buildings and/or working stations are adapted in order to respond to the needs of disabled persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Recruitment to Community institutions is done by open competitions. The Commission has tried for many years to avoid any discrimination in this field by giving special support to handicapped candidates for their participation in the different tests of each competition on an equal level with all other candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the number of disabled officials and servants is concerned, such statistics have been till now very difficult to obtain because of the sensitiveness and sometimes confidential character of this kind of data.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Code of Good Practice that each Institution will appoint an official or body to be responsible for the implementation of: </p>
<p class="contents">. the ‘census' of disabled persons working in the Commission, and<br />. centralising information in respect of the careers of disabled officials. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 81 by <span class="bold">Hans Lindqvist </span>(H−0401/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: MED‐TV</p>
<p class="contents">MED‐TV is a TV channel broadcasting from London which provides information about Mesopotamia. It can be seen by 40 million viewers and is aimed at Assyrians/Syrians, Kurds, Arabs and Turks throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 March this year, MED‐TV was closed down at the request of Turkey. At the same time, the official Turkish TV channels in Europe are allowed to broadcast heavily tendentious and heroising propaganda.</p>
<p class="contents">Official Turkey seems to have acquired jurisdiction and the right to act on European territory. European institutions have not shown integrity in dealing with Turkey's continuing demands to silence any voicing of opinions from minorities in exile.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions of people from Christian and Kurdish minorities have been forced to flee from persecution in Turkey. Many of them now live in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures will the Commission take to protect those living in the EU and uphold their right to balanced information and the re‐launching of MED‐TV?</p>
<p class="contents">Answer</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member has raised the issue of the closure of MED‐TV, a satellite channel licensed by the United Kingdom authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Community Law applicable in this area is the Television Without Frontiers Directive (Council Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). This directive lays down the legal framework for television broadcasting activities within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive provides that each Member State shall ensure that all television broadcasts transmitted by broadcasters under its jurisdiction comply with the rules of the system of law applicable to broadcasts intended for the public in that Member State. This obligation of ‘home country' control is the basis for granting ‘freedom of reception and retransmission' across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to the Commission, the Independent Television Commission, which is the licensing authority in the United Kingdom, revoked the licence of MED‐TV on 23 April 1999. This was pursuant to its duty to ensure compliance with United Kingdom Law. According to the United Kingdom authorities, the channel was in breach of its licence requirements, and also in breach of UK Law. In particular, the United Kingdom authorities have informed the Commission that MED‐TV broadcast programmes which encouraged acts of violence and which were likely to encourage or incite to crime or lead to disorder; the revocation of the licence followed a period of monitoring by the ITC which had issued a number of warnings to the channel that it was in breach of its licence requirements and the ITC code.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the United Kingdom authorities appear to have been executing their obligations under the Television Directive and thus under Community Law.</p>
