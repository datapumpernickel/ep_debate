An open declaration – I do not need to go into the details – means in the eyes of Parliament that the contents of the declaration must be laid out clearly and unambiguously on the table, so to speak. In 1979 it was turned into a disguised declaration and, since that time, the argument has run and run. It is running in Member States and has long been running here in Parliament and in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Right up to the time the Commission presented its proposal, the Commission services tried to make it clear to us that this was an open declaration. This assessment was finally reaffirmed in its own proposal. Parliament then approved this fine proposal after making a few improvements, calling for a positive list for example. Then it went to the Council, where a bit of wheeling and dealing went on, which resulted in a half-open declaration. That was only to be expected from the Council. What disappointed us was the fact that the Commission adapted its proposal, which was reasonable and urgently called for an open declaration, to suit the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I had been in contact with all the associations which were involved in this area: the cooperatives, especially the Association of the Compound Feedingstuffs Industry and the Rural Credit Association of Germany. All of them tried their hardest to explain that this open declaration would not in fact be permissible or implementable. This continued in the Council when the associations were unsuccessful in Parliament. The Council and, as has already been said, the Commission reacted to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have a situation where we have a disguised half-open declaration. Interestingly, the then Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany worked on this. He did not, however, issue a protocol stating that he, in fact, wanted the open declaration. When the BSE crisis hit, this Minister wrote to me saying that, as rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should make sure the open declaration was implemented with no ifs or buts. And that was the very Minister who had been in favour of the half-open declaration. A real lesson in political culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are faced with a different situation in Member States, especially in Germany, and once again we have a wave of excitement over BSE. Now, all those who before had their foot on the brakes are coming and telling us to implement the open declaration. This is now our task. My suggestion is that we stick with the original Commission proposal and our amendments. We, in this Parliament, will implement the open declaration. We will enter into negotiations with the Council and, if necessary, we will frustrate them in Parliament and put the blame on the Council if political groups do not get what they want.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioners – those of you who are involved in this – I guess you will just have to get used to the fact that this Parliament will endorse my recommendation. I hope we have you on our side and that, in your role as mediator, which you have to assume, you will support our position in the negotiations which must get under way with the Council, as we are now at the codecision procedure stage. We are on the right track. We want the open declaration with no ifs or buts and we also want the positive list. Mr Byrne, in our proposal for an amendment, we are giving the Commission a goal to aim for. Not immediately, we know this is not possible, but by the end of the year, we want at least a Commission proposal which will signal to us what direction it could go in. You see, we are prepared to make compromises here too.</p>

I would like to clarify the issue of so-called protein deficits. On 4 December last year, the Commission was invited by the Agriculture Council to analyse the situation of the market for protein-rich plants and to draw the appropriate conclusions from this analysis. At the time the invitation was extended, it was made clear that all Commission proposals had to move within the framework of the financial forecast agreed in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days later, the European Council in Nice defined the Commission obligation more precisely and called for a detailed analysis of supply and demand for oleaginous and protein crops to be carried out under strict compliance with the financial parameters agreed in Berlin. The Commission was happy to accept this invitation. It made a detailed investigation of the issues that had been raised and summarised its findings in a working document and in a Council communication to Parliament. What were these findings?</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, approximately 3 million tonnes of animal meal were produced in the European Union. Some 2 million tonnes were exported to third countries and a further half a million tonnes were used in the production of pet food. The remaining 2 million tonnes or so were used as pig swill and poultry feed. With the Council Decision of 4 December last year, the use of such feedingstuffs and such animal protein was banned for all agricultural livestock. As you know, until then they had only been banned for ruminants.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue here is to determine whether replacing the shortfall in animal meal by vegetable crops is a problem and, if not, how this should best be brought about. To be able to assess the changed demand for feedingstuffs we must first take a look at the development of meat consumption and meat production. The analysis contained in the working document is based on the assumption that the per-capita consumption of beef in the wake of the BSE crisis of 1996 will start to recover in the coming three to five years. This should mean an increase in both the consumption and production of pork and poultry meat. There are also two factors which determine the demand for feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, firstly, the lack of animal meal and, secondly, the expected rise in production.</p>
<p class="contents">To replace animal meal in feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry, primary consideration will be given to soya meal, then rapeseed and sunflower meal, peas, beans and sweet lupins. Cereals are also taken into account even though the protein content of cereals is relatively low. In practice the composition of feedingstuffs will be determined by the price and availability of raw materials and technical constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">The combined effect of all these variables is difficult to predict and it is even more difficult to isolate the changes brought about by the ban from normal market adjustments or the consequences of political measures. The current price ratio between cereals and soya will trigger three main reactions in the feedingstuffs industry and among farmers. Firstly, as prices for oilseed meal are relatively high in comparison with cereals, the proportion of protein-rich feedingstuff ingredients will be reduced to the physiologically requisite minimum. As a result, in comparison with previous years, especially 1998 and 1999 when soya prices were extremely low, the total quantity of raw protein in animal feed has fallen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proportion of cereals in animal feed should increase. Cereals are admittedly suppliers of energy rather than protein, but with an average protein content of 10% to 12%, the 5 million extra tonnes of cereals which will be fed to animals this year will supply half a million tonnes of raw protein.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the remaining gaps will be filled by additional imports of soya meal. In view of the slight drop in the total quantity used and the additional quantity resulting from cereals, there is expected to be a soya requirement in the order of one to one and a half million tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">What options have we examined to close these expected gaps? Firstly, we have looked into the possibility of increasing the aid quotient to EUR 74 per tonne, rather then keeping it at the same level as cereals, namely at a level of EUR 63 per tonne, as was decided in Agenda 2000. The disadvantage of this option is that it would re-introduce crop-specific aid for oilseeds and production would be subject to the upper ceiling set out in the Blair House agreement. Furthermore, if this option were chosen, around EUR 1 270 per tonne of soya meal equivalent more would have to be spent on additional subsidies, which is 6 times more in additional subsidies than soya currently costs. The budget costs for this option would amount to some EUR 475 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second option we have examined is to increase the aid quotient for peas, beans and sweet lupins by EUR 6. We opted for EUR 6 because such an increase would be covered by the peace clause in the WTO. Simulations have shown that, with the current price ratio between protein crops and cereals, this increase would only lead to a very small increase in cultivated areas. This would lead to extra expenditure, which would be higher than the price of any additionally imported soya, since the entire crop has to be paid for out of this increased subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have assessed the consequences the planting of protein-rich crops would have on set-aside land. If crops are sown on set-aside land which are then in competition on the market with cereals and oilseeds, this would result in the blue-box eligibility of land premiums in cereal production being called into question, quite apart from the fact that such a step would trigger severe international criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have examined the possibility of increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity for green meal and dried feedingstuffs together with a reduction in per-tonne guaranteed aid. As you all know, dried feedingstuffs are primarily used for ruminants and not for pigs and poultry, and our problem is primarily the keeping of pigs and poultry. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity by 10% would in fact lead to an increase in produced quantities, if we already have an estimated dried feedingstuffs surplus of 12% in the 2000/2001 financial year. The increase in guaranteed maximum quantities would most likely be used to cover existing surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, from an economic standpoint, there are no convincing reasons for introducing new support measures for protein production or for extending the scope of existing support measures. The availability of soya meal on the world market is not a problem. Quite the opposite, the extra quantities needed will increase current imports by just 3% to 5%. The expansion of soya production in South America and the USA will bring more soya meal onto the market than the European Union can use. What is more, the current budgetary plan does not allow for any leeway to implement the options we have assessed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, Commissioner, I think, and I am sure you know, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to give a clear signal with the Auroi report that promoting the planting of protein crops on set-aside lands would be given more support. I am convinced that Parliament will take this line.</p>
<p class="contents">Back, however, to the first issue. The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Herr Graefe zu Baringdorf, said that how the production of mixed feedingstuffs had evolved over the years had been an eye-opener. How different positions have been put forward at different times here in Parliament has also been an eye-opener. The path has not always been smooth, it has had its rough edges and there has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. I think, however, we are now on the right path towards showing even greater transparency and not only promoting it but implementing it as well. There have been hostilities and demands from industry against which Parliament and representatives in Parliament, with a clear majority, have always stood their ground. From the outset, Parliament has followed a clear line for more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Cards are being shuffled in the production of compound feedingstuffs and wherever cards are shuffled we need to be especially careful about whether we are actually dealing with a game of cards or the production of feedingstuffs. We have been careful to implement transparency more visibly than in the past, which is only right and proper. You are smiling, Commissioner Fischler. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf talked about a half-open declaration, which has been something special in recent years. I would like to say that it would have been more correct not to talk of a disguised but a half-disguised declaration. That may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and the positive list are necessary and would be a further improvement to the Commission proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take an example from another area of the food industry, and that is the purity regulations for beer.

This does not tally with the notion of comprehensive transparency in the production of feedingstuffs, which we have called for on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers do not yet know what and how many primary products are contained in feedingstuffs. That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the recommendation of the rapporteur, who systematically integrated the open declaration of feed materials in the text of the draft directive. He also repeated the demand for a legally binding positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. The Commission has been requested to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2001. This too has our full support. Surely it cannot be so very difficult to draw up a list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. At least we know what the various feedingstuffs should as a rule contain, or perhaps, after what has been said, we do not.</p>
<p class="contents">The eight months proposed by the rapporteur seem to me to be a reasonable and adequate time within which to draw up such a list. This list is urgent, since we cannot do without industrially produced feedingstuffs in the future. Just like people, animals need balanced nutrition. If they are only fed water, hay and cereals, which was called for in the past, this would not satisfy current conditions for agricultural production and is, in my opinion, a far cry from reality. Given that feedingstuffs are the most important part of meat production we must ensure that these feedingstuffs are safe. How else can we restore consumer confidence in meat.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the Council would be well advised to accept Parliament’s proposals without amending them and to demonstrate that it has learnt from past mistakes. We cannot wait until it is too late and then tinker about with the symptoms.</p>

It was unfortunate that they did that but, at that time and with the system we have in place, farmers were in no position to know exactly what they were giving their animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are discussing the food and feedingstuffs chain, we must ensure that the whole chain, from A to Z, is imbued with a number of concepts – transparency, information and public access to documents. We have inherited a chain with many links and with large gaps between each link and the next. That also applies to feedingstuffs. Whether their farms be large or small, ordinary farmers buying feedingstuffs cannot at present be reasonably expected to know what these contain. They have no laboratories available to them and, given the way feedingstuffs look nowadays, they can glean no information about the content from either the appearance, smell or taste. Farmers therefore need significantly more transparency and significantly more precise information. I think that this proposal is too complicated and that, in the long term, we ought to be able to find common principles for food and feedingstuffs which are somewhat simpler and somewhat more comprehensible both to the farmer and the final consumer of the food, for example a declaration of contents in descending order of volume and precise information upon request. As the situation at present stands and in view of the fact that we are now at the <span class="italic">beginning</span> of this food safety process, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will nonetheless be voting in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, we think that, although recently timid proposals have been made regarding the possibility of developing vegetable proteins, the Commission tends to insist that this is problematic on the basis of two arguments: the cost and agreements with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out the close links between cereals and protein crops. The budgetary impact of protein crops is derisory in comparison with that of cereals and, although the United States set out requirements for protein crops, this was in exchange for accepting the high level of support for export refunds on Community cereals. That is to say, protein crops also suffer from the consequences of balances of the CAP, and their cultivation could develop more if support for respective production was balanced out.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, there should be due evaluation of the benefits of pulses for biological diversity and reducing the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, and their positive effects on soil preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there are important reasons that we need to take into account: we are currently dependent on imports for 75% of our vegetable protein needs. This is an unacceptable strategic weakness and means that we must accept genetically modified organisms in our food.</p>

Clearly there is no wish to call into question the Blair House agreements, which reduce<span class="bold"> </span>the amount of Community land available. We are in an odd situation, on the one hand, the ban on the use of animal meal to feed production animals too has increased the requirement for plant protein; on the other hand, as of the next growing year, there is to be a sharp reduction in the amount of protein crops being grown. We feel that these crop productions must be guaranteed to protect the farmers and oilseed producers. The Commission needs to present a comprehensive report on the effect of the Agenda 2000 decisions on the management of the land dedicated to oilseed crops in the different production areas of the Community, and a proposal regulating the labelling of feedingstuffs containing GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that sufficient incentives must be provided for the production of plant proteins in the interests of the environment, of the meat consumer, who has to be able to trust the Community production chain, and of the oilseed production chain, which has made specialised investments and which is in danger of a sharp fall in employment. It is worrying that the Commission says it considers that it makes more economic sense to increase imports of soya meal. In this case, the economy is in open conflict with the interests of the Community agricultural sector and, in particular, with safeguarding the health and confidence of the citizen, which is not economically quantifiable. Yesterday, Parliament adopted an amendment which reads: “Health should not be considered as a commodity, which can be the subject of political or financial compromises”. Today, the Commission has told us that this is not so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, the European Parliament this week is not a million miles removed from the government of Rameses II, the pharaoh who, in antiquity, refused to let the Jewish people leave Egypt. I can imagine that, in the cabinet of that pharaoh, the plagues affecting the country were discussed on a daily basis, much like here in Strasbourg this week, where first foot-and-mouth disease was discussed, and now the effects of BSE are on this morning’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe is not holding a people against its will, but we cannot simply skim over the plagues which are hitting our agriculture. We need to take stock of our agricultural policy and reconsider the standards on which the policy is based. I have stated in the foot-and-mouth debate that animals, as God’s creatures, are more than production units. I repeat this statement in the light of the fact that we have fed herbivores, in other words plant eaters, their own species. We have turned them into cannibals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf was right to comment in his report that farmers are entitled to accurate information on the ingredients in cattle feed. The Council wants to leave the labelling to the feedingstuffs industry. Meanwhile, he suggests that farmers, upon request, are entitled to comprehensive information from the industry. That is completely ambiguous, if the farmer is entitled to comprehensive feedingstuffs information, it is only logical that this information should reach him without any obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">‘From stable to table’ is translated freely into Dutch as ‘from farmer to plate’. In that translation, the liability for the food process is emphatically placed with the farmer. In order to be able to bear that liability, the farmer must be able to avail himself – without any beating about the bush – of information on the cattle feed which he feeds his animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on the use of meat meal in cattle feed, which has been in place since December 2000, leads to a shortage in the protein supply in cattle feed. Alternatives for animal protein include soybean and other oilseed crops rich in protein. In the findings of research into alternatives, which Commissioner Fischler outlined here this morning, the recommendation is made that soybean should be imported from the global market. Other alternatives are being described as too expensive and leading to distortion. A real problem with the import of soybean is the fact that we have no insight into the production method. I very much doubt whether we are really better off if we feed our animals genetically modified soybean instead of meat meal.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis poses new dilemmas. The excuse that the European Union should not extend its acreage of oilseed crops due to WTO agreements is untenable. All the more reason for abandoning these WTO rules. I regret the ease with which the Commission rejects the growing of oilseed and protein-rich crops on fallow agricultural land. It is clear that the reason for leaving land untilled is in order to reduce the production of cereals, among other things. Less clear, however, is why the production of protein has to be reduced too in the light of an increase in demand on the European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last few months, with the BSE crisis and the ban on animal meal, it has been increasing at 300 000 tonnes a month.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does the Commission propose in the face of this? It proposes to take no particular initiative but to go to the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses and buy the proteins we need as cheaply as possible. Well, I can see at least three reasons for rejecting such a spirit of resignation and surrender. The first is that it puts food safety at risk. It is vital to strive for self-sufficiency in such an important product. The second lies in the environmental advantages of oil- and protein-rich plants: bio-diversity, crop rotation, nitrogen balance. The third is the need to respond to consumer demand for more traceability and visibility. And we have the means: support for bio-fuels, the safety net for oil-rich crops, supplementary aid for protein-rich crops, intensification of the public research effort and agri-environmental aid for farms which include leguminous fodder in their rotation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, those are the committed and responsible attitudes I would like to see the Commission taking, instead of restricting itself to recommending imports of cracked soya from America or Argentina on very short term commercial grounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That we need measures to overcome this crisis as quickly as possible is nothing new. Opinion is divided only on the question of which measures to take.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point is the ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs. This ban is necessary as we have a crisis of confidence on our hands. Mind you, we are not only dealing with a systemic crisis in the sector but with the need for confidence-building measures in favour of consumers. The ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs is a measure which will restore consumer confidence. There must also be a European protein plan to wean Europe off imports from third countries because these imports contain genetically modified soya. We must find a model which enables European farmers to react to these new requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel this complex problem is connected with the WTO. The Commission proposal, however, to allow organic farmers only to plant legumes does not go anywhere near far enough. I therefore support the line taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that planting can also be permitted on set-aside land of farmers who adopt environmental measures on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 1257/00.</p>
<p class="contents">If we talk of confidence-building measures, then we must stand up for an open declaration and for a positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. I believe that being honest with consumers can get us out of this crisis and take account of the dramatic situation of farmers and the threat to very many livelihoods. I am also hoping for support from the feedingstuffs industry to make an open declaration of feed materials. If such a statement truly reflects what is in feed materials, surely this cannot be a problem for the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s study is disappointing, as it is not very ambitious and is based on exclusively economic criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s situation with regard to its deficit of vegetable proteins, due to the Blair House agreements, in which we agreed to a reduction in our vegetable protein production while in the mean time we were feeding our livestock on meat meal from dead animals, required that the Commission take a more ambitious and broader approach to this study. It does not take into account, as has already been said, the strategic significance for European livestock breeding of being dependent on imports from third countries for the supply of vegetable proteins, and of the fact that those imports consist almost exclusively of genetically modified food. Nor does it take into account what it would mean to increase these crops that are rich in vegetable proteins in order to re-establish the balance and capacity to supply of the whole of the European Union, which would undoubtedly be very beneficial for achieving more extensive and better quality livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the study does not take into account any of the elements on which our agricultural policy should be based: food quality, protection and development of the environment and sustainable development, because neither is there any element in the study that tells us what an increase in these crops would mean in terms of creating another economic activity in agriculture, and in terms of the farmers themselves using them and processing them into food for their livestock, which would also mean a considerable increase in income in the rural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, what the Commission is telling us about it being better to continue importing and depending on third countries because it is cheaper is not correct. We have experience of the cheapest thing not being the best thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the point of view of producers, Parliament’s objective is to be supported. The more precise information there is on the content of feed the better. We must remember that this practice of declaration is not in itself important for the security of feedingstuffs. It is more important that all feed materials in compound feedingstuffs should be named in the declaration and that the feed materials meet with the requirements under the legislation on animal feedingstuffs. I think we should achieve a rational result quickly, as the new legislation is necessary. We must therefore move forward flexibly in the legislative conciliation process, bearing in mind that the second stage will be monitoring the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be expensive and in some ways impossible to start asking feedingstuffs manufacturers to ensure that each sack of feed should exactly correspond to the amount written on the declaration regarding percentages or that this should be monitored by the authorities. The most important aspect of this legislation is that we should invest in monitoring to a greater extent than is the case now. Safety will only be guaranteed if the acts are complied with. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the idea in Amendment No 4 of a positive list, there too it has to be borne in mind that it would be a very arduous task of administration if all feed materials used in EU countries had to be compiled in one list. There is already a list of prohibited materials in EC legislation and, in addition, there are general quality requirements for feed products.

My view is that the common position by the Commission is excellent. Let me just go back to what Mr Pesälä has just said: what is the real problem facing the food industry today? It is usually fraud. If we look back over the recent food scares, if we look at the problem of foot-and-mouth, it was a misuse of swill feeding; if we look at the problems of dioxin, there are sufficient measures there to prevent it. It was the illegal use of an oil in a mixture. Then there was sewage sludge which we had in one other Member State, and BSE which was all to do with changing temperatures. But the legislation is present. The first and primary position of this House is to guarantee that the Commission does everything it possibly can to ensure that the present legislation and the common position are put in place and enforced. Therefore, I call upon the Commission, first of all, to promise us that the present legislation is enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the protein situation, Commissioner Fischler would not be surprised to hear that I would slightly disagree with his position on whether or not we grow our own proteins or import them. But could he actually give me a guarantee: I understand that the European Union has regulations in place at the moment about the volume of GM crops allowed in and the percentage at present is – and I stand to be corrected on this – about 1% maximum of GM crops. Could the Commission now guarantee that none of the soya entering the Union in current and future imports will exceed the 1% maximum?</p>
<p class="contents">The US has strict measures and regulations on imports. We in the European Union must follow these regulations and ensure that we follow the same patterns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, Members of Parliament, today we have an opportunity to discuss another important food safety issue which is the labelling of compound feedingstuffs. I appreciate the work which has been done by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf who is very committed to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in question has its origins in the legitimate expectations and demands of both the farming community and consumers. This includes full transparency in giving livestock farmers details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs that they buy for their animals. One of the lessons of the dioxin crisis was that there was often a lack of such information. This is clearly not satisfactory. This information should be available, not only to ensure transparency but also to assist in the traceability of products. The labelling of compound feedingstuffs must be sufficiently accurate to allow the stock farmer to make an informed choice as to which feed to use and many of you have already made that point in your contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied that this objective is met in the Council's common position. While it falls short of the Commission's original proposal of full and precise listing of the quantities of all ingredients, it nonetheless strikes an acceptable compromise. In my opinion we have an excellent instrument for improving the existing labelling rules for animal feed. The common position provides for all ingredients to be precisely named and for the quantities to be expressed in five percentage bands. It also requires operators to notify the exact composition of the compound feedingstuff on the request of the stock farmer or any operator.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you that, from the very beginning, there were difficulties in the Council in reaching an agreement. A majority of Member States were opposed to the obligation to indicate on the label the precise composition of a given compound feedingstuff. For this reason, the Commission accepted the French presidency's compromise which had the unanimous support of all the Member States. I also consider that the common position provides us with a level of safety equivalent to that set out in the Commission's initial proposal. The most important fact is the presence of an ingredient in the compound feedingstuff and not necessarily its exact quantity. These exact quantities have a commercial value but they are not linked to health protection and that is the important issue in this consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to reconsider seriously what he said earlier in his contribution that if there is not a change in the Council position in relation to this, he will be happy to see his entire proposal fall rather than compromise on this particular issue. I believe I am correct in saying that the issue of public health and food safety is related to the presence rather than the quantity of what is contained in the compound feedingstuff. We should focus on that and not lose the benefit of this important piece of legislation. We risk pursuing a particular point to a degree of accuracy that is unnecessary and thus cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that if the amendments which the Commission cannot accept are adopted, we will embark on a long and difficult conciliation procedure which will postpone the improvement. I would also underline that the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading have been accepted in the common position except for the proposal that the Commission present a positive list of feed materials that may be used in animal feed. This is inappropriate in the context of the labelling directive. If you want a positive list, the first issue to be discussed is how to establish the criteria by which the positive list will be managed. I therefore intend to launch a feasibility study on the criteria which could be used for managing the positive list and the resources which this would involve. We can then report back to you, possibly with the proposal for legislation. I do not expect this to be possible within the timetable mentioned in the amendment. Unfortunately our resources and other priorities do not allow the Commission to set a more ambitious timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to amend slightly an answer I gave to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on the question of foot-and-mouth disease the other day and correct the record. The point he made was that the Commission had delayed in its response to the issues arising from the foot-and-mouth disease issue. I responded by saying that the Commission had been notified on 20 February of the outbreak in the United Kingdom and that we had put forward proposals to the Commission the following day and that in my view that indicated a prompt rather than a delayed response.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further piece of information that I should have added to this in fairness to the official working in my Directorate-General who by implication was criticised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. Mr van Goethem was told at 9.30 p.m. on 20 February and by 10.30 p.m. that night he had sent a fax to every single relevant minister in the Member States of the European Union. I want to add that particular piece of information to the answer I gave the other day which included the fact that, on the following day, the issue was brought before the Commission promptly. It may be an opportunity for Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to correct the suggestion he made about the delay, not for my sake but for the sake of the officials who work hard in my Directorate-General and who did an excellent job in this instance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank you all very much for your committed contributions but I must also remind you that the task the Commission took on was to investigate the impact the ban on bone and animal meal in feedingstuffs would have on supply and demand. It was not to examine the policy of oilseed production in the European Union. These are two separate issues. We must therefore separate the current additional protein deficit from the situation we already had in the Community. It is a fact that approximately 30 million tonnes of soya and soya equivalents are imported every year. It is not possible to make up for this deficit, at least using currently available options. There is one thing we must not forget: soya beans cannot be planted throughout the Community, but only in regions with a favourable climate. We cannot compensate for this on the basis of a policy of subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must remind you that the implementation of this policy is subject to the precondition that no distinction is made between promoting protein crops, cereals or other crops. This is simply not possible, unless we offer appropriate compensation. But what argument can we use to persuade the Americans to renounce the Blair House agreement if we have nothing to offer in return? Please tell me what we can offer to make the Americans agree to our introducing a specific subsidy for protein crops to enable us to produce more proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me back to the current protein deficit. The Commission is criticised for looking at things purely from an economic angle. I must ask Parliament whether it is justifiable to pay six times as much in additional subsidies for a kilo of extra soya production than a kilo of soya would cost on the market. There is no way round this issue, as we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to point out that the comments I have made here have nothing to do with the report we discussed yesterday evening. Naturally, the Commission will continue to ensure that organic farmers will still be able to plant clover and clover grass and other protein crops on their set-aside land as we proposed. I only mentioned that this morning because clover and clover grass have only been introduced to a limited extent in pigswill and poultry feed and are used primarily in feedingstuffs for ruminants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Byrne, thank you for your comment and your answer. Once again let me make myself clear. It was not my intention to criticise you personally or Mr van Goethem, whom I respect for his good work. What is at issue is whether the Commission worked out a disease plan in consultation with the Member States which made clear what had to happen if the disease broke out. My view is that not enough preparation was made. My comment was not aimed at individuals but rather at the Commission, as an institution, and at the Council, which did not do any preparatory work at all. This mess, which we had to go through in the public gaze, was scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">My criticism was also levelled at the culling strategy, which had not been properly thought out, and the fact that vaccination and vaccination plus assessment had not been incorporated into the strategy. This has now been conceded by the Commission, which is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, I would like to put another question to you. Assuming, hypothetically speaking, that we did not have this agreement with the Americans and that you were to calculate the cost of planting beans, peas, lupins and so on on set-aside land, would the economic calculation be entirely different? Am I right in thinking that it would? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are dealing exclusively with planting protein crops on set-aside land, then I have to point out that this is not covered by the Blair House agreement but comes under the WTO provisions. Accordingly, for a measure to come under the blue box arrangement, appropriate supply reduction measures would have to be adopted. Our supply reduction measure is set aside.
