<p class="contents">I believe that the rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have done a good job in achieving a fine balance between the various requirements at issue, and I therefore think that Parliament should approve the proposals adopted in committee by a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Two points now: the first, which is urgent, concerns the creation of the so-called single passport, designed to speed up and cut the cost of raising capital within the European Union. I believe that Mr Huhne’s framework, which the Committee has adopted, is something we can accept in its entirety. The second point concerns the chance given to the Member States to exempt companies with capitalisation below the EUR 350 million threshold from the obligations arising from the directive, as proposed by Mr Huhne. I believe this is a way of tempering the transparency of information with safeguards for the less small companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am also convinced by the arguments in favour of allowing the competent authority to be chosen by the issuer, as proposed by Mr Huhne. It is a mechanism that may prompt useful comparisons between the practices of the authorities in the Member States. In these cases, as always, the scaremongers talk of a race to the bottom or, in other words, a decline in quality. I believe that we should instead have more confidence in the ability of the markets to select and reward best practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So in Germany, for example, only ten charges have been brought, because the definition was not clear enough to justify time-consuming and costly legal proceedings. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously supports the comitology arrangements, reflecting the Lamfalussy report and its parliamentary counterpart, the von Wogau report.</p>
<p class="contents">We attached a great deal of importance to a new definition of insider information. This is information that is not generally accessible and which directly or indirectly concerns issuers of financial instruments. It is information which, if it became public knowledge via traditional or electronic media, could appreciably influence share values or prices. Manipulation is considered to exist in cases where false or misleading information on important facts is deliberately given and third parties stand to gain directly or indirectly. We managed to prevent special rules applying to journalists, who should not be treated any differently to anyone guilty of market manipulation. However, freedom of the press is guaranteed in each and every case.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted guidance for Member States on the enactment of sanctions and other measures. We have agreed on principles as proposals for the Commission, to enable it to exercise its implementation powers. We have drawn up a list of financial instruments to ensure that new products fall within the scope of the directive. And we have emphasised the importance of "Chinese Walls" as a preventive measure in combating market abuse, and have called for specific control of this in individual companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We agreed that a central authority should be set up or expanded in each EU Member State in order to exercise effective control. This is intended to bring together the various competences of national bodies so that they can closely cooperate with similarly structured authorities in other states. I regard the agreement between Parliament, Commission and Council on most of the proposals as a great success. Special thanks are also due to the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels; as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I wish to congratulate him on his ability to work out good compromises which incorporated many of our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The work done on revising the directive, which is also geared to new developments, should lead to greater coherence on Europe's financial markets and above all to more trust on the part of investors: the outlook is therefore good for a particularly sensitive area of our globalised economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are limits to our willingness to cooperate. I would like to repeat once again my group's objectives, which are market-oriented and user-friendly. The Directive on prospectuses should make the market easy to understand and make products transparent. We are in absolute agreement on that. Likewise, investors need serious information. Cases like Enron or Maxwell must not be allowed to happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear is that this directive cannot of course prevent fraudulent descriptions of securities, but this directive and all the accompanying measures that we have already dealt with and are already available should help to make sure that in future we are dealing chiefly with serious products.</p>
<p class="contents">My main criticism of the report before us, Mr Huhne, is that you as rapporteur have addressed only, or chiefly, big investors. However, the market is flourishing in the private sector, for small investors, and there are various quite different additional issues when it comes to SMEs. For example, for SMEs we of course need an attractive capital market and cheap equity borrowing, and our prime objective must be more security and quality for investors buying securities. Furthermore, it is absolutely vital that the scope of the obligation to publish a prospectus in Europe should be extended so as to achieve greater market transparency, and that is not yet included in the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, for the time being we have only been able to agree on a market capitalisation of EUR 350 million. I hope that there will be some additional flexibility on this in the package. Otherwise, with such a high threshold SMEs will be largely if not almost totally excluded, thus severely limiting the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Huhne, my group wishes to continue to play a constructive part in developing this directive, and I mean that very seriously. However, that will require greater flexibility on your part. That is ultimately what will determine how we vote on this issue and I hope I can give it my approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal is in many respects an invaluable step forward. However, closer examination and contact with the market participants have clearly revealed a number of problem areas in the original proposal that need amending. Within the limitations of my speaking time I can mention just the major necessary amendments we adopted in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The issuers must be given free powers of decision-making regarding which Member State’s stock exchanges or markets they wish to be listed on. There are many different types of securities for which there are no markets in some Member States. Certain market places have considerably more experience of these types of securities. It would therefore be better for EU issuers if in future they could, as is the case today, have their prospectus vetted by the competent authorities of the country where they are making the public offer or are admitted to trading, rather than in the Member State where they have their registered office.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies that wish to remain in their home country will obviously not benefit from this sort of single market and so will have no need for a securities prospectus of this kind. I therefore support the proposal that Member States could grant the right to make an exception in the case of those companies below a certain threshold seeking a listing in only one Member State. This would make the work of SMEs, in particular, easier, but would of course also offer them the opportunity, if they so wished, to acquire such a single market prospectus, thereby enjoying the advantages of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Translation costs have been a considerable problem and must be reduced to make it easier for companies to be listed abroad. Securities prospectuses are usually very long and contain a lot of detail. It is quite enough that the registration document should be drafted in the language that is customary in that sphere of finance and that just the Summary Note should be translated into the language of the host Member State. This is a clearer solution than the Commission’s original proposal and will benefit both issuers and investors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed mandatory annual ‘shelf registration’ system is also problematic. The system would enable companies which repeatedly return to the markets in several countries to raise capital without having to update the entire prospectus. This is of course a positive move. The approach is not appropriate, however, in the very common cases where finance is being sought just on one occasion or at intervals greater than one year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, and my other colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent and constructive cooperation. We achieved broad and balanced consensus regarding the necessary amendments. I hope that we can remain in agreement in tomorrow’s vote. Any deviation from the line of compromise achieved by the Committee would considerably hamper the creation of financial markets in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we can improve the text but I am afraid that Parliament will ruin it if it supports the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I hope that the vote tomorrow will enable us to make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in favour of the unification of the financial markets. It is essential if we wish to fulfil the objectives that we set ourselves in Lisbon. However, let us not forget what happened across the Atlantic. How can we fail to mention an affair that is still being talked about even now, the Enron affair, and fail to see that the lack of transparency and the lack of credibility of financial information were also among the reasons for this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can we fail to mention the number of start-ups that collapse day after day, even though almost as many are launched every day? We need a financial market that is open, accessible to all, mature, transparent, safe and sound, with no distortion of competition and with protection for all, which means access to cheap financial services for companies but also protection of savers, which means all savers, including small-time savers.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do that, I think that there are two fundamental principles that we need to restore in the text that we have received from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need a simple rule regarding the authority responsible for monitoring the prospectus, which is the rule of the country where the issuer has its headquarters. That is the basic rule in the whole structure of the internal market. Let us maintain it, we need it. We need a competent authority with a clearly defined role, with no possibility for delegation. These are three key elements as far as the regulatory authority is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the scope of application of the directive is concerned, there is the issue of SMEs. We need just as much information on SMEs as we do on large companies. It may be possible to make allowances by only requiring information from them on a yearly basis, but otherwise it is out of the question to exclude SMEs from the scope of the directive, as that would compromise the virtues of the European passport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, regarding conglomerates I would like to support a number of the amendments adopted in committee. The Commission proposal needs significant revision. In particular, the provisions on material holdings are unduly harsh and would unduly restrict banks and insurance companies in investing in a range of equities. That is particularly important in the context of insurance companies investing their pension funds money. This House has made it very clear that it wishes that investors be given access to a wide range of different equities. These provisions, as drafted, would make it almost impossible for an insurance company or bank to invest pension funds money in other financial institutions because of the harshness of the deductions. I hope, therefore, that the compromises proposed in Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48 will be adopted. I am not sure we have exactly the right answer yet, but it is clear that the material holdings provisions need to be altered.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Article 14 I hope that the Council and Commission will progress the discussions. I know they are having to streamline the administrative process related to conglomerates with third-country parents.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards prospectuses Parliament should follow the example set by the committee. The Commission's proposal applies a "one size fits all" framework designed for large equity issues to the diverse range of European financial markets. Parliament should amend the proposal in order to reflect the diversity of those markets. Shelf registration should be optional and not compulsory. Just because they use it in the American regulatory system, that does not mean we should adopt it here. As recent events have shown only too clearly, the American regulatory system is not always a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">We should exempt smaller businesses from part of the proposals, as proposed by the committee, and it is especially important that we recognise that there are particular concerns related to smaller businesses, particularly those which are only raising capital and doing business in one part of the European Union. We should retain the current regulatory framework for the professional bond markets. Where there are very sophisticated markets – indeed one of the most successfully integrated markets in the European Union – it makes no sense to apply protections designed for retail investors in equities. We need issuer choice, otherwise we will have the same problems we have had with the existing prospectus directive. That is essential if we are truly going to integrate the market for capital raising.</p>
<p class="contents">On market abuse the Commission's proposal has severe problems. I congratulate Mr Goebbels for tackling a number of them. I still have a number of concerns about the directive. There are significant problems with a directive that penalises wholly unintentional conduct, and I hope the Commission and Council will accept the safe harbours put forward by Mr Goebbels in the compromises, which are based on a safe harbour for acceptable market practice. This is particularly important in the context of derivatives, where the scope of the definition of inside information would make it very difficult to hedge ordinary liabilities, relating for example to an interruption to supply or new research revealing details of potential new supplies. If such information is instantly disclosable as "inside information" it would make hedging impossible and the derivatives markets would grind to a halt. I would also urge the Commission, Council and Parliament to look seriously at the amendments we have proposed on that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to recognise Chinese Walls where the proposal is being switched from a law which can be applied only to individuals to a law which can be applied to companies. It is very important that we encourage firms to take care to restrict the flow of inside information if at all possible, and I am very grateful to the rapporteur for responding to the concerns that I have expressed on this. Chinese Walls can be useful if they are enforced properly. We should encourage firms to use them and enforce them properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is vital that we have proper protection for freedom of speech and for journalists. Hence there need to be some radical changes to the proposals where they relate to the reporting of financial information by journalists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, we are proving in the European Parliament today that we have indeed made progress, and I believe the Commissioner will be pleased about that. I wish to focus on the report by Mr Lipietz. I would also like to congratulate him on his report on financial conglomerates. This is something in which we, in the Netherlands, have a great deal of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">But, I should like to make a few general observations in particular. We, in the Netherlands, have been struggling for some time with the issue of supervising dynamic developments within the market at both cross-border and cross-sector level. The problem is how to tailor this supervision to these dynamic developments. For the time being, the Financial Services Action Plan has settled for the approach of streamlining the rules of the different supervisory authorities in the Member States as much as possible, and working towards a level playing field within the markets on that basis. In this pragmatic approach, it is appropriate to leave it up to the Member States to decide on how they will organise their supervisory structure. I see this very much as an interim solution which also has some drawbacks. However, it is important in my view to focus on the future solution, future supervision, which will need to take place at European level. This structure will need to become more efficient, more transparent and less decentralised in order to be truly effective. It is impossible to regulate everything down to the last detail. In the Netherlands, we have a great deal of experience with an approach whereby the supervisory authority has a reasonable amount of discretionary power. However, this approach will cause problems if it has to be approved cross-border for other Member States, to cater for the large quantity of existing authorities. I therefore believe that we will have to hold a debate after all, about a strong, European supervisor, and we will also need to find out how we will distribute this task, and whether this will indeed be done at sector level. In my view, this comes too late, but we may ask whether we still nevertheless need to draw a functional distinction between supervision of conduct and prudential supervision. The role of the European Central Bank should also be considered in my view. I understand that in these circles, more thought is now also being given to a possible role in supervision. By way of conclusion, I should therefore like to propose that both the Commission and the European Parliament take initiatives for such a far-reaching discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this reconciliation has been achieved in the report on market abuse and also thanks to several compromise amendments in the Directive regulating the audit or control of financial conglomerates.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there are three attacks on the principle of legal protection in Mr Huhne’s report: firstly, an attack on the definition of the public offer; secondly, an attack on the choice of the authority designated to approve prospectuses; and thirdly, an attack on the obligation to inform small and medium-sized companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I will deal with each issue in turn. With regard to the definition of the public offer, the rapporteur proposes that this information should be provided to the investor at the final stage, immediately before the contract is signed. In my opinion, this information must be available and made public from the moment that money is requested from the investor and it is clear that my formula, which is in line with that of the Commission, does not exclude this investigation from analysing investment possibilities with professional investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the proposed free election of the supervisory authority, I, who in a former reincarnation was a tax inspector, do not feel it would be a good idea for contributors to elect their tax inspector, nor does it seem a good idea for the financial institutions to elect the ultimate supervisory body. I believe that the formula proposed by the Commission is more coherent and gives greater respect to the previous Directives, and shows a greater degree of common sense – that it is the national authority which has the best knowledge of the applicable national law, of which it should inform the investor – and that, above all, it presents the least risks, because the absolute freedom formula, in my opinion, opens up a competition, a race between the supervisory authorities to make things too easy and attract investors who would be a threat to legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree with the rapporteur on the last point with regard to the exclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises, even more so when we bear in mind that small and medium-sized enterprises have a capital of ESP 350 million, which would mean the exclusion of 80% of companies quoted on the stock exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that I am not able to finish; I will conclude this dialogue with Mr Huhne, now by letter and I hope, later on, orally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, this is a joint debate on three subjects. I should like to start with the report prepared by Mr Lipietz. I begin by commending him on that excellent report. He has mastered a proposal which is both technically complex and economically important.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore accept the following amendments without reservation: Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7 to 10; Amendment No 9 as corrected by Amendment No 50; Nos 18 to 30, 35, 36, 40 and 42. These are welcome reinforcements and real clarifications of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way there are a number of amendments which I can accept in spirit. They go a long way in the right direction but need some refinement to avoid confusion or possible contradiction. Amendment No 6 could be improved by combining the elements in Amendment No 9 to give a good set of macro-economic criteria to determine which groups are covered by the directive. Amendment No 17 clarifies how to cover special group structures. That is also a welcome clarification but the wording could be tightened up. Amendment No 31 requires the Commission to consult industry. I agree. But the amendment seems to us to be too limited. It restricts consultation to a handful of Brussels federations. The Commission is in favour of as wide and as representative a consultation as possible. I think that Parliament would also consider that necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 32 to 34, 44, 46 and 48 seek to amend what should be deducted from capital to prevent the so-called double-gearing of capital and artificially inflate a company's capital base. I agree with the spirit of those amendments. The 20% threshold for insurance deductions appears to be a good compromise. The proposed wording just needs some improvement to ensure the overall coherence of the text. But Amendments Nos 43, 45 and 47, which completely contradict Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48, are then not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are only a few amendments which I am unfortunately unable to accept. Firstly, amendments that significantly narrow the scope of the directive: namely Amendments Nos 4, 5, 11, 12 and 49. They will limit the measures to groups with a parent/subsidiary relationship only. That does not reflect reality. There are groups that are organised on a different basis which would then escape supervision, for example, horizontal cooperatives or mutual groups such as Rabo Bank in the Netherlands or the DG Bank in Germany. These amendments also exclude anyone with close links to a conglomerate. After the Spanish BANESTO case we all know how important it is to include such cases in our supervision, in particular for intra-group transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">A second group of amendments which I unfortunately cannot support concern the calculation of capital adequacy. They are Amendments Nos 15, 16, 37 and 39. I can accept moving the substance from the annex to the articles of the directive but I cannot support the additional substantive changes on the definition of capital. They would fundamentally undermine the capital standards for our industry. Firstly, the English text of Amendment No 16 changes one word in the original proposal and consequently opens the door to acceptance of all types of capital to cover risks, irrespective of the quality of that capital. I understand that this is a typing error – these things sometimes happen – but I should like confirmation that the French and German texts, which leave the original text unchanged, are the correct text. Secondly, I cannot accept including minority interests in group capital – that is, the last sentence of Amendment No 15 – if all the risks in the group are not also covered.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group of amendments which I cannot support are those that give our financial groups the freedom to choose the way in which they calculate their capital adequacy. This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 13, 14, 38 and 51. That is the role and responsibility of our public authorities. They cannot abdicate this to the industry through self-regulation, and I agree that the authorities should discuss and agree with each group how its capital adequacy should be calculated. I am sure that we can work out an acceptable compromise, but I ask for your understanding if I say that these amendments go too far.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion on this point, this is a most welcome and supportive report. I should like to underline that. With a few exceptions which I have mentioned, it really contributes to a rapid agreement and I am confident that it will be possible to work out acceptable compromises on the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 11 to 16, 37 to 39, 49 and 51. Progress is being made in the Council and agreement between the institutions appears quite close.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue, which is the report prepared by Mr Goebbels, may I begin by saying that very good progress has been made on this dossier. First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, very much indeed for all the efforts he has made while working under heavy pressure, as we all do, incidentally. It is a very complex and sensitive dossier and I should like to applaud the fact that the rapporteur has resolutely defended the aim of this directive, namely to enhance substantially the integrity of European financial markets. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Monetary Affairs for their readiness to proceed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I know we all agree that the European Union has no truck with greedy financial cheats. We want stable, transparent, integrated and efficient European markets for all consumers and investors. This directive must contribute to increasing investor protection and to making European financial markets surer and more attractive in future. It must dispel the international concerns expressed over the last few years about insider dealing and manipulation on European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certain all Members are aware that recent events have shown how important those issues are. It is not only the attacks of 11 September that have proven the necessity of high market protection. Scandals such as the Enron business, which has been referred to at various times tonight, clearly show the need for rules making markets safer and ensuring that they remain free of abuse and fraud. The smooth functioning of financial markets and public confidence in them are the conditions for sustained economic growth and wealth. Market abuse increases the costs for financing companies, harms market integrity and dissuades investors. We must do everything to stamp it out. With this directive, we ensure high market integrity, and establish common standards against market abuse throughout Europe, making European financial markets more attractive in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree with all the amendments that Mr Goebbels has proposed in his report, except those additionally proposed by Mrs Echerer, Amendments Nos 75 and 76, by Mr Lehne, Amendments Nos 88 and 89, and by Mr Herzog, Amendment No 87.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Commission still has doubts about Amendment No 2 regarding comitology. Firstly, this amendment is not necessary, given that the Commission has already accepted Amendment No 1, which makes a clear reference to the declaration of President Prodi at the last part-session of this Parliament on 5 February and to my letter of 2 October 2001 to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath. Furthermore, during the debate on the report by Lord Inglewood concerning international accounting standards last Monday, I once again underlined our full commitment to this important declaration regarding the implementation of financial services legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the amendment does not reflect all the elements that have been agreed between our institutions, and there are some differences between the wording of the declaration of President Prodi and the wording of Amendment No 2 which might result in misinterpretations. Furthermore – and this is an important point – I would say to Mr Goebbels that I am not certain whether the different wordings would be agreed by the Council. I cannot speak on behalf of the Council, but it may well entail difficulties which we would be well advised to avoid. The Commission would prefer, therefore, to stick to what has previously been agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me state unequivocally that the Commission will fully respect – and to the letter – the commitments it has made in its declaration in plenary, as well as in my own letter to Mrs Randzio-Plath. Should plenary adopt the amendments adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, together with some of the additional amendments proposed for today's sitting, I very much hope that the Council will be able to accept this text as well, so we would have only one reading. That would be a major achievement for the integration of European financial markets by the year 2005 to which we all aspire, as well as a sign of confidence for the Barcelona European Council. I hope that all Members present here and those voting tomorrow will agree and adopt that directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we come to the report prepared by Mr Huhne concerning the directive on prospectuses. May I again begin by thanking Mr Huhne for his report. Many amendments have been proposed and they result in clarification of our proposal. Good work has been done to improve the wording on eurobonds, which we broadly support. We can accept 46 amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 7 to 9, 13, 18, 19, 22 to 26, 29, 30, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44 to 56, 58 to 61, 63, 64, 66 to 72 and 75, but we may have to redraft some of them to ensure the overall coherence of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">I am worried, however, by some points which Parliament may adopt. Firstly, I am concerned that, in the aftermath of Enron, Parliament may even weaken the fundamentals of current EU legislation, i.e. legislation which is now in force, namely, that companies wanting to raise capital among the public have to disclose information in a prospectus approved by the competent authority. That is what Amendment No 35 is about. Is this Parliament really prepared to support an amendment to the effect that more than 75% of all companies listed in Europe should be able to raise capital without publishing a prospectus? Mrs Berès made that same point a little while ago. That would mean that for some EU markets all but one or two companies would be exempted. How do we explain that to European investors?</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, the prospectus proposal has two aims: to facilitate fundraising for European issuers, and to ensure an adequate level of investor protection. Both these aims are equally important. Investor protection has been neglected too often in the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second cause for worry is that some of the amendments proposed will result in more fragmentation, not less. We must agree what is good for the EU as a whole, and we do not want any tinkering with national systems. Let me be clear on this point, and let me be clear to this House, that my colleagues and I will spare no effort to reach an agreement with Parliament on this crucial text for a single capital market, but we must resolve those problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now briefly address possible solutions to some of the most important political issues. On small and medium-sized enterprises the Commission is against their total exemption from the proposal, but it is willing to find a cost-effective solution that would ensure that SMEs should have access to capital markets at the right price and under the right levels of regulation with the necessary investor protection. We have always advocated adapting the disclosure rules to the specific nature of SMEs and we would be ready to contemplate an exemption for SMEs from the obligation annually to update the prospectus, as proposed by Amendment No 71.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards eurobonds we agree with the rapporteur's idea to exempt eurobonds with a high minimum denomination but we consider that the level proposed – EUR 50,000 – is too low. We therefore support Amendments Nos 66 and 67, as it seems to the Commission that good work has been done here.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the annual updating of the prospectus, we might contemplate exempting SMEs but we shall certainly stay firm as regards big companies, not least because 300 of our largest companies listed in the United States already comply with this obligation. Our investors should have the same disclosure as United States investors. I am certain we all agree that our investors are not inferior to the American ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, regarding the competent authority, we want to retain our position of one administrative authority per Member State. We are ready to clarify that a delegation of powers is possible provided that the ultimate responsibility remains with the single administrative competent authority. We do not agree with the free choice of the regulator which might lead to the famous "race to the bottom", but we would be ready to consider some flexibility for issuers of debt securities and those working out of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission rejects 29 amendments. They are Amendments Nos 2, 5, 6, 10 to 12, 14 to 17, 20, 21, 27, 28, 31 to 37, 40, 42, 57, 62, 65, 73, 74 and 76. Regarding Amendment No 10, we accept the amendments on comitology because they reflect our agreement on that matter, but we consider that Amendment No 10 is redundant. The situation is the same as for Amendment No 2, on the report by Mr Goebbels, so I do not have to repeat the whole argument. We consider Amendment No 10 to be redundant given Amendment No 1, which refers to the resolution of Parliament and my letter to Mrs Randzio-Plath. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
