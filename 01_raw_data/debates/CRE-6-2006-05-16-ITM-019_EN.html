<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pervenche Berès (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament attaches a great deal of importance to the issue of the democratic control of the European Central Bank. On behalf of all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I imagine, but also on behalf of the Commissioner, I should like, if I may, simply to deplore the fact that this debate is being held at such a late hour. If we want the issue of monetary dialogue to be taken seriously, then it seems to us that a decision as important as the replacement of a member of the Executive Board should not be taken at such a late hour. All the more so given that, for us, it is a question today of defining our position on the issue referred to us by the Council concerning the last replacement of a member that has sat on the Executive Board of the Central Bank since the outset and of the last appointment that will be made before 2010. This appointment is therefore important with regard to the content of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I must point out in this House that, following a vote within the ECOFIN Council, the candidate put forward by that body, whose appointment must be validated by the European Council, required a majority vote in order to be presented as the candidate supported by our Parliament. In that consultation procedure, the profile expected of the candidate is one of possessing the necessary authority and professional experience in the finance or banking sector. Those are the terms of the Treaty. The candidate proposed to us clearly meets those criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue that was, in fact, very much the driving force behind the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was a certain anxiety with regard to the circumstances in which the debate was conducted in the Council. At a time when everyone acknowledges that monetary policy is an independent policy, when the political power does not have much to say and when practically all of the members of Eurogroup and ECOFIN have criticised the monetary policy when it came to raising interest rates, this appointment has not been the subject of any debate whatsoever. That is why, at the same time as assessing this candidature, we sent a letter to the President of ECOFIN, Mr Karl-Heinz Grasser, the main points of which I should like to go over in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We looked into the selection procedure of members of the Executive Board and we therefore question the Council on two aspects of that procedure. The first concerns the system of rotation of membership on the basis of nationality. I, for my part, understand that the main economies of the eurozone must be represented on the Executive Board, but that opinion is not shared by all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In any case, the issue of how members of the eurozone are represented on the Executive Board was raised by members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, while that of the size of the Executive Board was not, for its part, mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the issue of the diversity of backgrounds represented on the Executive Board was also a matter of concern for the members of our committee, based on this idea that we perhaps need people within the Executive Board of the Central Bank who come from different backgrounds so that, when the monetary policy of the entire eurozone is at stake, all of the different points of view can be expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee felt that, in the long run, the Council should be able to hold a genuine and open debate, with guidelines, on the profile that should be proposed by the Member State, which would have the opportunity to appoint a member by respecting the diversity of the member countries of the eurozone. We believe that the European Parliament should have the right to a vote of approval, as the members of the Commission do.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the spirit in which we composed this letter to the President of ECOFIN. I believe that all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with the entire institution behind them, are open to dialogue with the Council, thanks to which we will have a better and totally satisfactory procedure in 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was involved in the creation of the framework conditions for the euro as State Secretary of the German Ministry of Finance and is, so to speak, one of the founding fathers of the euro. Furthermore, something revealed by the hearing that is very positive is that he is a committed European. That should also be mentioned at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">He stands for continuity in the European Central Bank, and for the objective of independence, which is particularly important at a time when increasing attempts are being made to subject the European Central Bank to external requirements. He stands for a low rate of inflation, for a stable currency, for the Stability and Growth Pact – which is very important at this particular time, when Member States are finding it hard to make savings.</p>
<p class="contents">With the enlargement of the euro area around the corner, continuity is the overriding consideration. Speaking of the enlargement of the euro area, I should like to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats warmly welcomes Commissioner Almunia’s decision today in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of Parliament’s role has also been debated. I, too, should like to see a strengthening of Parliament, and wish to emphasise that Mr Stark stated explicitly that the role of Parliament is very important to him. I hope that, in future, he will intervene accordingly on the Executive Board of the ECB when the CESR external expert group on clearing and settlement is engaged again, as it was just recently: we shall be looking at whether he really gives Parliament top priority. That was just an aside.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that should play no part in Parliament in future, however, is screening of fundamental attitudes, and that is why we should think carefully about how to do things in future. What we need are candidates with a good image, with the relevant experience, like Mr Stark. It must not be a case of who shares our personal political views and who does not. That is not Parliament’s job, and I would not follow this course. I support the objective of ensuring that there are no national fiefdoms in the European Central Bank. We must also ensure, however, that both large and small economies are equally represented on the Executive Board of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish Mr Stark very great success with his new job, which we hope he will take up – for the sake of the euro and Europe, and an appropriate, effective, significant portfolio in the Governing Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Diversity in educational backgrounds, work experience, age, gender and nationalities guarantees more sensitive, alert and creative cooperation than just adding more of the same sort of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Replacing one Bundesbanker with another does not promise much diversity and creativity. If it had been a company operating in a fast-changing environment, I would have advised the ECB, when it was drawing up a profile for a new board member, to look at this aspect of diversity. But the ECB is not a company and its policy is kept static; it is apparently deemed that it should eternally remain as it was at its creation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not hide my criticism of this lack of dynamism in the development of monetary policy, although I agree that it is not only the ECB that should be addressed but also the political decision-makers, the Ecofin Council and the governments of Member States, which nowadays do not seem to be very inspired by macroeconomic coordination at European level that complements their common monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But in this debate tonight we are not dealing with the policies of the ECB and the eurozone as such, but with the appointment of a new Bundesbanker to the Executive Board. The strict remit of our ECON Committee is to assess the capabilities and competences of the nominated candidates and we do not have much to say in this debate, because the candidate meets the criteria and performed well in the hearing that we had with him.</p>
<p class="contents">In my political group, the PSE, we are more interested in discussing the procedure leading to this appointment. Originally we proposed to do that in the report that we are dealing with now and we were disappointed that a majority of the committee did not support it. That was why we abstained in the vote. In the coordinators’ meeting following that committee meeting, we jointly agreed to write a letter to Mr Grasser, as well as starting a more fundamental debate about the nomination procedure, particularly the upgrading and reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in such nomination procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for the European Parliament to counterbalance what I see as a strong renationalisation and non-integrationist trend in the way Member States deal with these issues. It is clear where our criticisms are focused: there is apparent evidence that large Member States have ‘reserved seats’. There is a lack of debate about profile and portfolios and this diversity of backgrounds, and a lack of choice. The issue of appointment is taken as an ‘A’ item in the Council debate and the European Parliament has a very limited role.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that if we have the opportunity to present more proposals, the Commission, the Council and the ECB will ready to discuss with us a change in this appointment procedure. But we hope to cooperate very well with any candidate put forward by Mr Radwan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report presented by Mrs Berès clearly expresses this positive assessment, and therefore has the support of our group. Mr Stark gave convincing written answers to the questionnaire presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. At his hearing in committee on 18 April, he then proved himself once more to be an excellent candidate for membership of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">He is convincing on account not only of his personal integrity, but also of his wide-ranging experience and his competence, particularly in matters of monetary policy. He played a substantial role in shaping the process of monetary union from 1988 until the introduction of euro notes and coins in 2002. Thus, he ranks among the architects of the Stability and Growth Pact, and he has spoken out consistently and clearly against watering it down.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcome the fact that Mr Stark is a well-known advocate of the independence of the European Central Bank and attaches the highest priority to price stability. He has declared his unequivocal belief in the cornerstones of monetary union, and as a result we can be sure that he will endeavour, as a European, to act for the benefit of all. In addition, Mr Stark has given assurances that he is prepared to engage in an open dialogue with Parliament. We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs shall take him at his word.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with a few critical remarks, which are of an exclusively procedural nature and have nothing to do with the quality of Professor Stark’s candidacy or with him personally. Although all the previous speakers have already pointed this out, I consider it sufficiently important to emphasise it once more: this nomination is not the result of a competitive process in which several applicants present their candidacies, but of political deliberations on the part of the Council. In addition, the large euro countries appear to look on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank as a fiefdom and exclude the representatives of other Member States from the outset. The Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Berès, has written a letter to the Austrian Council Presidency proposing procedural improvements, as she has just stated. The ALDE Group expressly supports this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are assessing the candidate himself, and, in Mr Stark, the Council has put forward a strong candidate to succeed Mr Issing. I should like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Executive Board Member Mr Issing once again for his work and constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stark represents a strong signal for the Stability and Growth Pact, for the Maastricht criteria, for the independence of the ECB, for a strong euro and for continuity and calculability – and continuity and calculability are preconditions for confidence. We need not only greater confidence in the EU, but also great confidence in the independence of the ECB and in the euro as a strong currency. For that reason, I ask all my fellow Members to demonstrate our great confidence in Mr Stark tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask that we refrain from sacrificing these facts, which are also set out in the report – committed European, competent expert, champion of the value of independence, advocate of prioritising price stability, firm conviction in monetary policy, openness with regard to the rights of Parliament, and commitment to stepping up the dialogue between the two institutions – to party political small-mindedness, because this attitude has no place in either the EU or the European Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
