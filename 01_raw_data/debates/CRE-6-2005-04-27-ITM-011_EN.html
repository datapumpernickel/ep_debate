The Agency’s mission is to improve people’s working lives and to foster the exchange of technical, scientific and economic information between all parties affected by issues relating to safety and health at work, whether these be Community bodies, Member States, employees, employers or safety engineers.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the Commission set out its proposals for amendments to the regulation establishing the Bilbao Agency, with the aim of responding to the needs of an enlarged European Union and streamlining the way in which the 78-member tripartite Administrative Board works. The new regulation formalises the role of the Bureau, as well as maintaining and strengthening the tripartite structure of the Administrative Board, which is made up of Commission representatives and representatives from the governments, from the Member States and from employer and employee organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal also reinforces the role of the social partners and strengthens the links between the Agency’s mission and the objectives of the Community strategy on health and safety at work, as well as underlining the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has proposed a number of amendments aimed at making the original proposal clearer and more precise, and has also put forward certain amendments proposed by the Council. The fact that amendments have been proposed to the way in which appointments are made to the Bilbao Agency did however come as something of a surprise to the Commission, as the implication is that the Commission should have closer control over the Agency. Ever since the latter was established, its Director has been appointed by the Administrative Board, on the basis of a recommendation from the Commission. Given that this is the procedure currently followed by the majority of agencies, it would be a pity if it were to be changed. I should like to thank the House for having given the draft regulation such a positive reception, and for the new provisions it has proposed with the aim of making it clearer and more precise. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stephen Hughes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, it is significant to me that tomorrow, the day we will vote on this report, is International Workers’ Memorial Day. That is the day that commemorates the 60 000 workers per year who die globally from job-related injuries or illnesses and the many millions more who are injured. For the European Union 15, the figures have been steadily improving over the last decade, but there is still nothing to be proud of. Some 4 500 workers die each year as a result of accidents at work and many more from work-related illnesses. Over four million still suffer significant injuries at work each year. This is the important backdrop to our debate today on the Bilbao Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the figures for the EU 15 have improved over the last decade and I am convinced that the key health and safety directives that we have put in place, and the work of the Bilbao Agency itself, have made an important contribution to that improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has said, we are discussing the review and updating of the regulation governing the operations of the Bilbao Agency. That review was called for in the original regulation. It is a little later than it might have been, but that is because there has been a full external evaluation and a full consultation of all stakeholders, which has informed the Commission’s proposal and indeed the recommendations from the Council. As the Commissioner has also said, the other imperative for change has been the enlargement of the European Union, which has meant an increase in the Board of the Agency from 48 to 78 and has therefore necessitated a streamlining of administrative and management processes.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that we have proposed fall into four main categories. The first are intended to clarify the objectives and tasks of the Agency, improving the link with the priorities of the Community strategy, strengthening the Agency’s capacity for data analysis, focusing more on the needs of SMEs and providing accessible and comprehensible information to final users.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are amendments intended to take account of the enlargement of the Union, clarify and improve the functioning of the Governing Board and strengthen its strategic role and the executive role of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are those intended to reinforce the role of the social partners in the Agency’s network in the Member States – a very important point – and those intended to reinforce cooperation with other Community bodies in the social policy area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also, of course, tabled amendments to try to ensure a proper gender balance in the management structures of the Agency. I shall pick out one or two of the more important ones. First, I would like to say that I am grateful to Giovanni Berlinguer and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an excellent opinion. I have taken up a number of their suggested amendments, for example Amendment 2, which underlines the need for the Agency not only to collect and disseminate information, but also to analyse that information, identify risks and good practices, and promote preventive action. It also underlines the role of the Agency as a risk observatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 4 concerns gender balance and the governing and management structures of the Agency. Amendments 5, 6, 7 and 8 concern in different ways the added value the Agency should bring to the data it collects and collates through analysis, evaluation, identification of best practice and dissemination of that information and best practice to where it is most needed, particularly with small and medium-sized enterprises. Amendment 7 also underlines the need for the promotion of the harmonisation of statistics on work-related accidents and illnesses, a crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of amendments then look at a number of technical and administrative matters concerning the composition of the board and Bureau and their respective roles and responsibilities, and the interrelationships between the two bodies. We think these amendments will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point is the one the Commissioner mentioned. That is Amendment 23, dealing with the appointment of the director. I know the Commission is not happy with it, but it reflects the procedure followed by the other agencies in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ remit. The Commissioner has also intervened recently in the appointment of directors at certain agencies. Therefore maybe the amendment better reflects current reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the report seeks to strengthen the role and function of the Agency, which has already done excellent work. I commend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has cited some figures, but the reality is that a large number of work-related accidents and illnesses are preventable and that they particularly affect the most vulnerable people: immigrants, temporary workers, illegal workers and the unskilled. Furthermore, they affect people that receive less protection from trade unions, which do not reach large numbers of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that there is some danger of the situation worsening, as a result of the political options presented to the European Union. If competition between countries, rather than encouraging safety and innovation, meant a relaxation of safety measures and an increase in working hours, that would increase the number of accidents and illnesses. If the Bolkestein Directive on services brought in social dumping by means of the country of origin rule, the number of accidents and illnesses would be compounded.</p>
<p class="contents">There are important amendments in Mr Hughes’s proposal, above all the involvement of the social partners, that is to say the workers themselves, who are, on the one hand, the victims, and on the other, the proponents of safety and health in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a new MEP and a representative of a new Member State, I find the very existence of the Bilbao Agency a matter for concern. I have yet to be fully convinced that there is any genuine and legitimate need for a separate EU body dedicated to the matter of health and safety at work, given that this is such a narrow, albeit important, field.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue to review the arguments that speak in favour of the existence of this institution, as well as any that suggest that it would be preferable for problems relating to health and safety at work to be tackled in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, or in other words at national level alone.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand, however, both the motion for a resolution that has been tabled and the rapporteur’s report serve to make the Agency’s work more transparent, and I can therefore endorse the motion for a resolution drafted by the rapporteur.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marian Harkin, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I welcome the report on the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work and I congratulate the rapporteur on work well done.</p>
<p class="contents">The key elements of this Agency are its research and distribution of best practice to Member States in relation to standards concerning health and safety at work. Legislation governing the health and safety of workers throughout the EU is a prime example of how the EU has made and can make a positive contribution to raising the quality of life for millions of the Union’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">But legislation is just one part of the equation; enforcing that legislation is another. Health and safety in the workplace can only be maintained where adequate monitoring is conducted at workplace level. While I am not familiar with the situation in other European countries, I know that in Ireland we do not have an adequate number of inspectors and monitors to ensure the health and safety of our own workers. A notable case in Ireland recently has been the exposure of the Turkish multinational company Gama, which has deprived workers of earnings through paying substantially below the minimum wage and endangered their health and safety by requiring a substantial number of its workers to work up to 80 hours per week. This is extremely damaging to the health and safety of those workers. In the potentially dangerous construction industry, accidents are much more likely to occur when people are required to work such long hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is not just the company that has a responsibility. We have the legislation in Ireland, we have the minimum wage, but we are not properly enforcing that legislation. This is a high-profile case in Ireland at the moment, but there have been a number of cases in recent times where workers’ rights, particularly immigrant workers’ rights, have been trampled on.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is currently applying for membership of the EU and I support that move, but part of that process will have to be a requirement that major companies like Gama respect and protect workers’ rights within the EU. I believe the onus is on the Turkish Government to ensure this happens.</p>
<p class="contents">So, while we welcome this excellent report today, and indeed commend the work of the Agency, we all need to be vigilant in our own countries to ensure that workers’ rights are upheld. In particular, we need to be vigilant where workers are exposed to dangers and to risks and where they are less well represented by trade unions. What we are talking about here are immigrant workers, under-age workers, temporary workers, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to make a comment on Amendment 7, which underlines the need for reliable information and comparative data and the need for a systematic collection of data across the Member States in the field of health and safety at work, with the support of Eurostat. We need accurate information across all 25 Member States, collected in a uniform way, so that we have good-quality, reliable and relevant information to underpin all policy decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is right behind this report, and I wish to express my appreciation to Mr Hughes for drafting it. We see it as very important that the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao should, as far as possible, enjoy the same legal status as the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Thessaloniki, and that it should be equipped with a constantly improving range of instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe needs these agencies’ input more than ever, for it is often apparent that two of Europe’s three pillars – the social and the environmental – are threatening to give way. Other speakers have already mentioned such things as the Bolkestein directive and REACH, and I realise how unstable a pillar social Europe rests upon when I hear employers heaping derision on the prospect of a directive on protection against optical radiation, which would lay down minimum standards for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety at work, the prevention of accidents and preventive health care must be treated as matters of high importance if workers are to be more than factors in capitalists’ production calculations. Fine-sounding declarations of principle are not enough; what is needed is research and instruments, developed by this agency in order that standards may be arrived at and legal measures drawn up, and in order that it may be possible to monitor whether the rules we lay down are actually adhered to. We in the Group of the Greens therefore expect the agency in Bilbao to be allocated the resources that it needs in order to do its job efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to mention the fact that the administrative board finds itself overburdened with the administration to the point that it cannot concentrate on strategic planning. This is a pity, because I would like it to strategically plan so as to be able to look at the workers that are not included in the Agency’s vigilance for health and safety. I refer to these as ‘home carers’, and will continue to do so for the rest of my time here. They make up the largest workforce in Europe; they often lift beyond their weight and work around the clock, year in and year out. There is nobody monitoring their health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It can sometimes be quite ludicrous: as a home carer myself, for a short period of time I had someone sent in by the state to give me a few hours’ help a week. This helper could not lift, could not put his hand above his head, could not in fact do anything that a carer had to do. I had to let him go because there was no help he could give, all on the basis of health and safety. I, however, could do anything, no matter how dangerous, because I was a home carer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid I ran out of my office with the wrong file under my arm and had to go back for the correct one. It happens to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to refer to Mr Mote’s comments: he might be a bit more sanguine about the health and safety regulations if he had once had to gather up the remains of an unfortunate worker who had slipped off a roof and ended up dead on the street below because there was no scaffolding available during his work, and had then to go to the family of that unfortunate man and explain why he was dead. There is nothing in the health and safety regulations that is an undue burden on business. After all, the human cost of the deaths on building sites – which are quite appalling – and the injuries – which are also quite appalling – cannot be measured by the inconvenience of having to put up a bit of scaffolding.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address two points here. First and foremost I should like to thank Stephen Hughes for his report and indeed for seeking to raise the whole issue of gender balance in the boards of the Health and Safety Authority. I would also briefly like to mention Mrs Harkin’s European Foundation report, which unfortunately is not being debated in the House, but is being voted on tomorrow as well. That dealt with perhaps a much more complex problem because of the staffing situation there – it being a much older foundation. The Commission and the Council sought to change the status of the workers in that Foundation and we had to negotiate considerably to try and find a solution to that.</p>
<p class="contents">While this Parliament is only consulted on this issue, I believe we have found good common ground between the staff of the Foundation, the management and indeed the Parliament here. I know that the Irish presidency initiated discussions on this during its time in office and it helped to encourage the Luxembourg presidency to take on board the recommendations that this Parliament is making. I hope that the report is adopted without difficulty here tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although we have undoubtedly made progress in this area, there can be no question of us ever ceasing in our efforts. The incidence of work-related accidents has fallen by 13%, yet the figure is still too high, and certain jobs are still unduly dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Bilbao Agency has received an overwhelmingly positive assessment, as this is a view I share.
