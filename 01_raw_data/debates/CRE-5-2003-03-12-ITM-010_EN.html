<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I hope you feel as comfortable in this intimate circle at this time of day as I do, and you of course know why we are here at such a late hour. The Commission has been unable to comply with European law and deliver its report on the work of OLAF on schedule. Parliament has been waiting for this report. We assumed that as the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission itself could not possibly breach the Treaties – I have in mind Regulation 1073/99. That is why we are meeting here this evening. I hope that this will not happen again and hope to see the report in the very near future. We will be dealing with this issue during the discharge, Commissioner, as we cannot simply stand by and allow the guardian of the treaties knowingly to violate those same treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me turn to a couple of positive points. The first is that I am very pleased that OLAF's Supervisory Committee members have finally been reappointed, and I hope that we will be adopting an amendment on that tomorrow. We were appalled that one Member State should have attempted to block the reappointment of those members for very trivial reasons. I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on this achievement, and I specifically wish to thank you, Commissioner, for your support in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I am very pleased that the Commission is finally intending to take measures against a former Commissioner. In doing so it will be complying with the specific wishes of the European Parliament, in accordance with Article 213 of the EC Treaty. Quite apart from the financial scale of the alleged irregularities, it is important for this matter to be progressed if we are to change Europe's administrative culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, while I am talking about our administrative culture, that of course brings me to the subject of Eurostat. I really did not think that it was still possible, over three years after the resignation of a Commission, for nothing to be done about issues affecting an institution as important as Eurostat, which actually has to monitor the warning letters sent to the EU's finance ministers. I can tell you now that it was not Parliament that uncovered these irregularities but the Commission, which has known since 1999 at the latest that things were not right with Eurostat, and you have simply stood by and done nothing for years. The only measure that you have taken has to do with the official who raised this issue again after OLAF's failure to act in 1999, whom you packed off to Denmark on full pay.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation reminds me of a Dutch official we once had here, when exactly the same thing happened. No action was taken, there was not a trace of the zero tolerance policy promised us at the beginning of this period. All I can do is to call on the Commission to mend its ways here as soon as possible. Your responsibilities are not just limited to a square mile in Brussels, you are responsible to 370 million Europeans – 370 million Europeans who are represented by this House, and it seems that you still want to hide more from us than you reveal to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you an example of what I consider to be unacceptable. I received a telephone call today, and I hope you will allow me a few more seconds to mention this, Mr President, because a fundamental issue is at stake here. As you know, funds are provided under EU budget heading A-3035 for maintaining the sites of Nazi concentration camps. We are talking here about one of the foundations for the unification of Europe. There is also provision for supporting organisations whose primary aim is to keep alive the memory of the victims of Nazi concentration camps or to investigate the phenomenon of National Socialism from a historical point of view. All applications need to relate to a project commencing between 1 July 2003 and 1 December 2003 and ending by 30 June 2004. Commissioner, the commemorative days for the victims of these Nazi camps are held on the anniversary of their liberation. It is a matter of fact that back in 1945 the camps were not liberated between 1 July and 31 December, but in the spring, in April and May, and that is when these memorial days are marked. Have your officials still failed to realise that, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">This is a good example of the failure to reform the European Union's administration. I accordingly call on you to put an end to such nonsense immediately and to finally enact provisions that reflect the breadth and dignity of this programme! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I have noted your last point once again, and we can talk about that immediately after this debate. It is of course always very difficult to achieve a universally acceptable and uniform basis for the arrangements for the A30 budget headings. Nevertheless, I am more than willing to have another look at this.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against fraud in the Community budget is at the top of the Commission's agenda in all areas of policy. All the Commission's services are obliged to act accordingly. The establishment of OLAF, the European Fraud Investigation Office, has been an enormous step forward at Community level in protecting the Community's finances.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to a proposal I made in July 2000, the Prodi Commission agreed on an overall strategy for protecting the Community's financial interests and an Action Plan for 2001-2003. Of the measures for which it provided, 75% have already been implemented, and I regard that as a good outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch's report relates primarily to the Commission's report on the fight against fraud in 2001. However, it also covers other OLAF documents, measures and investigations. You are renowned for your critical attitude, Mr Bösch, but you are also known for your thoroughness and for the enormous amount of time and effort you devote to your reports. You are also well known for actually giving your full support to those measures you say you will support. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, and I would particularly like to thank him for supporting the Commission's action against tobacco smuggling and for his whole-hearted support for the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report emphasises the need for close cooperation with the Member States; it includes a review of the measures taken by the Member States in 2001 with a view to enhancing protection of the Community's financial interests. That relates to controls on Community funds. Structural Fund monies and agricultural expenditure are administered by the Member States. That also relates to the reporting of any irregularities uncovered and to the recovery of funds that have not been correctly used or even where fraud is alleged.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are also obliged to recover agricultural subsidies or Structural Fund monies from beneficiaries in the event of irregularities. Mr Bösch's report quite rightly emphasises the importance of recovering Community funds. In order to make the process more effective, the Commission has redefined responsibilities in its departments. Its December 2002 communication on the recovery of Community support funds goes into further detail on the distribution of tasks and on procedures, proposes preventive measures and enhances the responsibility of authorising officers.</p>
<p class="contents">A task force has been set up to deal with costs arising from the past in relation to the EAGGF, and this task force has already started its work. I do of course need to say at this juncture that many cases are disputed in the courts, because the final beneficiaries often defend themselves – as do indeed some Member States – against recovery by bringing actions in court.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF has continued to develop means of improving its cooperation with the Member States. OLAF now has intelligence capacity, which assists in the process of setting priorities and establishing strategies for fraud prevention, and it also has a unit consisting of judges and public prosecutors.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the OLAF progress report drawn up under Article 15 of the OLAF Regulation. This is due to be completed shortly. It will appear on the Commission's agenda within the next four weeks and will then be presented to the Supervisory Committee. I am of course pleased that it has finally been possible to find a solution here. All five members of the Supervisory Committee have informed us that they are willing to be appointed for a second period of office. I regard that and the continuity it will provide in consolidating OLAF's work as being very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the statistics on cases reported by the Member States of irregularities as regards own resources and EAGGF and Structural Fund monies. The general trend is one of a reduction in the amounts involved in 2001 as compared with the previous year. However, we cannot draw any significant conclusions about general trends from the figures for just one year, especially because it was not possible in the report to differentiate between fraud and more general irregularities, because in this respect the Member States do not yet report in a uniform way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working with Member States through the Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention, known as Cocolaf, to achieve a uniform reporting system. A working document on this subject was presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control last December. We hope to make significant progress in this field this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur attaches particularly importance to cooperation on fraud prevention with the candidate countries. With enlargement in mind the Commission has devoted considerable effort to ensuring that each of the candidate countries has an administrative organisation or structure that is clearly responsible for protecting the financial interests of the Communities and for preventing fraud against the Community budget. This organisation also needs to be in a position to work directly with OLAF and I believe that is in accordance with the rapporteur's proposal regarding branch offices.</p>
<p class="contents">In Poland these structures were extended in 2001 and 2002 with the support of an OLAF official working there, and the Commission made EUR 15 million from the Phare programme available to Poland in order to develop those structures and increase efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to fraud prevention in order to protect the EU's finances, however, it is not just a question of cooperation between the Member States and cooperation with the Commission, nor are we just talking about the candidate countries. We are also talking about cooperation with third countries, for instance Switzerland. In this case negotiations on the fraud prevention agreement are still going on. As you know, this is connected with the agreement on the taxation of interest and Switzerland has recently made it clear once again that its view remains that all agreements relating to the ten current sets of bilateral negotiations should be concluded simultaneously. We will continue to endeavour to achieve a different outcome, but that is Switzerland's position and it is very difficult to make progress on this given that one point relating to the Schengen Agreement is a very important issue still under negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to touch upon one final but important point. We have now reached a decisive stage as regards criminal law protection of the financial interests of the Community, by which I mean work in the Convention. This is a key moment. Significant progress towards the creation of a European Public Prosecutor may be achieved, and that is a proposal that has the support of both Parliament and the Commission. I urge the Convention to give its active support to this important idea. We really are at a turning point now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also be adopting the follow-up report on its Green Paper next week or by the latest the following week. The report assesses the results of the public consultation and demonstrates once again how important the creation of a European Public Prosecutor is for the fight against fraud as a whole. I also hope that the report by Mrs Theato which was adopted here in the plenary will be given due weight in the Convention's deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud are crucial components in guaranteeing the rights of citizens in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party welcomes the almost 40% reduction in the total annual volume of fraud and irregularities between 2000 and 2001. This fell from EUR 2 028 million in 2000 to EUR 1 275 million in 2001. Fraud reduction has taken place in all spheres, except in the Structural Funds, where there has been an increase.</p>
<p class="contents">We are unhappy, however, with the low recovery rate, which has fallen considerably. The Committee on Budgetary Control has on several occasions expressed its unhappiness with the poor functioning of the system and the need for its management to be improved. Our Group also hopes that the Commission will fulfil its commitment to a policy of zero tolerance with regard to internal fraud, and that it duly informs Parliament of developments made in the various cases in progress and in recently-opened investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party believes it to be crucial that the Accession Treaties take account of the candidate countries’ capacity for control and looks forward to hearing the Court of Auditors’ assessment of each of these countries’ financial control systems. We must recall, however, that knowing the control capacity of these countries is not enough, since, with enlargement, our new borders with Russia will mean a real danger of increased fraud, which will inevitably have repercussions for the Community’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot discuss the fight against fraud without referring to the future general reform of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, which is currently being discussed in the Convention and which is reflected in the amendments tabled by my Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the publication of the Commission’s Green Paper on criminal-law protection of the Community’s financial interests and of the Convention’s proposal to reform Article 280 of the Treaty, the establishment of a new body is being proposed, one that will have the task of ensuring the protection of the Community’s financial interests: a European Prosecutor. With regard to both external fraud – perpetrated in the various Member States – and to internal – that is, institutional – fraud, we in Parliament, and specifically the Committee on Budgetary Control, look forward to hearing the response of the various Member States to the proposal for a European Prosecutor, since we are attempting to determine the most appropriate way of dealing with this body, particularly with regard to its competences and to a relationship that befits a body for coordination and assistance, such as Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we would like the possible references that this report makes to the report on the European Prosecutor – for which Mrs Theato was responsible – to be made very clear and, to this end, probably before the vote tomorrow, my Group will table an amendment in the aim of preventing confusion arising between the reports by Mrs Theato and Mr Bösch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, (whom I wish immediately to congratulate on the report you have presented us with), I wish to begin by recalling that it was two years ago that I had occasion to condemn, here in this Parliament, with regard to the 1999 OLAF report, the Commission’s silence and indifference towards the adulteration of tens of thousands of tonnes of butter perpetrated in the latter half of the 1990s, involving countless major European companies. Then, as now, the underlying philosophy was that OLAF’s investigations and conclusions should always be secret and are intended ultimately for the national judicial authorities, and remain secret even when these authorities do nothing with them and do not even ask for them to be treated with any degree of secrecy. Secrecy is so great that the Commission, Parliament, and the Council are all unaware of irregularities and their perpetrators and consequently of the measures that are needed immediately for confronting those involved in illegal activity at the political and administrative levels. Secrecy is normally only broken in the press, where it frequently appears as a form of accusation, without giving individuals – who are not presumed innocent – any advance warning or the right to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how we have reached a situation in which OLAF’s investigations into contracts between the Commission and the company Eurogramme, which began as long ago as 1999, are completely ignored by the Luxembourg judicial authorities, and also by the Commission, whose Secretary-General decided to close the case with one blow of the gavel, without even informing the Commissioner responsible of the existence of this trial and allowing dozens of contracts to be signed in the meantime between this company and the Commission. In practical terms, this means that an investigation by OLAF can be a curse for anyone who, as we have seen in real cases that have already come to light, is completely innocent and has his or her name dragged through the mud by the press. This can also be a blessing for the lawbreakers, who see it as a guarantee of almost total secrecy and of impunity. This is a total perversion of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make it clear that Parliament cannot put up with this situation and that we must instigate change immediately. This change involves, first of all, the issue of secrecy. Secrecy must only be invoked when it is crucial to protecting the good name and the reputation of the person accused or to the successful outcome of the investigation. Unless one of these reasons is invoked objectively and within a set time-limit by the parties involved, either the defendant or the judicial authorities, OLAF must, without delay, notify and forward the relevant information to those entitled to see it, particularly the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">Secrecy should be the exception and not the rule. Similarly, I think that the time has come to ask ourselves where is this situation going to end and what do the Luxembourg authorities intend to do about the various complaints that have been forwarded by OLAF. In order to be able to act effectively and not to have to work only on rumours or on vague, incomplete or even contradictory information, the authorities must be informed. The public must also receive its information in a different way and not only through leaks. This is all we are calling for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is renowned for his thoroughness and persistence, which have so often been the hallmark of the Committee on Budgetary Control in the past and which in fact led to OLAF being set up in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has proved its worth as a very worthy guardian of the interests of the public and has initiated an administrative reform of which it can be proud. There is no doubt that OLAF could sometimes be more transparent, and I accept the criticisms expressed about that, including those of Mr Casaca. There is also no doubt that the public should sometimes be given information about OLAF at an earlier stage and more openly, as OLAF needs to publicise itself more. Nevertheless, I believe that we as Members should also stress that OLAF is a success story.</p>
<p class="contents">What would have become of Eurostat without OLAF? What would have become of Eurostat without the courageous witnesses who have gone to OLAF and been able to make statements? That issue is still being pursued today. Looking back to what happened in 1999, it has to be said that it was UCLAF, OLAF's predecessor, which attempted at the time to play the matter down, and OLAF – demonstrating once again that the switch from UCLAF to OLAF was right – has grasped the opportunity with both hands to get this issue back on the agenda and to find a solution to the Eurostat problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, and I think that this is a point we can all agree upon, it is clear that there are major problems about continuing to follow up the Eurostat case. It is clear that without the second step that must finally be taken now, by which I mean the step of setting up a European Public Prosecutor's office, it will repeatedly be left to the Member States to decide what measures to take. I therefore wish to take this opportunity to make a very clear appeal to the Convention to have the courage to take that positive step. I fear that the Member States themselves will not have the courage. Without the Convention we cannot hope to succeed in this, and we need a European Public Prosecutor to turn the administrative reform we have initiated with OLAF into a real success story. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gargani (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I feel I must comment on the report by Mr Bösch on the protection of the Communities’ financial interests and the fight against fraud. The report has a coherence of its own, it has some qualities, and a fair evaluation has already been made of it this evening in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In this document, however, the chapter on ‘Strengthening the criminal law dimension’ – from paragraph 58 to paragraph 65 – interferes, as has already been pointed out, with the institution of the European Prosecutor, on which the Committee on Legal Affairs – which I have the honour to chair – gave an unfavourable opinion and then it found points of compromise with the Theato report, which we must look into more carefully. This is certainly solid ground that we should occupy, but, I repeat, we must find a balance.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, which in some way also interferes with the provision to be discussed at the end of March during the Brussels mini-session, does not even, I think, rationalise the legislative system. The legislative simplification we are talking about is a proposal that, in practice, rather puts the cart before the horse, and we are forced to table some amendments to it. In effect, the proposal again creates a European Prosecutor with competence to follow up judgments and crimes that harm the Community’s financial interests. In truth, it is quite unacceptable to the Committee on Legal Affairs because the legal order of the European Union provides neither competences in matters of criminal procedural law nor a judiciary at all levels of jurisdiction that could ensure a full right to defence. In the absence of such a context, the aggregation of a European Public Prosecutor is illogical and unjustified, and I must emphasise this and also tell the Commissioner, who has rather hastily dismissed the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We must think about this carefully, because the creation of such a body is premature, if one considers that the objectives of judicial cooperation – which prevails here – have not been achieved and that it is necessary to harmonise the rules on criminal matters in Member State institutions. One cannot simply attribute criminal law competence to the Court of Justice: the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance were set up for other purposes and, anyway, it is not necessary to create a European Prosecutor when we just have to strengthen judicial cooperation, taking inspiration from the principle of subsidiarity, which is precisely the criterion on which we must base our action. We must therefore continue to enhance the competences of Eurojust, and to strengthen and coordinate these powers at a European level. The amendments tabled are therefore to clarify matters; all the rest of the report can go ahead. We are very afraid that, with the single exception of Italy, where the judicial order is being remodelled at this very moment, in no other country in Europe do prosecutors enjoy the status and powers that we want to give to the European Prosecutor, which is at the root of the alarm at the level of legal consistency and the European legal area.</p>
<p class="contents">These are misgivings we are going to voice regarding the European Public Prosecutor, but since the issue has in effect come up surreptitiously in this measure, we must formulate them right now in this Parliament and remedy them through the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
