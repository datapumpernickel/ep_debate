<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that we have achieved a great innovation. The first reading was at 23.33 on Tuesday evening, and it is now 21.02 on Wednesday evening, so I must say that we have made tremendous progress. As far as I know, this is the first time that we have had a second reading on Wednesday evening and then the voting on Thursday. In that sense, then, we have taken a step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of public sector information is naturally a very important issue. We talk so often about the re-use of public sector information, saying ‘it was agreed in Lisbon that the European Union should become “the most competitive … knowledge-based” society in the world’. Premiers go home afterwards with tears in their eyes because they have just said that. As soon as we get back to reality, however, we feel fierce anger, because what then lies ahead of us is an endless struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">At the second reading, we had to deal with a Council common position containing a large number of comments which, it has to be said, did not have a great deal to do with the ambitious objectives agreed in Lisbon. To illustrate: one could say that auctions of third-generation frequencies, for example UMTS, have now fetched so much money for the Member States that they would say ‘we are now prepared to make as much information as possible available free of charge’. The reverse is true. Public sector bodies simply want more money for the use of public sector information. My colleagues and I have had to fight extremely hard with the Council in order to take a step forwards on that point. I am very happy, therefore, that we have indeed been able to take that step. Nevertheless, we have to accept the fact that reality is far more difficult than we should like.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, there remains the point to which I am always referring. Imagine that you are an entrepreneur in a small SME in Italy. You are not, but imagine that you are. Imagine also that you want public sector information that you intend to re-use. You must imagine that scenario in a Union that is soon to have 25 Member States all having their own, unpublished, assets lists. You then have to contend with a situation in which you have to use a pink form in one case and a green one in the other; in language X in one case and language Y in the other – and you have to keep on top of all of this as an entrepreneur in a small SME. That is simply not possible. For this reason, I am also very pleased that we have finally been able to convince the Council, too, that there must be an assets list stating explicitly which public sector information is available for re-use and – if this can be done at all in these days of the Lisbon objectives – that it is also available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">We have managed to achieve this at the second reading, and I am extremely happy about that. We have also managed to tighten up the cost principles raised by the Council considerably and to make it clear that it is by no means always necessary to demand reimbursement of costs from citizens or enterprises that want to use public sector information. In some cases, however, for example where bodies are concerned which the government has privatised, and which themselves have financial commitments, there is no other way. However, express limits then have to be imposed on this. That point proved a very difficult one – including internally. We discussed it at great length, but, in my opinion, obtained a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council did not want to use the word ‘information’ – it only wanted to speak of ‘document’. I asked the Council, therefore, whether it is a European document society that we have or a European information society. Of course, everyone saw the humour in that, and ultimately we did reach the compromise that we could keep the word ‘information’; even though ‘document’ is used throughout the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to tell one final anecdote. We wanted a situation in which information follows promptly after submission of a request. In our enthusiasm, we said that this had to be within three weeks. We then spent approximately one hour squabbling with the Council as to whether that deadline should be three weeks or 20 working days. I was then convinced by the fact that working weeks are shorter than five days in some Member States. Some Member States have a lot more days’ holiday than others. We finally changed it to 20 working days: this could mean three or four weeks in one Member State, and approximately five weeks in another, but there you have the multiformity of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank my colleagues, in particular, for the confidence they have shown in me. I have been able to count on a great deal of support from Mrs Read and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel in my negotiations in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Thanks to them, and to the excellent cooperation with the European Commission, we have come through, and we can in any case present a result that I believe satisfies our minimum expectations. We are going to carry out an evaluation in three years’ time, and I hope that the Council will then have progressed slightly, and that we are really going to take the Lisbon objectives very seriously. I should like to thank everyone for their confidence and for the help they have given me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Content in the digital economy covers all types of information, text, images and sounds that can be transmitted over the networks. It is the ‘water’ flowing in the pipes of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The advance of broadband critically depends on the availability of suitable content.</p>
<p class="contents">Public sector information is a key content resource. It is collected by a large number of public sector bodies in their execution of public tasks. Examples are geographic information, legal and administrative information and tourist information. This information can be re-used and built upon to make new information services.</p>
<p class="contents">One good example of these services is the re-use of digital maps for mobile applications. There are some examples already on the market, but this directive will make them much more frequent.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will create legal certainty for companies that want to make Europe-wide information products on the basis of public sector information. It will stimulate the creation of new information services based on, or incorporating, public sector information. The key elements for achieving this are transparency, non-discrimination and fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad about the progress achieved since the Commission made its proposal for a directive in June 2002, and count on a rapid adoption and transposition of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, for his interest in this topic and for the thorough job he has done. The amendments tabled for the vote in plenary are the result of negotiations between Parliament and the Council. If all the amendments are adopted as they stand, this will make it possible to finalise the directive at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept all the amendments. These amendments constitute a considerable improvement on the text of the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, at the very start I also want to thank the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen for his expertise and contribution, which made it possible to bring this Directive into existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the compromise proposals reached by the rapporteur in conjunction with the Council, because that way we would be spared the laborious and always risky Conciliation Committee debate. The European Parliament wants the Member States to implement this directive swiftly, as, when they do, its benefits for the public and business will be indisputable. Genuine free mobility in Europe will not come about until its citizens and companies have clear ideas about what documents are available where and at what cost. Harmonisation is needed in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise amendments take a stand on <span class="italic">inter alia </span>the availability of public documents, where possible through electronic means. I agree with Mr van Velzen that it would be a lot more logical and realistic to speak about public information rather than documents. Not all documents are printed exclusively on paper anymore. Various electronic publishing formats are rapidly becoming more common and records are being kept in electronic format more than before.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the public sector sets a good example as we journey towards the information society. Many public documents consist <span class="italic">par excellence</span> of that intelligent and meaningful content which is so much spoken about, especially in connection with wireless services. The various forms have to be available on the Internet. Users will therefore definitely come along for different applications, for 3G, 4G or 5G, when there is meaningful content. I, at least, can no longer get enthusiastic about ordering merely amusing images for my cell phone.</p>
<p class="contents">Another controversial issue has been how much public agencies can charge for their services, or whether they can demand money at all. Right from the outset I have promoted the policy whereby public documents are of universal use and belong to everyone. Agencies and institutions paid for out of taxes are obliged to do the job they were originally set up to do, which is to provide a service for those who own and finance them, the taxpayers. For basic services, materials and data, however, specialist organisations must be able to recover their costs and make a reasonable charge.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of whether a charge should be made takes on a new aspect when we start talking about customised services produced for individual customers or, in this case, ordinary citizens. These are typical chargeable services, for which the public sector also has to be able to demand payment. A customised service could include design and preparation work to produce a map, for example, perhaps for a car orienteering competition, as the Commissioner mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Compiling basic data the way an individual customer wants it, the compilation of statistics for example, is a customised service. In such a case it is only reasonable that the official body undertaking the specialist work should charge for services rendered in accordance with normal market economy legislation. The upkeep of specialist organisation know-how, development work and developing new technology must be made possible out of revenue either on taxes or these chargeable services – customised tasks. In many Member States many kinds of specialist know-how are in the hands of public institutions, for historical or cultural reasons, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word: this is an area which will take us on towards the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. In which year that will happen none of us know, but this is one small step in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly want to draw attention to some things that are in the compromise and some things that, quite properly, are no longer there.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I draw attention to the special needs of the trading bodies that apply particularly in the United Kingdom, such as the Meteorological Office, the Ordnance Survey and the British Geological Survey, which, unless they had been protected with the ability to get a reasonable return on investment, would have had their own work and their own positions seriously jeopardised. I am grateful to the rapporteur for the way in which he has accommodated this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the cost calculation method is included in the criteria. That is important for all sorts of people and organisations which, we hope, will make use of the ability to re-use public sector documents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that libraries, museums, universities and other archives, which would have been covered in the original proposal, are now excluded from the directive. Once we all realised what a serious disadvantage they would have, there was an agreement that such a proposal should no longer be included.</p>
<p class="contents">When I took over as shadow rapporteur on this report, I did it with little knowledge of how interesting it would be and how, very soon, it would become apparent that the re-use of public sector documents would prove to be such an important economic motor. We can see the limited re-use which currently exists, how it can be extended and how important it is going to be, as the previous speaker said, in the Lisbon conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw attention to just one other thing, namely the review of this directive, in which I hope this Parliament will be involved in future. One of the things that rightly concerns many of us is the extent to which this directive would encourage cross-border re-use. If we discover in our review period, when the Commission does this, that cross-border re-use has either not happened or been very limited, then we might well have to revisit some of the elements in this particular proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I commend to you Mr van Velzen's work and the compromise for which my group will happily vote. We look forward in the future to seeing how the fruits of this work are going to bring immediate benefits – long-term benefits, employment benefits and business benefits – to the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has extracted the best out of the situation. Every citizen in Europe has the right of access to information collected and stored by the public sector. Indeed, transparency on the part of the public sector is a good thing for democracy, and democracy comes free of charge in Europe. In addition, public sector information has significant economic potential. The Directive should lead to the emergence of an active trade in public sector information in the European Union, as in the United States. There is enormous unexplored potential, which could create a large number of jobs if exploited commercially, particularly via SMEs: small and medium-sized enterprises. I envisage a central role for the public sector here in giving impetus to a new market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission presented an ambitious proposal; but a number of Member States evidently have little interest in it. They have toned it down so much that we are left with the question whether the single market in public sector information will function in the longer term, let alone the short term. It has become clear that Member States are not prepared to make public sector information available free of charge, despite constantly making a great song and dance about eEurope and an information society for all. Fine words.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to follow things through. For information to be generally accessible, it goes without saying that the marginal costs of reproduction and distribution can be passed on. Now, however, it is permissible to increase the costs by ‘a reasonable’ profit margin. That is undesirable, as it creates unlimited possibilities for the authorities to make a profit: after all, who decides what is ‘reasonable’?</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal again talks about public sector documents instead of public sector information. This means that there is no guarantee that information reproduced electronically is also covered by the definition. Thus, public sector bodies are tempted to limit accessibility to printed documents. Straightforward access to public sector information, preferably via the Internet, reduces the distance between the European authorities and the citizen. The public sector should be encouraged to make as many documents as possible available to citizens electronically, therefore. That is a crucial precondition for the creation of eEurope: an information society for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the manner we have come to expect of him on the basis of many other such tasks, he has, at second reading too, been very committed and successfully thrown himself into getting his report adopted. Until literally the last minute, he has been fine-tuning the compromises in collaboration with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In common, I am sure, with the majority of this House and of my political group, I share the view that public information should be made generally accessible in the interests of everyone involved. With the approval of the present directive, we are taking a sound and sensible step in this direction. The authorities in the Member States have vast amounts of information available, accumulated over long periods of time. People and companies ought to benefit from this wealth of information.</p>
<p class="contents">General access to public information is capable of releasing important impulses for growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union. With the help of public sector documents, new services and benefits may be generated in the IT sphere. In my opinion, the documents assembled by the administrations are, in any case, being made accessible by this Directive only in a very moderate way. The authorities therefore also have the time required to adjust to the new conditions. The Council and Parliament have taken account of the corresponding reservations from first reading. Let us not forget, in this connection, that differences still exist in the national traditions of administration and have to be taken into account. In those cases in which the Member States allow the publication of public sector documents, the directive now provides uniform ground rules on a Europe-wide basis. I should like here only to go into a few areas that should be particularly emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific sensitive areas such as research, the arts and documents containing commercial secrets are rightly excluded from the scope of the directive. These exemption regulations guarantee that the directive will not infringe the rights of third parties. When funds are scarce, authorities should also, in my view, definitely be entitled to demand fees for making information available, as well as a suitable profit margin. Let us not forget that many authorities are, in part, self-financing. Moreover, the business of, for example, gathering, updating and looking after up-to-the-minute data also costs money. It is important, however, to maintain a suitable balance. The costs must not, of course, give rise to any excessive barriers to the re-use of documents, and I think that the directive now also makes this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Of extraordinary importance to the success of the directive is the preparation of central lists, providing people and companies with rapid overviews of the available documents. This, of course, is where, especially, use of the Internet comes in. If a particular authority no longer makes documents available or no longer updates them, its decision not to do so should be published as soon as possible. This would give those affected a bigger safety margin in terms of planning.</p>
<p class="contents">The long fought-for cross-border use of public documents is to be welcomed. Let us not, however, overlook the existing language barriers that make such use more difficult. It would, in my view, be completely counter-productive to impose translation obligations upon the Member States in the long term. Let us protect ourselves against tendencies of that kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to state that this directive constitutes an appropriate and well-balanced approach that takes account of people’s and companies’ interests, without however ignoring the national traditions of administration. Let us therefore vote tomorrow in favour of accepting the directive.</p>

He does so smoothly and shrewdly and the results just pour out. I wish to thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many kinds of information, and public information is one. Administrative data must obviously be free of charge to the public and it has to be obtainable from one place, or portal. As far as the business world is concerned, it will obviously pay for renewal to be possible at the point where information is created, thus getting a return on investment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important area. It is estimated that public sector information is worth in the region of EUR 70 billion a year and the content industry employs about four million people in the European Union. That is a lot. This market is worth more than EUR 400 billion. Even the value of the mobile communications industry is set to rise in the near future to around EUR 20 million in terms of its content, and that is content on a relatively tiny scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge and information are the most important factors in a democracy and an economy. The fact that we are saturated with information separates us from the less well-off. It is a security factor and an instrument of war. ‘Information poverty’ hits the same people as social poverty. Would the chance of a little charity not help? After all, information does not shrink at the point from which it is distributed to others, no matter how much of it is shared. I would furthermore like to ask the Commissioner whether this could not be one new element in our development assistance programme: the sharing of information and knowledge, because we will not have any less of it even if we share it with others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
