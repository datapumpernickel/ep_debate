<p class="contents">Madam President, I should like to respond to the concerns expressed earlier by Mrs Figueiredo, and by the Secretary of State, Mrs Torres Marques and the Minister, Mr Cunha, following the very serious natural disasters which have stricken the northern region of Portugal. As I am the Commissioner responsible for dealing with these issues, I wish to inform them that we shall take advantage of every possibility of reallocating appropriations, just as we have done in other circumstances in the event of natural disasters elsewhere in Europe, in order to stand by the Portuguese authorities in meeting the exceptional costs of reconstruction, repairs or indeed preventative measures necessitated by these disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the greater part of the discussion in the European Commission was taken up with approving the report, the Second Report on Economic and Social Cohesion in the Union, which it was my honour to present, with the agreement of my fellow Commissioners, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">I presented this report pursuant to Article 159 of the Treaty, with which you are familiar, just as Monica Wulf-Mathies did in 1996. It was as a result of this 1996 report that the first information became available, which was used in drawing up Agenda 2000. A detailed summary of the report is available in three languages at the entrance to the Chamber. The first part of the report which I am presenting gives, for the first time, a snapshot of the European Union in terms of cohesion for the 27 countries of the Union post-enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the report analyses the impact of other Community policies on the Union’s objectives. It assesses the results achieved by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds. Finally, in the synthesis section, the report outlines a number of potential avenues or recommendations for the future. Let me repeat, we have already made a summary available to each of you. The complete report, ladies and gentlemen, will be available as of this evening on the Internet, along with all the appended maps and statistics pertaining thereto.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I would like to make in my opening remarks, before listening to your views. What are the issues at stake in cohesion within the enlarged Union and how can we address these issues?</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue I shall raise is that of a global environment undergoing rapid and far-reaching change, which affects each of our countries and hence also the European Union as a whole: the issue of globalisation and the context of new activities based on intelligence and knowledge, the new economy, the information society, and the issue of demographic structure. This is compounded by the ever greater expectation on the part of our fellow citizens, as you are well aware, for our policies to be clearer, to involve the citizens themselves, and for increased partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is enlargement. We face the prospect of a European Union with 27 or perhaps even 28 members, and what becomes clear from reading this report carefully is that this enlarged Union will contain greater disparities, greater inequalities, to an extent unprecedented in previous rounds of enlargement. There are three key figures you should bear in mind in this respect: with the forthcoming enlargement, the population of the European Union will increase by 30%, and the surface area of the Union will increase by 30%, yet the Union’s gross domestic product will increase by only 5%. That is why in this report we identified a third group of countries, which will include the eight poorest candidate countries, which will comprise 16% of the population of the enlarged Union, where the per capita income is approximately only 40% of the Community average. This is where the main challenge and the real change lie. Consequently, with enlargement, the centre of gravity of cohesion policy is going to shift eastwards. Of the 105 million inhabitants of the candidate countries, 98 million will be living in regions where the level of GDP per inhabitant is less than 75% of the average in the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, ladies and gentlemen, the entry of extremely poor Eastern European countries into the European Union is not going to turn the existing poor regions in southern, northern and central Europe – I am thinking of the remote and outermost regions too – all of a sudden into prosperous and rich regions, as if by magic. The regions currently covered by Objective 1 are still in difficulty, even if there has been some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been progress. Per capita income in these regions has moved closer to the Community average. It has increased from 63% in 1988 to 69% in 1997. Partly with the help of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds, the countries covered by cohesion policy have experienced economic growth at a rate higher than the Community average. Yet, within an increasing number of Member States, the tendency is not towards the elimination of disparities. Disparities continue to exist and are even being exacerbated. Unemployment stands at more than 20% in some regions, regions which have for a considerable length of time been left out in terms of progress due to their remote nature and depopulation, and the employment rate for women is 19 percentage points below that of men. These are the observations you can read in the report, in which we describe the territorial inequalities, the pockets of poverty, sometimes extreme poverty, in some urban districts and some rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we address these issues? Ladies and gentlemen, in our view, cohesion policy must continue to be the key element in the European Union’s societal model. We are part of a European Union which wishes to formalise its structures of solidarity. This means we have to ask three questions of cohesion policy: why, for whom and how?</p>
<p class="contents">Why? I sometimes hear it said that it is not possible to do everything from Brussels and that more subsidiarity is needed. I am all in favour of greater subsidiarity, but I am not and I shall never be in favour of allowing cohesion policy to become nothing more than the transfer of funding. It is not enough just to send cheques. We cannot accept any form of renationalisation of cohesion policy for we still have shared priorities, genuine Community priorities and it is in our shared interest to ensure the sustainable and balanced development of a frame of reference for cohesion policy. The debate is only just beginning. I do not have any decisions to offer you, just some thoughts, perhaps. One of these thoughts is based on the experience gained over more than ten years of cohesion policy, and leads me to think that there are matters that are more crucial and more serious than others for the development of our territories. As I have mentioned already, there is the urban issue, networking, or even the specific issues affecting areas that are handicapped in geographical terms; by remoteness, mountainous topography or other natural handicaps.</p>
<p class="contents">Human resources, too, must be taken into account, since that affects employment. Our report specifically lays down some guidelines to achieving more high quality jobs, improved social integration and equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, taking this debate into consideration, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission could be ready, when the time comes, to propose a more strategic and coherent approach to EU territorial development to the other community institutions, so that our continued objective of economic and social cohesion would be strengthened by an increased territorial dimension and territorial support. For whom do we implement cohesion policy? I am convinced of two points in this respect, and these convictions are shared by the Commission as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we must continue to prioritise support for the regions lagging the furthest behind in development terms, for future Member States but also for current EU Member States. The whole problem of priority support for the most underdeveloped regions, of course, raises the question of the level at which we shall have to set the eligibility threshold for regions which are developing too slowly.</p>
<p class="contents">My second conviction is that the regions lagging behind in development are not the only ones facing problems to which we must find solutions. Other regions within the enlarged Union are affected too. If we are to have Community priorities then we must contemplate measures that can be implemented throughout the territory of the European Union for often, within a single state, there are regions that are richer than others and sometimes even within a single region there are areas of exclusion right next to highly dynamic areas – as is shown in the urban audit which I issued a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is increasingly possible to delegate implementation to the Member States, applying the principle of subsidiarity better than in the past, on condition that we are sure that Community priorities are being respected and that European funding continues to go to those that have the greatest need. How are we to carry out this cohesion policy? This can be summed up in two phrases, improved efficiency and improved management. I have presented my explanations to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and I shall present my explanations to the Committee on Budgetary Control – but it must be a credible policy with ambition, as I have just mentioned, and with sufficient funding. We did not, at this stage, wish to carry out assessments or budget estimates. It would be too early; we would be putting the cart before the horse. Let us first discuss objectives, content and European priorities. Only afterwards will we have to find the resources to support these priorities. My only observation, one which I wish to bring to the attention of the House, is that among the various issues decided in Berlin in 1999, one specific decision was that in 2006, at the end of this programming period, by adding up the amounts allocated to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the pre-accession appropriations, particularly ISPA, and the appropriations set aside to cover the costs of the first accessions prior to 2006, we obtain a total allocation, combining all these, equivalent to 0.45% of Community GDP. I see that figure as a reference point. It will be a key figure in the discussion of financial matters that we shall have with you and the Member States when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, whatever the level of expenditure in relation to the increase in disparities, I think it safe to say that any cohesion policy will be credible only insofar as it is supported by adequate funding. Whatever the level of structural expenditure, the key thing is that the content of other Community policies should also promote cohesion, as the Treaty recommends. In terms of coordination with other Community policies, there is still progress to be made, particularly in order to improve synergy. I am thinking here of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. Before answering your questions, I would like to stress that this report does not offer any firm or definitive guidelines. It does not put forward any decisions, it merely opens the debate. It is a tool for information and assessment, a snapshot of the European Union which includes 27 Member States for the first time, and at the end we ask a few questions and make a few recommendations. We shall be much more precise in the third report in 2004, which will be issued very shortly before the time when decisions are taken on the new agenda. I merely consider that this debate on cohesion policy and this report testify to the fact that cohesion policy has been effective and useful, in accordance with the goals of the Treaty. Increased European unity, increased solidarity between the peoples of Europe and respect for the diversity of the territories of Europe: this continues to be our objective. This debate on cohesion forms part of the broader debate on the future of the European Union which was initiated in Nice and in which we are going to take part. You may count on us in the next three years leading up to the new intergovernmental conference in 2004 in the matter of this broader debate and of the specific debate on our concept of the European Union, the concept of the level of solidarity between nations and territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, and may I assure you of the European Commission’s respect for the valued role that Parliament will play in these discussions.</p>

<p class="contents">Now, as a Member of the European Parliament, I have to say that it is clear from the report on cohesion that there has been a relative improvement in our efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union and that, as you rightly said, we have had more success with the economic indicators than we have with the social indicators. Some countries, such as Ireland, have taken greater advantage of the opportunities given to them than have other countries. So the message which we should send out from the House today is that we need more efficient administration on all sides, especially on the part of the Member States and regions and, of course, we need incentives, such as the performance reserve, so that we can use European taxpayers' money more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, I agree that we need to start focusing on the poorest regions and countries of the European Union right now and again after 2006. But we must not forget one very important point: today's poorer countries are not going to get richer purely and simply because enlargement will artificially reduce the average per capita GDP in the European Union. That is something we must bear in mind if we are to avoid straying into misguided policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we need to concentrate resources, we need to make better use of resources, we need to call for better administration both on the part of the Commission and of the Member States and regions; however, that must not cause us to forget one basic fact: that more people will want a slice of the cake after enlargement and as far as I am concerned, Commissioner, it is vital that we increase the size of the cake, that we increase the resources of the Structural Funds after 2006. I should like to hear your views on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I formed my own assessment in the same spirit and on the same bases as yourself. I should point out to the House that if the twelve candidate countries were to actually join the European Union right now, then the mean GDP for the Community would drop by 18 points. This would automatically have the mathematical effect of raising regions which continue to be in difficulties above the mean in one fell swoop. It would not, therefore, be fair. We are going to have to find some solution for these regions which would thereby be placed automatically above the Community mean.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hatzidakis, you tell me more money will be needed. At this stage, I can express only a personal opinion. We have not yet reached the point of discussing the future Financial Perspective. I have only given you a rough indication, and a personal opinion at that. I think that the figure of 0.45 % of Community GDP, which will be achieved in 2006 in line with the Berlin decisions, if we add together the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds, pre-accession appropriations, SAPARD, PHARE, ISPA, as well as the appropriations placed in reserve to support the first accessions in 2004, for example, will give a total representing 0.45% of GDP. I see this as a reference point. To elaborate further, my frank opinion is that if we take on board another twelve countries in the state they are at present, then we shall not be able to conduct any credible policy at anything less than this percentage. That is all I can say for the present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the beginning of a debate – an honest debate – that we want to be involved in as parliamentarians. The Commissioner and Mr Hatzidakis said that regional disparities will become twice as great. The challenge to achieve cohesion will be greater: we have an unprecedented expansion of the Union and we still have poor regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a multi-million euro question which is, to use the words of a former French Commission President: “Have we got the means to match our ambitions?” That is not to say that the means have to be financial, but we must also look at other policies. It is clear that there will be a cap on budgetary contributions. Therefore I ask you, Commissioner Barnier and your colleagues, to look at the opportunities offered by other policies, in particular the real and tangible benefits of involving the private sector in regenerating our regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Can you be sure, Commissioner, that an enlightened view will be taken, in particular by Mr Monti, the Commissioner responsible for competition, to ensure that we have private sector innovative approaches to reducing regional disparities across the Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can indeed confirm the attitude of the Commission, which I, in particular, share, and our determination to take part, not just here but also in the national parliaments, and in and with the regions, in as decentralised a way as possible, in a major debate. My whole team in the Directorate-General is going to participate in presenting the results of the assessment of this snapshot and open the debate over the next two years, in an extremely transparent and open manner. The current annual allocation is approximately EUR thirty billion. Once again, I have told Mr Hatzidakis what I though of the lower limit beyond which we should not go if we wish this policy to have any credibility. I also think, like you, Mrs McCarthy, that this European policy must act as a lever, bringing other funding and other synergies to bear. That is why I attach great importance to partnership, the modernisation of private funds, and the intervention of the European Investment Bank as our partner. I quite understand, moreover, your concern for greater coherence with the competition policy for which Commissioner Monti is responsible. We have to find a way forward which reconciles complying with the Treaties, especially in terms of the rules of competition, and regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite simply, Mrs McCarthy, let me share my personal conviction that we shall not achieve solidarity and cohesion in Europe simply by counting on the laws of the market, on supply and demand or on a simple tax transfer policy. I do not believe that liberalism alone can help the poorest regions cease to be the poorest or that it can help reduce the gap between them and the richest regions. That is why I shall fight to ensure that we continue to have public intervention in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure it will provoke solid, but also controversial discussion, and so I would just like to take this opportunity to stimulate debate a little with a two-fold question. The current system will actually remain in force until the year 2006. Given that we are negotiating with the candidate countries with the aim of their acceding in 2004/2005, how then, can we make it clear to them that, even if they join under the current conditions, they cannot rely on our being able to continue the system, in other words, how are we going to make them understand that irrespective of what they sign up to now, they are going to have to adapt to an amended cohesion policy? Secondly, perhaps you could allay a little the fears which prevail across a good many regions by explaining to us how is it going to be possible for the regions which may receive less support after 2007, regardless of the ceiling we apply, not to lose support and solidarity at a moment’s notice? How can we make it possible for them – as has, in fact, been done hitherto using the phasing out method – to achieve the upturn gradually, without their being dropped from the system straightaway? You may be able to assuage quite a number of fears with your answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is probably the main question to be debated in terms of finance. Let me specify, nonetheless, that the Berlin Financial Perspective made provision to set aside some EUR 39.5 billion for the candidate countries likely to join before 2006, to enable them to be integrated into the current cohesion policy. After 2006, however, they will of course be entitled, like the current Member States, to participate in a policy which will probably be rather different.</p>
<p class="contents">My report outlined four possible approaches to cater for the regions which would automatically find themselves above the cut-off threshold as soon as we incorporate a number of very poor countries into the Union, and all I can do at this stage is outline these options. The first option is to continue to apply the strict threshold of 75% of Community GDP which is the current threshold below which regions are eligible for Objective 1 status, and therefore a greater concentration of appropriations. The second option is to link this 75% threshold with a phasing-out policy over a set period, supported by a substantial amount of money, in order to facilitate the transition for regions which, post-enlargement, would suddenly find themselves above that threshold. A third option is to raise the threshold above 75 % to make more regions eligible. In that case, we should probably have to tackle the issue of finance. The fourth option is to have two thresholds, one for regions currently within the Union and one for the regions of countries joining the Union. I am not in a position, nor do I have any wish, to decide the matter right now. I am here to listen to your views. I shall be listening to the views of the Member States, and the members of parliament and elected representatives of these regions. In the end, though, we shall have to opt for one of these four alternatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the report I even mentioned the fact that for the countries which are currently in the greatest difficulty within the European Union, the regions lagging furthest behind in development, it would take another generation to reduce this gap. I pointed out that it would take roughly, and I can only make a rough prediction, two generations for the countries scheduled to join us in approximately 2004-2005. I concur with your view that we shall be able to make a greater success of enlargement and the actual accession of these countries if we make the best possible preparations at this stage. That is why, alongside my fellow Commissioners, Mr Verheugen and Mr Fischler, who are responsible, respectively, for the PHARE programme and the SAPARD programme, whilst I myself am responsible for the ISPA programme for the environment and transport, I am committed to ensuring that this money is used properly, and that part of the technical assistance associated with these funds is used to set up territorial frameworks. This is the real weakness of the candidate countries whose regional divisions have not existed for very long. The Voivodships in Poland have only been in existence for two years. We must therefore support the territorial frameworks by means of these Structural Funds. Indeed, I never miss an opportunity to urge local communities within the current Union to set up twinning partnerships and decentralised cooperation agreements with candidate country regions in order to establish more ongoing cooperation on the human level within each territorial community. We attach great importance, therefore, to using these pre-accession funds as usefully as possible. I cannot, however, make any commitments, Mrs Schroedter, as to what we shall do with the money placed in reserve after 2002 – I mentioned approximately EUR 40 billion – if these countries do not join in 2002. For the time being the funds have been set aside to cater for those accessions that do actually take place. In response to your question, however, I should like to point out that we have pre-accession instruments and that these are what we should be using, when the time comes, to carry accession through successfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are only launching the debate. The budgets have been determined; the regulations have been defined. All these EU regions have received guarantees until 2006. I have endeavoured to tell the truth, because we cannot make speeches on enlargement and the enlarged European Union, integrating the closely related peoples of Eastern Europe, without looking at the figures as they stand. This is a truthful report. Yet I did not want to wait until 2005 before telling the truth and asking the questions which have to be asked of the Commission proposals, when the time comes, by the Heads of State and Government and by Parliament. So there is a problem, but there is no need to panic. I should also like to say, in answer to your specific question with regard to specific regions, Extremadura, southern Italy or the <span class="italic">Länder</span> of eastern Germany, that it will depend on the level of income achieved by around 2005-2006. What I do know, however, is that if we retain the criterion of per capita income – which I hope we do, since it is an objective criterion – then the average Community GDP is going to drop as a result of enlargement. The rate is going to drop to a greater or lesser extent, Mr Izquierdo Collado, according to whether the twelve candidate countries join at the same time or not. Once again, then, there is no need to panic. The drop will perhaps not be as much as the 18 points I mentioned earlier. The fact remains, however, that some regions currently covered by Objective 1, which are currently enjoying a good level of development even though this is still below average, are liable to find that they are above average following enlargement. We are going to have to find a solution to this. As I have said myself, these regions are not suddenly going to become rich just because Eastern European countries are joining the European Union. We are going to have to find a substantial solution for these regions and continue to support them, and I have outlined a few possible approaches. One of these, for example, would be to have a total budget allowance, similar to the system we set up for Ireland and other regions, to cover phasing out and a transitional period, particularly for those regions which were closest to the average. Even then, even with the new average, there will still most probably be, even looking at the maps provided in the report, which I urge you to examine carefully, extremely poor regions such as still exist in Spain, Portugal and Greece, and even in Italy, within the European Union of today. A solution, a largely financial solution, will have to be found for the band of intermediate regions, and what I am seeking to do is to ask the questions to obtain the help I need in order to find appropriate solutions when the time comes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question is quite simple. It is clear that enlargement will not just mean problems for the struggling regions which we are attempting to embrace in the Union. At the same time, if in this case the single market works, other regions will also reap the benefit. Now, in all honesty, I am a little concerned about this reasoning on averages, for it may be that the problem of income distribution will highlight regions which we could induce – although I do not know how – to contribute a little more to the overall financing of the system in view of the enlargement process. I therefore feel that it could well be appropriate to set rather more refined benchmarks for the cohesion policy and I continue to call for the implementation of the project to enlarge Europe to provide us with less rigid objectives and establish a more flexible scale, rather than necessarily tying us to this idea of a totally automatic process,<span class="bold"> </span>which sends the regions flying from category to category. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want us to discuss solidarity and to reach agreement on our political objectives. Thereafter, once we have agreed on the objectives and priorities and the line of approach, we must give ourselves the resources to carry them forward. So, discussing the money involved at this stage would be a poor way of opening the discussion. I know perfectly well that we shall have to discuss finance when the time comes. That is my first point. My second point is solidarity. We must continue to promote solidarity between States. You are well aware that there are States that are net contributors and others that are not. I therefore feel that this form of redistribution is quite fair and quite efficient. Thirdly, I must thank you for stating in your initial speech that enlargement entails problems and risks but also provides opportunities. This is also my view. If you look at developments over the last twenty years, with Spain, Portugal and Greece, my own personal conviction – and I never miss the opportunity to say so in the public debates I take part in – is that in the medium and long term, any enlargement process ultimately contains more opportunities than risks and problems. Quite apart from morality and politics, it is just not in our interests to allow people living on our doorstep to continue to live in poverty. Poverty, of the kind we have right next door to us, as in the countries of Eastern Europe or Albania or the Balkan states, always leads to the same outcome. When people do not have enough to eat, they emigrate. People living in poverty are prey to all sorts of nationalist conflicts, war, trafficking, and mafia exploitation. It is therefore in our own interest, quite apart from moral or political concerns, to undertake this enlargement and to pay the price for sharing progress. I must also thank you for giving me this opportunity to say that this debate must also prove that in the great challenge of enlargement there are more opportunities than risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with other MEPs, I have just attended the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, where it was clearly shown that with the problem of globalisation we are entering a new era, in which the European Union must play a fundamental role in the world. This problem of world social balance must form part of our economic policy and, since you referred to it, I would like to ask you what the European Union is going to do in this respect, because this is clearly going to have an influence on our internal economic problems and also on our budgetary problems.</p>

I shall, however, remain at your service, as you know, in the weeks and months to come in order to continue this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cunha, if you read the report, you will see that we actually say that the CAP, whose objectives are production, export capacity and sufficiency, has not actually become involved in the way we might have hoped in this territorial cohesion policy, particularly because, in the regions likely to benefit from cohesion policy, farm sizes are that much more modest. I have, therefore, myself, stressed the fact that we should, as I said earlier, improve synergy through the common agricultural policy. One of the means to do so would perhaps be, in future, to boost the emphasis on the rural development arm of the CAP, which was started in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Darras, I do not believe that we shall need to renegotiate the Financial Perspective in the matter of cohesion policy. The plans made in Berlin seem to me perfectly adequate. In anticipation, we even made provision for 2002, and now it is quite clear that no new countries will join in either 2002 or 2003. Sufficient sums were set aside to cope with these accessions, and so I do not think we shall need a new Financial Perspective. You mention changing the criteria, if necessary. We might continue to discuss possibilities, Mrs Darras, but I should like to point out that we are not too far off the real situation when we work on the basis of the standard of living, of per capita GDP, because it can be observed that where there is the lowest standard of living there is also the highest rate of unemployment, the worst environmental conditions, and the lowest levels of Internet access. Thus, in some way, taking a snapshot of the per capita standard of living, we have produced an accurate snapshot of the real state of the regions – and indeed it is no mere accident that my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, and all the other Members of Parliament who have given some thought to these questions all agreed on this criterion. Now, you know we can combine this criterion with other aspects, especially unemployment, but I would like us to retain this criterion as I think it an objective one.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nogueira, I do not have sufficient time to take part in a debate on globalisation. I even, as you identified earlier, mentioned the new context of cohesion policy associated with globalisation, which constitutes the risk which Jacques Delors and others clearly identified fifteen years ago, and which impelled them to propose this cohesion policy. In the same single market, there is a risk that wealth, trade and people will continue to be concentrated in the same locations and that the poorest regions are impoverished and marginalised further. That risk in the single market is exacerbated in a Europe living in an age of globalisation. That is why I think we do indeed need a cohesion policy and support for cohesion in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rack, yes, I am willing to look into new methods with you, particularly as far as development of the new Objective 2 policy is concerned. I wonder, for example, about the sense and usefulness of the Brussels-driven zoning for Objective 2, in which I am required to officially specify, in agreement with the Member States, whether every individual district, community or village is or is not to receive Objective 2 status. I do not think that all this bureaucracy is particularly useful, and that is why Objective 2 policy, concerning regions other than the most underdeveloped, could be simpler and more decentralised, with instruments subordinated to Community policies or to regional development, the urban areas, mountainous regions, island regions, border regions or cross-sector objectives such as social cohesion and the fight against poverty. I am perfectly willing to look into developing instruments which are decentralised in terms of their administration within the Member States and which do not convey the impression of excessive bureaucracy that the people of Europe sometimes have.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Torres Marques, I cannot go any further than I already have on the subject of the Financial Perspective. I have not forgotten the outermost regions; I even mentioned them in my opening remarks. There is a specific paragraph on these regions. As Mr Prodi requested, I do a great deal of work for these seven outermost regions. This is why, a few weeks ago, the Commission published an important report on adjustments or exceptions in the field of structural aid, and aid for agriculture and fisheries which, overall, have been well received by the authorities in these outermost regions and I think that, pursuant to Article 299 of the Treaty, we must continue to have a special policy for these outermost regions precisely because they are our outermost regions and, as such, our most remote active frontiers in the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic or near the American continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hedkvist-Petersen, thank you for pointing out the importance of the term ‘solidarity’. I also consider it important. The title that we wanted to give this report, ladies and gentlemen, is “European Unity, solidarity between nations, regional diversity”, and, as you will see when you read it in detail, I was careful to stress – since this was a concern of mine – the need to coordinate Community policies with regional development and cohesion, particularly in terms of research or the social agenda while noting that Member States and national governments will, of course, retain their jurisdiction on social policy. I am working within the scope of the Community’s current jurisdiction.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
