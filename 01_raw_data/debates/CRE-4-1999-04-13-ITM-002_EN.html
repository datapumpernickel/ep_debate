<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Happart </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am today presenting my final report to this House as I will be standing down at the elections on 13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be returning to southern Belgium to continue my work of promoting European construction in other ways. We need Europe and our children even more so.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the 1992 reform of the common agricultural policy, the report on agricultural prices was one of the most sought‐after and most prestigious reports. Although this has now lost its attraction, the prices for agricultural products still form the bulk of farmers" income, providing between 60 % and 80 % depending on the types of product.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention with these proposals to adjust agricultural prices is to send a clear message to the European farming community. I want to assure them that this House intends to defend their legitimate interests at a particularly difficult time when doubt is creeping in among farmers, particularly the younger ones.</p>
<p class="contents">We are increasingly telling our farmers about the necessary enlargement of the European Union and they are not against this. Some have already set up in the new areas, mainly in Poland. However, they do not want the farming community to have to foot the bill for this enlargement. They are prepared to make the necessary effort and sacrifices as citizens of Europe, like everyone else, but only to a fair and equal degree.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am talking about adjustment and not increase. Is it a crime to compensate for the loss of 1.9 % due to the changeover from the green ecu to the euro? Is it a crime to include farmers when compensating for the inflation rate of 1.9 % given that other European workers are justifiably benefiting from this compensation? For example, I am very happy for the German steel workers who have obtained a 4 % wage increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must ignore the Council of Ministers and the national governments which only want to recover the unspent amounts in order to help balance their domestic budgets. In addition, the richest of these governments want this money in order to partially renationalise their agriculture, with blatant disregard for farmers in the poorest Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council had at least had the courage to refinance the Structural Funds by transferring the budget allocations, farmers could have been bailed out. What hope can we give and what jobs can we offer for the future to the 200 000 farmers leaving the profession every year in Europe? Between 500 and 600 farmers are leaving farming every day, with this figure reaching over 3 000 per week in certain areas. The desertification of the countryside due to the farmers" exodus is killing the rural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">If we cannot save the rural society of the poorest regions today, what will we do tomorrow when the USA, having imposed on us its dollar bananas and hormonised meat, forces us to abandon these areas in the name of the World Trade Organisation?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want a society ‘made in the USA" for my children, where money is more important than people. I want the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not adjust these prices and provide the necessary refinancing of the Structural Funds, we will destroy the individuality of European agriculture where diversity goes hand in hand with quality.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jové Peres </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission"s proposal amounts to minor modifications of the COM in fresh fruit and vegetables and the processing of citrus fruits.</p>
<p class="contents">Where fresh fruit and vegetables are concerned, it is proposed to meet the cost of selecting and packing products to be distributed free of charge from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, if what is involved is providing an alternative to the withdrawal and distribution of products, free distribution should not become burdensome to the producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has proposed authorising members of producer organisations to sell part of their produce outside the commercial circuits of the producer organisation to which they belong.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the 1996 reform, most of the instruments designed to regulate the market were replaced by producer organisations" operating funds. The producer organisations play a central role in the COM and it is essential to avoid any modification of the regulations which might weaken them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed making it easier for members of recognised producer organisations to sell a limited part of their produce direct to the consumer. We might wonder how a producer organisation can regard as a right the abandonment of its main purpose – marketing its members" produce.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, direct sales have been severely restricted and can only take place on the producer"s farm. This approach could have a negative effect on the main role of producer organisations – marketing their members" produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Although current regulations ought to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to local situations, there is no justification for jeopardising the general system in order to comply with local practice which is far removed from areas where the bulk of the Community"s production of fruit and vegetables is concentrated. In such cases, it would seem wiser to resort to subsidiarity and to allow each Member State to regulate local practice as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to avoid undermining the main purpose of producer organisations, any exemption should be accompanied by a tightening of the limits on the amount of its members" produce that can be marketed outside the producer organisation so as to offset the producer organisation"s loss of marketable production.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the production of citrus fruits for processing, the present system leads to serious delays in the receipt of aid. In the case of citrus fruits processed at the start of the season, aid sometimes arrives twelve months later. The anticipatory scheme only partly compensates for these delays and some producer organisations are likely to be tempted to stop handing over their production for processing and to opt instead for the withdrawal arrangements. The Commission has come up with an appropriate proposal to resolve this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid has been granted for the processing of citrus fruits since 1976, and in the intervening period it has proved necessary to correct and prevent interference between the withdrawal scheme and the processing scheme. Great care should be taken when setting the conditions for aid to processing in order to prevent withdrawal from becoming a more attractive option than processing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal does not resolve the imbalance between the thresholds set for the processing of citrus fruits and production reality. This situation could result in the processing of citrus fruits becoming less profitable than withdrawal. An increase in withdrawals would have a negative effect on the environment and public opinion would be much more strongly opposed to it than it would be to aid to processing.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of balance between the commitment appropriations and the actual payments highlights the imbalance between the instruments for the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables. Following reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables, a surplus in commitment appropriations of ECU 400 million over payments was recorded. Yet the thresholds set for processed citrus fruits have resulted in chronic inadequacies in budget allocations. It is therefore proposed to increase the threshold to the average quantities processed in the last four years. An additional expenditure of ECU 64 million would be involved. This figure falls well within the financial margin of expenditure not incurred for withdrawals.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause of destabilisation of the system is the lack of a penalty limit. A 20 % limit on penalties should be set. In this connection, it is worth remembering that such a system existed in the past and is indeed still applied to other regulated produce subject to thresholds.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fantuzzi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I wholeheartedly welcome this proposal for a regulation on measures to promote agricultural products in third countries. It is a sign that, despite all the difficulties and uncertainties over reform of the CAP following the agreements reached in Berlin, some important and innovative moves are afoot. It is also a sign that agricultural products are in need nowadays not so much of policies to defend and protect them but of aggressive, innovative policies to promote them judiciously on third countries' markets.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often – not least in this House – we have heard talk of globalisation as though it merely meant net losses for European agriculture. This initiative puts us back on the right track: globalisation also offers unique opportunities for European agriculture. After all, there is growing demand in the world for high‐quality farm produce and food, and the EU has the highest standards of food, safety and quality in the world. Therefore we should not stand on the sidelines hoping for the best, but should equip ourselves with the appropriate instruments and strategies to be competitive and to make the most of this growth in demand around the world for high‐quality agri‐food products.</p>
<p class="contents">Flooding world markets with low added‐value commodities is the wrong approach, since it will be increasingly difficult to compete on such commodities with countries whose costs are lower than our own; furthermore, as we are aware, the WTO has placed both volume and value‐based ceilings on export refunds; and lastly, we know that the new Millennium Round talks are to begin soon and should not have too many illusions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Commissioner, we might get into hot water over these issues and make our presence felt rather late in the day. I see from the budget of the US Department of Agriculture that, in the three years from 1996 to 1999, over USD 150 million per year was spent on policies to support the internationalisation of agriculture. Of course, some promotional work has already been done in the EU – geared likewise to non‐European countries – in the general context of promotion activities, the most outstanding in recent years being support for the IOOC initiative to promote olive oil on world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with four points. The first is that this should be an opportunity to bring together and integrate all the promotional measures, not just those geared to external markets, but also those relating to the European internal market. Too many fragmentary initiatives have been devised with different motives, timing and procedures, and this opportunity should be taken to put them all into some kind of order.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that a budget increase is required. If this initiative is to be a serious one, it cannot be restricted to EUR 15 million – a derisory sum – and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed that, for 2000 to 2003, the funding should be boosted from EUR 30 m to 50 m. By the same token, the funding for all the promotional activities scheduled under Agenda 2000, limited to EUR 100 m from now until 2006, may be inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that a more long‐term view is needed. It is no accident that we have proposed extending from two to three years the period for revising the list of products to fall under the promotional measures and the duration of the programmes, in order to lend greater certainty and effectiveness to the measures. My fourth and final point is that the basic principle behind this regulation should be adhered to, namely subsidiarity and complementarity, in order that initiatives are not imposed from Brussels in a clean sweep but that they complement, blend with and in turn stimulate similar measures devised by the national authorities and by producers' associations, so that all the players involved in European agriculture and in its future challenges are following the same approach.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Miranda de Lage </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, in the explanatory statement of the opinion I am privileged to present to you today, the REX Committee has indicated that, in its view, the Commission"s proposal is very important and represents a great opportunity. The reform of the common agricultural policy in the framework of Agenda 2000 ought indeed to include a package of external measures providing for the development of actions to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Such actions must be aimed at increasing the competitiveness of European products on the world markets, and to this end, it is essential to promote their image. Information and publicity ought to result in good outlets for quality Community products with regulated designations of origin, particularly when countries with stringent quality requirements are targeted. These countries usually have high purchasing power.</p>
<p class="contents">The present initiative is particularly timely as the results of the campaign to promote olive oil and fibre flax, to which Mr Fantuzzi also referred, are already available. Sales of these products outside the Community have increased thanks to ad hoc methods of promotion. The proposal, which has been amended by the Committee on Agriculture, lists a whole range of possible actions. Nevertheless, the best publicity will always be the quality, safety, hygiene, labelling and respect for the environment that are characteristic of Community products.</p>
<p class="contents">The REX Committee is certainly in favour of this proposal and believes that it merits consideration. Nevertheless, as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out, there are some grounds for concern as to whether such an ambitious project can be adequately financed through the annual sum of only EUR 15 million allocated to it until the year 2003. In view of the large sums allocated to the CAP, there could well be scope for an increase in funding. If wisely managed, this would enable our exports to grow in an increasingly globalised international trading environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, by reiterating that the REX Committee supports this proposal. The committee is particularly in favour of the principle on which the proposal is based, namely, strengthening the Union"s commercial policy through the promotion of agricultural products in third countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colino Salamanca </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. – (ES)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should like to put an oral question concerning the present state of the market for garlic.</p>
<p class="contents">This is certainly not a new situation. It is a recurring problem, but I feel it is important to draw attention to it, particularly as unofficial imports of garlic from third countries are directly responsible for the collapse of the garlic market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should reiterate that this is not a new situation, and the reason for putting this question now is that in accordance with Regulation No 1137/98 of 29 May, the period in which import licences may be granted for a maximum of 12 000 tonnes of garlic from China is due to expire on 31 May. According to the figures I have available, total imports for 1998 total approximately 50 000 tonnes, though average imports for the European Union in the period 1990‐1997 were only of the order of 40 000 tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surprising to find references to countries such as Malaysia – which did not export any garlic to the European Union in 1993 – Jordan and India suddenly appearing. The figures of 7 300 tonnes, 6 167 tonnes and almost 1 000 tonnes respectively for 1998 are quoted, over and above the nominal 12 000 tonnes from China. This immediately gives rise to suspicions that triangular operations may be taking place involving garlic of Chinese origin which arrives here following deals with third countries. As a result, the quota and safeguard procedures are becoming meaningless. The situation has been further aggravated by the failure to insist on certificates of origin for imported garlic and by the failure to apply the appropriate tariff codes correctly to differentiate between green garlic with undeveloped cloves and garlic to be sold dried or partly dried.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that the Commission needs to be reminded that this particular crop is of great social significance in certain areas: it is produced mainly in regions with structural problems – Objective 1 regions. It should also be borne in mind that in addition to adopting the set of measures applied to date, there is a need for further measures, and the possibility of aid to rural development could be floated. What is at issue is a fall in production in areas such as Castile‐La Mancha, Castile‐Leon and Andalusia, which are all Objective 1 regions. Their economic activity revolves around this product as it represents the only means of making a living in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Documents produced by the Commission reveal that it is aware of the problem. For instance, Regulation No 1197 states that, since 1993, the Commission has noted a significant increase in imports of garlic from China relative to previous years. As far as I am aware, the cost of producing garlic in the European Union is of the order of 220 pesetas per kilo whereas Chinese garlic is priced at around 135 pesetas per kilo. Clearly, the ensuing fall in the price of garlic could cause a significant upheaval in the Community market. Indeed, this is already happening.</p>
<p class="contents">In Regulation No 544, the Commission states that following the introduction of a safeguard clause relating to the import of garlic from China, a significant increase in imports of garlic from certain third countries with no tradition of exporting garlic to the Community has suddenly taken place over the last few years. The Commission itself has suggested that this raises doubts as to the true origin of the garlic imported from these third countries. Imports of garlic of dubious origin have continued to increase.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this data provided by the Commission itself and since the market is collapsing, it is essential to put pressure on the Commission to take action to remedy the situation. Given that the Commission is aware of the situation and that it is also aware that the measures taken so far are inadequate – as the state of the market proves – it is simply not acceptable that no further measures are being taken. The garlic producers have raised the possibility of setting a maximum world trading quota, and of even setting a deterrent tariff barrier for quantities above this maximum world trading quota.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that these issues will be dealt with during future negotiations. We would, however, urge the Commission to remain vigilant and to introduce appropriate measures to prevent the annual drop in producers" incomes. I should emphasise once again that their income has been falling year on year since 1993.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to express my support for the reports by Mr Jové and Mr Fantuzzi, particularly as regards the processing of citrus fruits and aid for the promotion of agricultural products in third countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to bear with me if what I have to say takes some time, but I do now have to comment on four different reports. I should like to start straight away with the price proposals for the 1999/2000 marketing year.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals which the Commission has made are in line with the same stability policy which has already been pursued in preceding price packages. They are primarily intended to guarantee the rollover which is necessary for legal reasons. The reform will in any case mean that in future, far fewer market management parameters will need to be set on an annual basis. Under these circumstances, the Commission is proposing not to increase the amounts. I believe that we should confine ourselves strictly to measures which do not run counter to the overall strategy agreed in Berlin. At this point, I should also like to thank Mr Happart very much for his report, along with the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the members of the other committees who were actively involved in the preparatory work for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will now turn to the amendments. I will begin with those which seek to increase all the prices and aids so as to take account of the inflation rate of 1.9 % and the introduction of the euro. This concerns the following groups of amendments: firstly, Amendments Nos 13, 16, 23, 33, 38 and 42 on the rate of inflation; then Amendments Nos 14, 17, 24, 34 and 39 on the introduction of the euro; and finally, Amendments Nos 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27 to 31, 36 and 41 on raising prices. The Commission cannot agree to these amendments, because they would run directly counter to the need to improve the competitiveness of Community produce, both in the internal market and on the world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this would involve additional expenditure of EUR 463 million for the year 2000. If that is applied to the forthcoming financial framework from 2000 to 2006, the additional costs come to over EUR 3 billion. Finally, this would also mean that we would be unable to honour our international commitments in full, that is those on reducing internal support.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, Council Regulation No 2799/98 on the new agri‐monetary arrangements provides in any case that if there is proven loss of income as a result of the introduction of the euro, then compensatory payments may be granted, provided that the conditions specified are met.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 1 on compulsory set‐aside, which amounts to keeping the set‐aside rate as it currently stands for the coming years, I should like to point out that part of the Berlin compromise is that a basic set‐aside rate of 10 % should apply for the whole of the period from 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 concerns flax and hemp and aims to promote the use of these agricultural products for non‐food purposes. I understand the reasons behind this amendment. But I cannot agree to it, because this issue needs to be considered in a wider context. It will also need to be taken into account when the future set‐aside rate and the options for rural development measures are discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 and 5 seek to introduce new measures to manage pigmeat production. I should simply like to draw your attention here to the fact that subsidising the pig sector at the present time will only compound the problem, because farmers will be less willing to reduce the size of their herds. Implementing a proposal of this kind would also be very costly. Incidentally, I might also point out here that in the management committee we have repeatedly invited the Member States to make structural proposals. We have discussed all the variants which have been mentioned here. The Member States did not find a single one of these attractive, and stated on the contrary that appropriate market management was a sufficient measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the amendments relating to the wine sector. Amendments Nos 3 and 32 on the granting of permanent abandonment premiums in respect of wine‐growing areas and extending the deadline for submitting applications for premiums for the 1999/2000 marketing year from 31 December 1999 to 31 March 2000 do not cause any difficulties. However, the Commission is unable to accept the remaining amendments on the wine sector for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this will either pre‐empt the reform – which has been agreed at political level – or might even go against it. Secondly, as regards the ban on planting new areas under vines, I might point out that this was extended in the last price package until 31 August 2000, and that in 1998 an additional 10 000 hectares of planting rights had to be granted for both the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 marketing years. The Commission cannot agree to the other Amendments Nos 26 and 31 on the monthly reimbursement of storage costs for sugar, simply because the proposed reduction is indisputably due to the fall in interest rates. In the light of the new timetable for the reform of the common organisation of the markets in the milk sector, Amendment No 35 is unjustified.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the three amendments on the beef and veal sector, Amendments Nos 37, 40 and 41, I would point out that they are unnecessary in view of the proposals to reform this sector. In conclusion, I would ask you to bear in mind that while we are waiting for Agenda 2000 to be implemented, we should on no account lose sight of the fact that underlying these price proposals are efforts to achieve greater simplification and stability which are reinforced by the broad consensus in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the report Mr Happart has presented today is his last, I wish to thank him very much and, Mr Happart, you can take this assurance with you for your continued political career: for as long as I work here, I will not allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture, but like you will fight for us to retain our independence in Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the report on a number of adjustments to the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables. As you know, this is only the second marketing year that this new market organisation has been in force, and you also know that in any case it is intended to carry out a general review of the way this market organisation is operating next year. This being the case, I think it is too early for us to make more far‐reaching changes than the ones proposed at this stage. During the recent negotiations on the price package, however, the Commission did agree to make a few minor adjustments so as to improve the way in which the market organisation operates. That alone is therefore the aim of these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Jové Peres for his report, in which he also registers a large degree of support for the Commission"s proposals. Like him, I too believe that it is necessary to strengthen the producer organisations, on which the major burden of market management clearly falls. Mr Peres also refers to a number of problems which we will have to deal with during the forthcoming review. The Commission therefore believes that many of the proposed amendments are premature and would not appear to be feasible without a detailed analysis. This applies to Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 to 9. I can assure Parliament, however, that the Commission will pay careful attention to these points when it reviews the market organisation next year. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 5, because the producer organisations need to have the financial and technical capability to monitor their products appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to Mr Fantuzzi"s report. Here too, my particular thanks go to the rapporteur, but also to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the other committees which have given their opinions on this proposal. I am glad that the proposal has met with broad support. The aim of the proposal is to create an operational instrument which will increase the international competitiveness of European agricultural products. We must certainly not – and here I agree with Mr Fantuzzi – stand by and watch while our most important competitors in the new markets – such as those in south‐east Asia and Latin America – pursue an active policy of export promotion, when we have nothing even remotely equivalent to set against it. We will therefore have to make considerable efforts in this field in the future and develop a wide range of information and promotional measures so as to consolidate our position in these markets, particularly because European products are as a rule highly processed and that can only mean that jobs are also at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will observe the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity and will essentially confine itself to acting as a link or as a catalyst and ensuring European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we can only take action within our limited budget, and we should also make use of the best available know‐how from outside. This approach therefore requires the Member States – both the private and the public sector – to be heavily involved in terms of making cofinancing available and providing the necessary support for managing and monitoring the measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say the following on the proposed amendments: firstly, as far as the criteria for selecting the eligible products are concerned – this concerns Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6 and 9 – we believe that these amendments are superfluous because the Commission proposal already covers these points in a more general way. According to the Commission proposal, the products which can be selected are those which are intended for direct consumption or processing. In just the same way, organic products or products made using other specific production methods may be selected, as can processed foodstuffs, provided that the information and promotional measures are of sufficient benefit and are in the European interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the nature and content of the measures to be supported, I can accept Amendment No 7. The more precise statement of the target groups at which the measures should be directed, analysed in Amendment No 8, does not, however, seem to me to be necessary. As far as your proposed adjustments to the procedure for drawing up the list of products and the question of how long this should remain valid are concerned – this relates to Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 14 – this might pose problems if we still want our policy to be sufficiently flexible and if we also want to keep it up to date at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually think it would be better to consult the Standing Group on the Promotion of Agricultural Products – as it is called – from the very outset, if time allows, and also for the lists we draw up to remain valid for no longer than two years. Introducing such rigid rules, as proposed in the amendments, could prevent our policy from having the best possible effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Your proposal only to work with those organisations which represent exclusively the Member States of the European Union or to which at least two Member States belong is not one I can accept, because we also attach great importance to working with international organisations, which of course have to show an appropriate European dimension. You only have to think of the work of the Olive Oil Council. As regards the obligation to consult the relevant management committee rather than simply to inform it, I am willing to examine this proposal in more detail. I have to reject the remaining points, however, because our experience has shown that programmes should not run for longer than three years, and because when we implement this scheme we want to adopt a bottom‐up approach. In addition, the professional organisations have to obtain the prior agreement of the national authorities before they submit their proposals to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the proposer organisations may also appoint bodies to be responsible for implementing the planned measures. It must be clear, however, that these bodies must be selected on the basis of an invitation to tender at Community level. I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 4, 15, 19 and 24 on the tendering procedure, because the Commission believes that external support facilities must be selected on the basis of an invitation to tender, so as to ensure maximum transparency of Community interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that the Member States should have sole responsibility for monitoring and making payments, in so far as measures are to be prefinanced by them. On your request to show more flexibility when determining the part of the funding to be paid by the Member States and in certain cases not to require any financial contribution at all – this is expressed in Amendments Nos 22 and 21 – I should like to say that I think that the Commission proposal is more balanced here in terms of the financial contributions of the three parties involved, namely the Community, the Member State and the proposer organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the proposal to increase the appropriations, as contained in Amendment No 22, I should like to say that a substantial increase would not be acceptable at the present time because the sums spent on export refunds are in no way linked to the promotion policy, since the proposal we are discussing primarily concerns quality products and products displaying high added value. But obviously here the ultimate decision rests with the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the comments made by Mr Colino Salamanca concerning imports of garlic from third countries. The Commission is currently investigating the possibilities open to it within the WTO for resolving the problems in the garlic sector and is also preparing to introduce a new system which provides for an appropriately high rate of duty on all garlic imports, with the exception of imports falling within the proposed tariff quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with GATT rules, quotas would have to be set on the basis of average imports from third countries over a previous three‐year period and allow for an appropriate annual increase. A draft recommendation for a Council decision authorising the Commission to hold negotiations with the third countries concerned about this change in the bound rate of duty is currently being prepared. In the meantime, as an initial measure, the safeguard clause, which exists in principle and which we have applied in recent years, is being further extended. Proposals have already been made on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I discussed both these possibilities in detail with representatives of the garlic industry a few weeks ago, and in principle they also gave the green light here and signalled their agreement.</p>

However, I believe this is justified when Commissioners have to reply to a number of reports which deal with many aspects of a subject, and because many important events have taken place in this area in recent times, not least in view of the interim agreement reached by the ministers and the decisions taken at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the House to let me depart from the standard practice of the Chair, so as to add my comments to what Mr Fischler has said on the departure of Mr Happart. For many years, Mr Happart has been one of the more lively elements in the European Parliament. Those of us who have followed his activities will feel very sad that he will not be with us next time. We wish him every success in his career and in his new political endeavours.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rehder </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, if I may, Commissioner, I will echo your words of farewell to Mr Happart. The fact is – and this is one of our colleague"s attributes – that those who swim against the tide sometimes introduce rather more oxygen into the water. That is what Mr Happart has done throughout his long and successful career here.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, where expenditure is concerned, soundness, financial stability and continuity are of great importance, and in recent years – we can almost go back to the beginning of the European Union – they have not always been valued as much as we in the European Parliament, as representatives of the taxpayer, would have liked. One of the major successes of the Berlin summit was, for the first time in fact, to move this self‐evident truth to centre stage. That is a success. However, there is another side, a darker side, to almost every success, and in this case the politicians in the Member States are not yet aware of it. To be cautious about this, I should like to express it as follows: alongside this stability, social justice and solidarity with the weaker members of society must of course also be key features of this policy, not only at European level but also right down to each individual locality. One of the things which disappoints my group and me personally is that at the present time there is still no instrument – and this could have been decided on in Berlin – through which greater justice and a higher degree of solidarity with smaller and weaker farmers might be achieved. It is painful to observe that there is currently no instrument to prevent the old principle from applying whereby price increases mean that more is given to the rich, while all that remains for the poor are the crumbs which fall from the table. In fact, it is not so much pricing as extending the second pillar of the integrated policy in rural areas which can be one of the ways of really providing help, and not least an opportunity of moving into a different sector for those who are evidently exposed to risk as businessmen and farmers. This opportunity must also be open to their successors. That is our social democratic creed; that is what we believe to be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Although you also complimented Mr Jové Peres, Commissioner, I do have to say that his proposals are somewhat premature. Of course, Parliament often points the way ahead and some people – yourself excluded perhaps – then go down that road rather hesitantly. I hope, however, that the ideas which Mr Jové Peres has presented here today will actually also be translated into practical policy in the future. What this is really about – and in this respect all these reports belong together – is gradually dismantling this rigid market segment, this regulation down to every last detail, and going back to a free social market economy in the European Union. That is why it is obviously necessary to use our common sense to refocus the marketing initiatives undertaken very successfully by many producer groups in many countries of the European Union and to make it possible for them to sell anything they have that still needs to be sold. Only here too there is another side to the coin: it will not do for farmers to sell potatoes to the producer group when times are hard, and for them to distribute the potatoes on the open market when times are good and they can obtain a good price. That would mark the end of this help, this effective help of marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this is also about marketing. Mr Fantuzzi"s report also contains proposals to give greater support to marketing in the European Union. It is quite astonishing that when it comes to marketing, the economic giant of the European Union is still in its infancy and is faced with the task of trying, with a very small budget, to emulate the marketing pioneers and giants.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a robust marketing campaign here. Unfortunately, good things cost money. We need to build on what we have at regional level. The economic giant, the EU, has to be a marketing giant as well!</p>

I just want to say that I share the Commission"s disappointment about this reform, expressed at its first plenary meeting after the Berlin summit.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned at this meeting, the annual price packages were in the past the main instrument for defining agricultural policy. It is since the 1992 reform that the price packages have gradually ceased to be this policy‐defining instrument. This is due to Commissioner Fischler who, since the start of his term of office, has consistently advocated the desirability of the common agricultural policy being increasingly defined by medium‐term horizons. We now have this reform for 1999 before us in which, once again, agricultural policy is defined according to a medium‐term horizon, in this case of seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the future the price packages will basically be used to adjust agricultural policy measures during the medium‐term horizon. With regard to this 1999‐2000 price package, it is clear to everyone that this has no role to play in defining agricultural policy. It is only a bridge between the past and the future, a transitional measure preserving the status quo until the new CAP is applied at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to have any sense of responsibility, there is therefore no point in proposing new measures, in particular price increases, when the Agriculture Council has just unanimously reduced these same prices within Agenda 2000. If the European Parliament were now to approve these measures, quite frankly it would lose its credibility. The PPE Group cannot therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Happart nor those tabled by other Members in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must congratulate Mr Happart on some of his analyses which are apposite, particularly with regard to the pigmeat sector. I also want to thank him for all his work and cooperation with us during his time in this House. I wish him every personal and political success in the future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Olsson </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to join in thanking Mr Happart. I think he has been a good friend to agriculture and the countryside and many others share my view, even if I do not always see eye to eye with him. Instead, I support the Liberals on this issue, in other words the Commission's proposal for the most part rather than the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Berlin summit, the immediate future for farmers in terms of agricultural policy looks brighter than the Commission had previously envisaged. However, there are a few points I should like to raise. In making savings, agriculture should not be the target of any economies that are required as a condition for eastward enlargement. The countryside, agriculture and other neglected areas should never have to pay for enlargement; it should fall to those sectors which can best afford it. For the same reason, there should be no renationalisation of agriculture. Until there is a fully functioning global market, the CAP needs to be safeguarded. And there is a strong likelihood that it will be some time before the market functions reliably.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr Fischler's comments to the effect that European agriculture should not become Americanised. However, we should be aware that in the slightly longer term, the significance of the market and competition will increase. As a result, European agriculture will have to become more efficient in terms of quantity and possibly even more so as regards quality. In this context, I should like to say that what emerges from Mr Fantuzzi's report about endeavouring to increase sales is constructive. Agriculture should be something that Europe can rely on, and we should be able to feel confident about its capacity to provide food products that will be profitable in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must give the right signals to farmers. We should lose no time in initiating a discussion on a more far‐reaching reform of our agriculture and rural policies, not on the grounds of enlargement, but because it is needed. It is time to make changes which will last well beyond the year 2006.</p>

In one sense this agreement is positive as, due to the mobilisation of farmers and the rural world, the Heads of State and Government refused to apply the extreme ultraliberal measures prepared by the Commission. However, on the whole, the European leaders did not abandon the logic of allowing agricultural prices to fall, as imposed by the major European and international economic and financial operators.</p>
<p class="contents">This logic can be seen in the Commission"s regulation on prices for agricultural products. This regulation does not even guarantee that prices will be maintained in line with inflation or will compensate for the abandonment of the green ecu. It also does not correct the imbalances occurring between products and between producers. This logic of allowing prices to fall can also be seen in the lack of determination and means to defend products such as garlic which is the victim of practices which contravene our regulations. Yet this is a vital product for employment in the European production areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need a policy to promote our agricultural products, provided that this has adequate financial resources, unlike the current proposals. It does not take a genius to predict that the logic of allowing agricultural prices to fall, as adopted in Berlin, will perpetuate a system of production which destroys employment, food quality and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the introduction of some negative measures in the CAP reform is to be staggered, which gives farmers, rural dwellers and the people of Europe time to demand that the CAP be genuinely reoriented in the direction defined by this House. This is even more of a possibility as we move towards the European elections which will give the people the chance to take part in the debate and decisions. I believe there is still work to be done on the CAP reform and the content of this policy can and must be reformed.</p>

He has always defended production and naturally does not always submit to the limitations imposed by financial policy. Obviously, this view of general stability may seem outrageous and blasphemous but I understand and support it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the 1992 reform, which was based on historical production rates, created a sharp difference in aid throughout Europe, particularly between rich Europe and poor Europe. There is no doubt that the ‘compensation aid", which will now be called ‘direct aid", does not compensate for the fall in prices. There is no doubt that farmers are earning less, except in the case of industrialised agriculture. I do not therefore feel that Mr Happart"s proposal is so outrageous or so blasphemous. It is a normal proposal from someone who is trying to defend producers as well as consumers. My group therefore supports the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Jové Peres says in his report is extremely important. It is particularly essential to maintain the balance between producer organisations and producers and to guarantee that the latter can remain faithful to their organisations without this constituting a kind of controlled economy in which they are forced, like slaves, to sell to poorly managed organisations. The main problem facing us is how to ensure the proper management of these organisations and, at the same time, meet the needs of producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree more on the subject of withdrawal. This often provides a large profit because it is frequently implemented fraudulently in that payment is made for products to be withdrawn which are then sold on external markets. I have seen this happen!</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of products as indicated in the Fantuzzi report is extremely important. We have been asking for this for ages and it clearly seems ridiculous that Europe has not taken a more aggressive stance given the gradual loss of our international markets. For example, Portugal has lost the olive oil market in Brazil to products of terrible quality against which we can easily compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, garlic is a normal problem. We believe that, in view of the organised crime and laundering which the Commission has allowed in recent years, in this case strict control would solve the problem. There is a desire to control what we import.</p>

Are you paying him a compliment, or can it be that you are happy with Berlin? I am becoming rather confused, because in his report Mr Happart did in fact pin his hopes on Agenda 2000 being implemented. It seems to me that the hopes which Mr Happart expressed in his report have not been realised. In this report on prices, he is still referring to the 1992 reform, and you are well aware – and have said so yourself in your documents and reports on Agenda 2000 – that the 1992 reform led to cases of severe injustice and showed a serious failure to take due account of employment and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that most of the money goes to well‐situated production areas and not to less‐favoured areas. You know that most of the money goes to larger holdings and that some large holdings have the premiums paid straight into a time deposit account, because the prices and their advanced stage of rationalisation mean that they can manage without them. You know that there are premiums in the maize sector which have no environmental conditions attached. You know that pasture land is also one of the economically marginalised areas. None of this was rectified in Berlin. That is why I really must take it as a compliment when you say that it runs counter to Berlin. We should actually start work straight away on developing a new strategy for safeguarding agriculture, not least on the regional market.</p>
<p class="contents">Time does not allow me to say any more on this, but you are familiar with my views. I should also like to comment on sales promotion. Here I believe, Commissioner Fischler, that we must not allow sales promotion to become export subsidies by the back door; this must be genuine sales promotion. I think that the internal market should also be taken into account here, which means making money available on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that you were against regulating the pig market, Mr Fischler. I fully agree with you that we should not intervene here, but if intervention is not wanted here, then why are we keeping it in the other markets? If it works so well there, then we should have it in the pig market too. I see that you are not pleased. That makes me very happy.</p>

His work has always been efficient and consistent and he has also sometimes acted as a necessary irritant to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to his report, the Commission"s proposal to leave agricultural prices unchanged for the next season has come at a time when agricultural income has fallen considerably in certain Member States, which the Commission acknowledges. We therefore clearly understand the rapporteur"s amendments which aim to adjust prices in line with the rate of inflation and in particular to compensate for the negative effects of a new agri‐monetary system resulting from the changeover to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understood the Commissioner"s position just now. However, we will support the rapporteur"s proposal on two express conditions. Firstly, the price adjustment must apply to all agricultural products and not just cereals, sugar and beet, butter and skimmed‐milk powder and adult bovine animals. Secondly, the increase resulting from this proposal must benefit the 80 % of farmers who are the most disadvantaged. This is the aim of my amendment to the recitals which I have tabled on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Fantuzzi"s report, this proposal is much more important than it seems at first sight. In view of the changes in the world agricultural trade, it is clearly imperative that the European Union implements a common action policy to promote and provide information on its products in third countries. In order to sell our products, and to sell them well, as shown by the specific case of olive oil, Europe must be united and must develop its own model of agriculture. Its products must focus on quality, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of land and farmers. Given that our main commercial competitor – the United States of America – spends approximately EUR 140 million per year on promotion, not to mention indirect aid, the Commission"s proposal to allocate EUR 15 million to the promotion of agricultural products is derisory. This is why we support the rapporteur"s proposal to increase this figure to EUR 50 million between now and 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the positions which I have always defended with my group and with other Members in order to make our European model of agriculture consistent and real, it is vital that the amendments are supported as they are intended, first of all, to make the professional organisations and the Commission jointly responsible for implementing this promotion policy. Secondly, they are intended to monitor the use of funds by providing for post‐evaluation audits of spending in relation to objectives in order to judge their effectiveness and to reorient these funds if necessary. Thirdly and finally, they aim to include within this approach aid for the promotion of quality products, for example those originating from organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our group supports the report by Mr Jové Peres.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">des Places </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, a few days ago the Agriculture Committee decided that Mr Happart"s draft report on agricultural prices could not be adopted as it was. A few moments ago, Commissioner Fischler rejected outright all the amendments which could potentially alter the Berlin agreements. It should be remembered that these agreements were reached without the European Parliament giving an opinion on them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore nothing left for me to do but congratulate Mr Happart on having been willing and courageous enough to realistically attempt to defend the profitability of agricultural holdings. This is why, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, I participated in the tabling of amendments on an across‐the‐board increase in institutional prices and aid of 1.9 %. The aim of these amendments is to compensate for the effects of inflation and of the green ecu being abolished from 1 January 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I did in fact table these amendments last year when I was rapporteur on the price package. Like Mr Happart, I thought that the dual effect of inflation and the abolition of the green ecu would cause an unacceptable fall in prices for farmers given that we were also imposing constraints on them in terms of the environment, animal welfare, traceability and so on. The fall in prices and in agricultural compensation will end up forcing farmers towards greater intensification when all they want to do is balance their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these two sets of amendments, I have tabled amendments with Mr Chesa on wine‐growing. In anticipation of a future reform of COM 1, it is essential to set up the mechanisms specified in this in order to prevent any breakdown. These amendments involve extending the duration of planting rights, allowing planting in advance and providing for new planting rights in order to respond to market changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I deeply regret this situation which will unfortunately prevent a balance being achieved in European agriculture and between each Member State.</p>

Rather than concentrating on the issue of prices, on which we all agree with Mr Happart"s struggle, I wish to focus on an issue which I feel is symbolic in this joint discussion. This issue is garlic. It is symbolic not just because it is a product like olive oil or wine which is subject to replanting rights and not just because it is representative of an era of civilisation, but also because it serves to demonstrate, like honey and other products, what European construction is really about.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a well‐known issue. We produce garlic in Europe, in the Cuenca region of Castile in Spain and in the Drôme and Gers regions of France. This is quality garlic whose cultivation is ecological in two respects. Firstly it requires little water and secondly it can be grown in problem areas thereby helping to ensure that people remain in these areas. Our producers should therefore be protected by customs duties and controls. However, in addition to traditional imports from Egypt, Argentina and the United States, we also receive imports from China which has a quota of twelve thousand tonnes. Yet in reality thirty thousand tonnes are imported from China via countries involved in garlic fraud such as, dare I say, Malaysia – which sends us hundreds of tonnes without growing any itself – India, Jordan and a whole range of other third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the official and illegal Chinese garlic leaves China at 10 centimes per kilo. It arrives in Europe at 4.50 francs per kilo which is 0.70 euro, whereas our producers can only produce it for 10 francs per kilo which is approximately 1.5 euro. This garlic is then offered to consumers at 3 euro or 20 francs per kilo. In other words, our producers are facing unfair competition from garlic produced at half the cost, quite obviously by prisoners in labour camps.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission doing while all this is going on? It is considering referring the matter to the World Trade Organisation following on from its success in the banana dispute. No controls are being applied at the frontiers even though the Italians have shown that these can intercept the immigrant or, dare I say it, fraudulent garlic. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, who are involved in these illegal imports, are being allowed to continue. Customs duties are not being imposed whereas the United States applies 376 % customs duties to imported garlic.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the honey adulterated with sugar cane, beet or corn syrups and many other imports, we are allowing adulterated garlic to be imported which can be up to two years old, thus leading to germination problems. We are allowing our producers to be destroyed, as with the banana producers in Guadeloupe, the Canary Islands, Martinique and Madeira and our wine producers. Prices are falling and inflation is being ignored. This is what European construction is really about, Mr President and Commissioner. Once again, the circle of stars on the European Union flag is blinding us to a world trade involving leniency and fraud. This really is internationalism.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Iversen </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my disappointment at the outcome of the Berlin summit. It is difficult to discuss these matters without also seeing them in the light of what actually happened in Berlin. Compared with the Commission's proposal, which we supported, Berlin was in fact a disaster for European agriculture. Things we have been working on for a number of years were not completed, and prices were not cut sufficiently. I am unhappy about that. I agree with those who have expressed regret that Mr Happart will no longer be here, but I would also like to tell Mr Happart that unfortunately I disagree with him – as he is well aware – about this price proposal. It is clear that the idea behind the report was to ensure the best possible terms for farmers. But I believe we have to recognise the fact that we should have brought our agricultural prices down to a level which reflects the world market price, and so we will have to find other methods to compensate for the social distortion which may result.</p>
<p class="contents">Next I would like to say a few words about Mr Fantuzzi's report on measures to promote our agricultural products in third countries. This is an important area in connection with both Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming WTO negotiations. We are sympathetic towards the Commission's move, but we believe that the favouritism shown to the olive oil sector is untenable in relation to all the other products which we would also like to sell on the world market. To use 40 % of the budget on this sector is perhaps a little excessive. However, we cannot endorse the proposal on national cofinancing. I do not in fact consider it appropriate to have national cofinancing, because it entails a risk of differential treatment between countries and increases the trend towards a repatriation of common policies. That is why I believe that general promotional measures should be financed in full by the Union, and far more funding should be allocated for this than has been proposed by the Commission. We also support the rapporteur on this point. It is important for us to have an effective instrument to promote exports and react to US measures in this area. A fact which has also been pointed out by others in this debate is that the USA spends far more money on promoting exports than the Commission is planning to do here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, where more specific sales promotions are concerned, I think that the private companies and producer organisations involved should also participate in the financing.</p>

True to his record, he has once again presented us with a report which is not only technically accurate and thorough but also well balanced from a political point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes to Regulation No 2200/96 establishing the COM of the fruit and vegetable sector may initially appear minor, yet certain aspects of them do give cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">A central feature of the COM as it was set up in 1996 was the key role of the producer organisations in terms of both marketing their members" produce and regulating the markets financing withdrawal operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now proposing to allow members of producer organisations to sell part of their produce outside the commercial circuits of the producer organisations to which they belong.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the rapporteur that such authorisation – doubtless intended to ensure the survival of traditional practices – should not have a negative effect on the operation of the producer organisations. This is particularly critical when allowing direct sales both on the farm and elsewhere. Producers can directly access commercial circuits outside those of the producer organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament does not object to a certain amount of flexibility, but we must ensure that the main role of the producer organisations is not eroded. I therefore welcome the differentiated quantitative limits set by the rapporteur depending on whether the sales take place on the farm or elsewhere. I feel that these measures will ensure that the bulk of production continues to be marketed through the producer organisations. Exceptions will remain exceptions and will not become a general rule that weakens the system.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the modifications to Regulation No 2202/96 providing for aid to citrus fruit producers, the measures introduced by the Commission are indeed sorely needed to compensate for the delay in the receipt of aid. The Commission is therefore to be congratulated on dealing with the situation. Unfortunately, the Commission has failed to address the major shortcoming of the COM: the imbalance between the thresholds set for the processing of citrus fruits and production reality. This has resulted in significant increases in withdrawals given the heavy penalties incurred for exceeding the thresholds.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has suggested increasing the thresholds to the average amount processed during recent years. The financial implications are reasonable and could be covered under the COM"s financial statement. He has also suggested setting a 20 % limit on penalties. This could help to stabilise the future of the processing industry by preventing the producers from breaking their contracts and directing their produce to withdrawal which would naturally have a negative effect on the environment and the common dimension of the COM.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, if Mr Jové"s proposals prove to be reasonable and well balanced, and if there are no technical objections, there is no sense in waiting for an eventual reform of the COM. Instead, the proposals should be implemented immediately, taking advantage of the fact that these regulations are currently being reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, what is important is not where ideas come from but whether they are fundamentally sound. On this occasion, Mr Jové has presented us with significant alternatives which could easily be implemented in view of their low cost and sound technical basis.</p>

The official statistics prove that farmers now earn just over half of what they earned three years ago. This is the concrete and dramatic effect of the famous 1992 CAP reform on the weakest farming sector in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation should have been corrected by the European Council in Berlin but unfortunately was not, with the incredible acquiescence and even approval of the Portuguese Government. As a result of the Berlin agreement, prices will continue to fall, the weakest Mediterranean products and farmers will continue to be discriminated against and the smallest farmers in Portugal will continue to receive the scraps of the financial transfers allocated to Portugal. This means that less than 10 % of the cake will continue to be distributed to more than 90 % of those actually working the land.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the Berlin agreement, the big food industries, the large European farmers and the main cereal crops will continue to be favoured and to receive the lion"s share of the Community"s agriculture budget. The Berlin agreement is simply continuing the 1992 CAP reform which was not altered at the end of March when it should have been.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission is trying to bring forward the Berlin decisions and is proposing further price reductions for next season. We therefore feel it is useful to support the attempt by the rapporteur – who we congratulate – to block these reduction proposals, although we consider that the fair and across‐the‐board increase which he is proposing, despite applying to all sectors, will still not solve the existing discriminations.</p>
<p class="contents">I must briefly mention the pigmeat sector. It is clear that one of the reasons for the grave crisis which has affected and which is continuing to affect this sector has been the Commission"s refusal to establish market regulation and intervention mechanisms. These would over time have prevented the accumulation of such large surpluses. The Commission should draw the respective and requisite conclusions from this and accordingly not insist on, or even abandon, its proposals to abolish market intervention mechanisms in other agricultural sectors.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Poisson </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner, the price package for 1999/2000 is being fixed at a decisive time for the future of European agriculture when farmers" income is continuing to shrink. In 1997 and 1998, their income fell by 6.5 % overall. The fall in market prices which began in 1998 is continuing in 1999 and the prospects on the world market remain uncertain in some sectors. The abolition of the green rates and the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 have resulted in a fall of 1 % to 2 % in the agricultural conversion rates in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now clear that the Commission"s proposal on the price package is still paltry and gives farmers little room for manoeuvre. We must clearly reaffirm the benefits of agriculture in terms of the economy, self‐sufficiency in food production, which is its primary function, and occupation of the land. We must maintain a prosperous and successful agricultural sector and, in particular, we must prevent the disappearance of certain categories of farmers due to falling income. We must not allow agriculture to be taken over by bureaucracy due to an increase in public aid as this would restrict farmers" freedom of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Dare we say that European agriculture has a cost which cannot be reduced any further without calling into question our model of agriculture. Furthermore, European consumers benefit from this model because they are assured of quality products and a regular market supply. We have also been able to develop the products from our land and the products from organic farming. Our agri‐food industry also represents a high value added. In twenty years, the price of a metric quintal of wheat has fallen by 40 % whereas production costs have increased by 20 % and more in certain sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not difficult to understand why European farmers are worried about their futures. The European Union"s role is not to sacrifice its agriculture on the altar of enlargement or Americanisation but to allow our farmers to carry out their work and to have a standard of living equal to the average in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I will support Mr Happart"s amendments. I also wish him every success in his new work.</p>

<p class="contents">To some extent prices have very little effect on the farmer's actual future, because while we sit and talk about prices and say there will be no inflationary aspects, in the final analysis it is the actual income to the farmer that is important. If we look at statistics throughout Europe over the last two to three years, we can see that actual income to the farmer on the ground has dramatically dropped. Every year the income drops. The question we have to ask ourselves is how long can this continue? How long can agriculture sustain itself in this position?</p>
<p class="contents">The other question we have to ask is: will there be any future for the industry if young people do not continue to enter agriculture? That is the long‐term challenge. If we do not have young people coming into agriculture – young farmers beginning at the bottom of the ladder to work their way up – then in the longer term agriculture has no future, long‐term or short‐term. To some extent what we are involved in at the moment in Europe is short‐term policies that have no long‐term vision. We require long‐term vision for the future, for the future of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also areas within European agriculture that are not covered by any regime, such as the situation in the pig industry and the situation in the poultry industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We are allowing imports to come from third countries outside the European Union; we are allowing food to be imported into Europe that would not come near European standards. At the same time we are laying down standards, we are telling our farmers how they should produce food. We are tying farmers' hands behind their backs. Frozen chickens are being imported from Brazil and from the Far East. I challenge the Commission here today to tell us whether these chickens are being examined and whether they meet the same standards as we have? Our processors are being put at risk. This is why there is high unemployment. Our processors are being put out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">I challenge the Commission here today. Let us look at ourselves, let us not ask our farmers in Europe to produce food to a standard that others in the rest of the world cannot match.</p>

They are of course being discussed at this very moment. Small‐scale farmers have problems competing directly with factory farms overseas. I am favourably disposed towards the idea of selling more quality products from European agriculture on the world markets by means of the measures proposed in the Fantuzzi report. However, as with all support policies, two points need to be taken into account here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must ensure that no new bureaucratic bodies are created. There is already a proliferation of forums and committees. I am therefore critical of the proposal to arrange our own trade visits. It begs the question of whether associations already in existence might not be able to perform this task.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financial burden and the risk must not be borne predominantly by the public sector. Only if the operators also bear a considerable proportion of the costs will sensible projects be implemented without public money being wasted. That is why the amendment stating that the Community should pay 60 % of the costs in each case rather than a maximum of 50 % is not acceptable. Overall, I believe that the measures will unlock new sales potential for our farmers. I therefore support the Commission proposal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hardstaff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to start by saying that 15 minutes ago there were still no amendments in English to two of the reports despite your assurances at 9 o'clock that there would be some within a couple of minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the price package. I am afraid I cannot support the rapporteur's amendments calling for price increases across the board. Yes, many farmers are struggling at the moment, but large, richer farmers, though profits are down, are very far from the breadline. The extra expenditure is not justified overall and these amendments go against the whole thrust of the CAP reforms agreed in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">More appropriate would be temporary special measures to assist particular sectors to survive through short‐term difficulties. Mr Fantuzzi's report on the marketing of EU produce to third countries, mirroring similar schemes within the EU, is one such instance which could assist.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to welcome the proposals on fruit and vegetables, in particular the move to allow up to 20 % of produce to be sold directly to consumers at the farm gate or through farmers' markets. In the UK in particular, the large supermarket chains are gaining ever greater control of producers, insisting from a semi‐monopoly position that their suppliers conform exactly to their requirements. There has been a reaction against this. We have seen the growth of farmers' markets and the demand from consumers for less standardised fruit and vegetables in terms of size, seeking rather flavour and freshness at prices which provide a good deal for both producer and consumer. I therefore particularly welcome this proposal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since agricultural policy was converted into a price support system in the agricultural reform of 1992 to 1994, agricultural debates have in fact lost much of their charm. That is why I should like to focus on the future. Mr Jové Peres"s excellent report also talks about controlled and integrated cultivation. I have a very clear request to make to the Commission here: this method of agricultural production is a very good one and deserves to be supported because it takes account of the environment and heeds consumers" wishes. However, its impact and the form it takes vary across the Member States. Integrated cultivation is not the same thing in each Member State, and that is why we need uniform directives on the integrated and controlled cultivation of fruit and vegetables to be transposed in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should now like to turn to the rural development programme – the second pillar of the new agricultural policy – and say the following: the remarkable feature of this programme is the variety of measures for farmers and rural areas. Nevertheless, I do have a question for the Commissioner. The risk here is cofinancing. How can we guarantee that it will be possible to bring these programmes – which are really good for rural areas – to the people, when governments are refusing to proceed with cofinancing? Early retirement for farmers, the setting‐up premium for young farmers and modernising agricultural holdings to reduce production costs, for example, are extremely important measures, and I should like to welcome the fact that they are presented here in a separate rural development pillar. But there is still the risk that if cofinancing is not guaranteed by the Member States, then how are the people who live in areas of this kind going to benefit from these programmes, which are undoubtedly valuable, but which cannot be implemented if they are not taken up by the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final question for you: in Germany, can the <span class="italic">Bundesländer</span> also act as treaty partners, so that the programmes can at least be implemented in those <span class="italic">Länder</span> which are prepared to provide cofinancing?</p>
