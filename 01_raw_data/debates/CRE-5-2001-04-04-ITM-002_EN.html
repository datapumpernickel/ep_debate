The meeting comprised two parts; firstly, a follow-up to the Lisbon Process and secondly, discussions on the Union’s foreign relations. There was also a brief discussion of agricultural policy. I will begin by commenting on the Lisbon Process.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit in Lisbon provided a powerful direction for the Union in creating a competitive, world-leading, dynamic economy with social cohesion. At the summit in Stockholm, we added four different areas to the Lisbon Process. The first concerns demographic development in Europe which will have a major impact on the social agenda which must be formulated for Europe. This demographic challenge will gradually bring with it anxiety regarding national finances and a lack of labour. Rising to this challenge is a joint necessity for all fifteen Member States. Much work will be required, particularly in the social sphere. This can also be linked to the social agenda which the French Presidency so successfully launched in Nice. The demographic issues will therefore be added to the Lisbon Process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: biotechnology. In Lisbon the emphasis was on information technology. We do not wish to drop this – it will continue to be important – but we must also add biotechnology if we are to be an area and a part of the world at the forefront of economic development. This question must therefore also become a priority issue for the Union. We must not flinch at the difficult moral and ethical issues linked to this technology. Our discussions must address these too.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point we are adding is that we wish to see a link between social development, financial development and ecological development. That is to say, we cannot have sustainable social cohesion or lasting financial growth if these are not also based upon ecologically balanced social development.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point we are adding is for the candidate countries to also take part in the Lisbon Process in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">These four elements are thus being added but the Lisbon Process is, of course, just a process, a development. It is therefore important for us to realise that we will not achieve everything in terms of the social agenda and economic liberalisation all at once. This will have to take place gradually. The guidelines have been set and have once more been confirmed by the European Council in Stockholm. Our focus is full employment and active welfare states.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to economic liberalisation we took a further step forward in Stockholm. It did not extend as far as the Swedish Presidency would have wished but definite steps were taken in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue is the creation of an internal European market for financial services. The first Ecofin meeting in Stockholm was a major breakthrough in the area of financial services and risk capital, which was then confirmed in conjunction with the meeting of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed to proceed further on the directive on postal services. We also agreed that we will abolish the monopoly and open the gas and electricity markets to competition. It is true that we did not achieve the timetable we had hoped for, but this will take place and we emphasise our desire to go down this route. The European Council saw intense debate on the following: <span class="italic">If </span>certain Member States open up their gas and electricity markets to competition, will this, in the long term, result in an impossible situation should other Member States refrain from doing so. Should this be the case, we will gradually end up in a situation in which certain companies in monopoly markets are creating profits which will then be used in marketing offensives in other countries which have opened up their markets. This will build in tension in the Union which will be difficult to deal with. It is therefore important that we proceed with the deregulation of the gas and electricity markets as we have proposed in principle, but it must also proceed according to schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of European airspace will once more be addressed in Gothenburg in June. We have made progress in this discussion and in this field, too, I am hopeful that we will have reached an agreement on <span class="italic">the single European sky </span>before the Swedish Presidency is over.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of finance we will also achieve implementation of the directive on the internal market in national legislation such that 98.5 percent of the directive will be adopted before 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also start a new WTO round. We have emphasised the importance of making all the work linked to <span class="italic">e</span>Europe more secure. We also said in Stockholm that we will proceed with the Galileo project. This is important. There are still certain things which need to be clarified, for example concerning finance, but we consider this a socially beneficial project which must be carried out and as quickly as possible. Our transport ministers will be discussing the issue further tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We also decided that the distorting state aids in the internal market must be reduced by 2003 at the latest. A <span class="italic">scoreboard </span>is to be set up for this and made available for all.</p>
<p class="contents">This is primarily what was addressed in the discussions on economic issues in Stockholm. As I said earlier, it is a step in the right direction but not as far as we would like to get. This is a process and the direction in which the process is going is incontrovertible. It is that aspect of the Lisbon Process that concerns the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of the process is the social agenda. The Europe which is developing is not a Europe which can only be built by deregulating markets. Instead, there must also be an expression of political will to distribute the growing welfare available in Europe in a fair manner so that our citizens can live a rich life. Achieving a balance between economic liberalisation and social responsibility in the conclusions of the meeting in Stockholm has been an aim on the part of the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the social aspect, a new goal for employment has been set: it is primarily important that we concentrate on those aged over 55 in the European labour force. By the year 2010, 50 percent of this group must be employed, compared with the present 38 percent. We have a new intermediate target for the general employment rate in 2005, namely 67 percent overall and 57 percent for women.</p>
<p class="contents">By 2052 we are to have sufficient childcare in Europe to contribute to a social agenda which will enable young men and women to combine responsibility for a professional career with responsibility for the family and children.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of equal opportunities we seek to create not only a social Europe but also a modern Europe. Discriminatory pay differences are to be combated. Indicators for this will therefore be produced to make these differences visible. The Equal Opportunities Directive will be adopted and made more stringent this year, which is also a result of the Stockholm Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to create quality in work, whereby people are able to remain longer in their jobs without being forced into early retirement, workplaces need to be developed so that people who are not in complete health or not completely capable can also find a place in the world of work. Moving from a situation of European mass unemployment to a trend which involves a lack of labour, and the question of whether it will be possible to achieve continued economic growth demand that we exploit all the experiences mature, older people have to offer. The quality of workplaces must also be developed. The following issues are important to consider: lifelong learning, equal opportunities between men and women, the way in which we treat all those who have come to Europe in recent years, possibly as refugees, i.e. combating segregation and discrimination in the workplace as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gothenburg we will also return to an initial evaluation of European pension systems. Is this something which places a burden on normal wage earners, white collar and blue collar workers, is it just a question of whether one has a secure income on retirement? How can we address European pension systems in a situation where we are seeing fewer and fewer people of working age and more and more pensioners? Within the framework of open coordination this too should be something which we discuss together. We will return to this in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The social agenda has thus been developed and in this way these two aspects form a whole: on the one hand, economic liberalisation and modernisation, on the other, social responsibility and solidarity. These come together in a policy which will make Europe the most competitive, dynamic and socially cohesive region in the world. This is our vision.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what was addressed concerning the Lisbon Process at the summit. Alongside the Lisbon Process we discussed foreign relations. This primarily concerned four issues. Firstly, our relations with Russia. President Putin was invited to take part and met the group of 15 Heads of State or Government in face to face discussions. While President Putin was meeting us, foreign minister Ivanov met the foreign ministers. Naturally, we reiterated our concern over the developments in Chechnya and other phenomena in Russian society which we find unacceptable. Our main discussion, however, concerned financial development in Russia and opportunities for economic cooperation between Russia and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Some concrete results were achieved: firstly we are opening up opportunities for an EIB loan to Russia. While this is naturally limited, it is a breakthrough in terms of environmental initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will give Russia all possible support in its preparations for WTO membership. Membership of the WTO will open up the Russian market to fair competition as well as create opportunities for resolving long-standing trade conflicts between EU Member States and Russia. We will give Russia every support in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we said that we will actively participate in the upcoming anniversary celebrations in St Petersburg in 2003. St Petersburg is a stunning European city which is once more regaining its former beauty and certainly also its position in European cooperation. This is a clear signal from the European Union that this is also our concern. This was addressed during the discussion with President Putin. I would like to emphasise that discussion primarily focused on financial issues but naturally we repeated our concern over developments in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also visited by President Trajkovski of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM. He was invited more as a gesture of solidarity. When we, the Heads of State or Government, were meeting, it was natural for us, given the crisis developing in Macedonia at that time, to meet him and express our solidarity, but also to emphasise the importance of the various population groups in FYROM being treated in such a way that they all feel they have a place in society and a right to participate and be present. We also emphasised the importance of avoiding violence, while the foreign ministers were able to present concrete proposals regarding aid. This is part of a Balkan strategy. This April we will have the Stabilisation Agreement with FYROM ready for signing. This will be followed by a similar agreement with Croatia. This shows that the Union is playing a role in the Balkans and that a future is now beginning to dawn also for people living in the Balkans. The President’s visit was an expression of our commitment in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also appointed by my colleagues to travel to the Korean peninsula. The background to this is that we wish to express support for the process of reconciliation and détente now under way there. After all, this is the last major conflict remaining from the Cold War and the aftermath of the Second World War causing incredible suffering for those involved and major risks also from a military perspective. If there is anything we can do to speed up the process and support it, this must naturally be our common goal. In this area, too, the Union was able to join forces around shared principles and common involvement in appointing me on behalf of the Union together with Javier Solana and Chris Patten to travel there at some point during the next six months and confer directly with political leaders in both the North and the South about the process, about human rights, about détente and disarmament.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth foreign policy question which was discussed was the situation in the Middle East, which is ever present in the minds of all politically involved Europeans. The Middle East is our neighbour. We have an <span class="italic">enormous </span>responsibility for ensuring that the peace process gets back on its feet. In that sense peace and security cannot be separated. War, conflict and destruction in the Middle East are matters which also affect us. All of us in the Union, whatever country we live in, have a deep personal involvement in this part of the world. The Union’s Member States have excellent bilateral relations with the region and often with both sides of the conflict. On the other hand, the Union has not so far played any major role in taking the initiative towards finding solutions to the conflict or for various types of measure for dealing with the suffering which people in the Middle East are experiencing in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p class="contents">In Stockholm we asked Javier Solana to report back by the Gothenburg Summit, if not earlier, on how the Union can increase and improve its work in this area, and how the Union can contribute to restarting the peace process – naturally ideally together with the US, but always on the basis of the fact that it is the parties in the conflict which have to make an appeal, a request for participation. It is not inconceivable that such an appeal will come. When it does the Union must also be prepared to take on its responsibility. So these were the four questions on the international agenda – a way of practically, but without a great deal of fuss, expressing a common foreign policy for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, naturally we also discussed the situation facing European agriculture. We expressed solidarity with those affected, we expressed faith in the veterinary authorities and the ability of our agriculture ministers to handle the situation, we emphasised the importance of safe food and we said that the European budget in this context is already fixed or locked. In Stockholm, as Heads of State or Government, we were not in a position to debate the question of agricultural policy. We believe that our agriculture ministers have already done so. Preparations are also under way ahead of 2003 for a review of European agricultural policy. In light of this there was no reason for us to hold a major debate but we wish to express solidarity with those affected and, naturally, also show that we are aware that we have agriculture ministers, veterinary authorities and the Commission, who are doing excellent work in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also addressed the situation in the climate negotiations. It is unacceptable for any party to pull out of the Kyoto negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto negotiations are the instrument we have for addressing the change in fundamental living conditions that the climate represents. When we see primarily the US sending this signal, as far as we are concerned it is not possible to accept it. Together with the President of the Commission I have written to the US President and expressed our concern. At the moment, the Swedish Environment Minister is in the US together with the Commissioner for the Environment before continuing on to Iran, Japan and China for discussions there. We therefore will be well placed to emphasise the declaration which the European Council adopted in Stockholm as an annex to its conclusions repeating our commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. It is thus this process which we must keep to.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, that is what was discussed at the Stockholm Summit, a meeting which, in some ways, once more became everyday life for the Union. We addressed issues concerning people in their day-to-day lives. We have had an intensive period with a great deal of internal responsibilities. The French Presidency successfully resolved questions on the future decision making and responsibilities of the Union. Now we are highlighting that perspective again and focusing on things which concern people directly in their day-to-day lives. We did not achieve success in every area but there is no doubt as to the direction in which the Union is moving. That is the way things are when politics are at their best: we compromise, take gradual steps forwards and achieve results. This has also been the ambition of the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am confident that the Spanish Presidency, which will be addressing this follow-up work next spring, will make further strides. In this way we will create the Union we have dreamed of, a union which is dynamic, successful and which holds together socially. We recognise that we will not survive without taking into account ecological conditions. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, when I last addressed this House, it was to present to you the first Commission "Spring Report" to the European Council. As you will remember, our report takes stock of Europe's progress in implementing the Economic and Social Agenda agreed upon at Lisbon. The Stockholm Summit was the first summit specifically dedicated to assessing our progress and to setting the priorities for the next 12 months. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, for his firm, calm, enthusiastic chairmanship and organisation of our work at Stockholm. I also greatly appreciated the opportunity he gave us to meet President Putin and to discuss with him the European Union's partnership with Russia. This was a very encouraging meeting and confirmed Russia's strategic role. Indeed, President Putin assured us that Russia and the European Union share common values.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in turn, made it clear that we want to help Russia to fully integrate into our community of values; we want to identify the most appropriate means of cooperation, not only on the economy, the environment and energy, but on defence, security and the safeguarding of democratic rights as well. In this connection, while we welcomed the announcement of another reform programme yesterday, we cannot hide our concern at the way, at the same time, the government is gradually taking control of the television system. As Prime Minister Persson said, the discussions focused primarily on economic reforms in Russia, but the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia received close attention as well. As expected, the European Council assured President Trajkovski of its full support for the territorial integrity of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but, at the same time, the Union called upon President Trajkovski to take the grievances of the Albanian minority in his country into consideration. In any case, it would be a mistake to allow the current crisis in the FYROM to deflect us from our objective of helping the country integrate more closely with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we are about to pursue that objective further by signing the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I would like to emphasise that the European Union's credibility depends largely on our ability not just to set political and strategic objectives but also to take swift, effective action on the ground. At the same time, we must strive to bring about long-term stability in the Balkan region, and this means using all the tools available to us to integrate, little by little, the entire region into the European Union. Milosevic's departure from the scene is an important step forwards in this direction, bringing years of war and hatred to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to the debate on the Economic and Social Agenda taking place in the European Council. I agree with Prime Minister Persson when he says that the mood prevailing among the Heads of State or Government at Stockholm was one of rational optimism. A year ago, at Lisbon, we were still suffering from a sort of inferiority complex before the strength of the US economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now things have changed and we can see that Europe is in a position of strength in three respects. Firstly, the modernisation of our economy is now underway, secondly, we have a Social Agenda aimed at rejigging the European Social Model while preserving its character, and thirdly, we are making every endeavour to achieve sustainable development which will include the environmental dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The position recently adopted by the United States on the environment is worrying. Our concern is reflected in a joint letter from Prime Minister Persson and myself to President Bush. In any event, Europe must continue to act consistently and must take the lead on this highly important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A month ago, before this House, I stressed the problems of the distribution of labour and social exclusion. It is therefore necessary to step up our efforts to modernise the European Social Model within the framework of the Agenda adopted at Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I must stress once again the need to adopt clearer strategies to tackle the issue of our ageing society. It is with precisely this in mind that the Commission announced its undertaking to issue a Communication on the quality and sustainability of pensions in the light of demographic change. On the basis of these premises, the Commission urged the European Council to commit the Member States to taking action at the very least in six key sectors in which fresh impetus is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we still need to improve skills and training in information technology. Last Wednesday, the Commission adopted the <span class="italic">e</span>Learning Action Plan, which lays down specific measures on teacher training and partnerships between educational establishments, companies and industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Galileo programme. At Stockholm, I outlined the state of play to the European Council, including the fresh undertaking by the private sector to provide immediate funding of EUR 200 million. This means that the Member States no longer have any reason to hesitate. In fact, a clear unanimous political commitment has been made by the Heads of State or Government to implementing this project rapidly. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate that beating about the bush is no longer acceptable: a project of such strategic importance for all European citizens for the next 20 years can no longer be held up by squabbles over minor details. Decisions made by Prime Ministers should be implemented by the departmental ministers, who must oversee the practical implementation of projects.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the financial markets. For some time, the Commission has been arguing for an integrated Europe-wide financial market. We need a regulatory system which makes it possible for us to keep pace with this rapidly changing market. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has emphasised the importance of this sector and its enormous potential for both job creation and reducing costs.</p>
<p class="contents">As recommended, a European Securities Committee will be set up, chaired by the Commission. This body will act as a regulatory committee and assist the Commission in decisions regarding the measures to be adopted to implement practically the legislative acts agreed upon between the Council and Parliament in codecision. Thus, together, we will be able to push forward to create an integrated securities market, one of the major pieces missing from our internal market. The Commission will therefore be tabling major proposals in this field before the summer and I call upon this House to act on them without delay. I believe the debate on this should be pursued within the codecision procedure by qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Community patent. Progress in this field has run up against a number of national concerns ranging from language issues to loss of revenue for the Member States' national patent offices. I have to say that these positions taken up by the Member States seem to run counter to the interests of their own economic operators, who are constantly calling for us to produce a simple, clear, competitively priced Community patent. I sincerely hope that this situation can be resolved. Parliament and the Council must take swift, tangible steps to convert the commitments made in Lisbon into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the single European sky. As we all know, a whole series of major proposals is currently blocked until Spain and the United Kingdom come to a bilateral agreement on Gibraltar. For its part, the Commission will do all it can to help resolve this problem quickly. Moreover, the two Member States have agreed to resume discussions on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, postal services. Postal services are to be deregulated by the end of 2001, and the liberalisation of the energy markets will continue on the basis of the extremely clear, precise proposals we have already tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the demographic challenge, the European Council recognised the importance of ensuring the long-term sustainability of public finances, social services, health care and pensions. In any case, sustainability issues will have to be tackled within the framework of a more general European strategy for sustainable development, which will be one of the main focuses of the Gothenburg Summit in June. Moreover, in future, the Commission will incorporate sustainable development into its annual spring report.</p>
<p class="contents">As of next year's spring summit – and this is a very important point – in fact, the Commission will prepare just one report for each Spring Council, making the preparatory work clearer and more transparent. In this way, we will, at last, be able to concentrate on political factors rather than technical details. It will also make it easier for the public to understand what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Stockholm has provided us with a very good basis for action over the next 12 months. I have said this before and I shall say it again: effective action by the European Union is the only way to win public support for the European project. The surest way to lose that support is to increase the number of unfulfilled promises. We have got to close the gap between rhetoric and reality in Europe. It is all very well and very necessary to agree on targets, to set up task forces and to develop indicators and strategic visions, but what matters is action: action to create jobs and disseminate new skills, action to recruit and train teachers, action in national parliaments to cut red tape, action by governments and industry to invest in people.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens want a Europe that delivers the goods, and the Commission will continue to do so zealously and with total commitment. However, it is up to all of us, to all the institutions and especially this House, to the Member States and the social partners, to ensure that, in the wake of Stockholm, our words are translated into action.</p>

If you attend plenary after the Gothenburg Summit, as we naturally hope you will, you will have been here three times. That is a good sign. I hope that future presidencies will follow your example. But do not rejoice too quickly; we still have a few words of criticism. But first let me stress once again how delighted we are that you are here. We also understand that your presence here – albeit after three months – is the first time you personally will have been involved in the sort of dialogue with the groups of the European Parliament that your foreign minister and Mr Danielsson have already engaged in.</p>
<p class="contents">But, hopefully, today marks the start for you. You still have plenty of opportunity in the remaining three months to implement what Sweden stands for, namely transparency. We are, in fact, in the process of negotiating access to documents. Please do something, take charge in the Council so that we achieve a Parliamentary-friendly result, by which I mean a result in the Council which satisfies Parliament. Please do something in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm Summit – like the Lisbon Summit – used very ambitious language, language which I find somewhat over the top. A little more modesty would do us good. We hear talk of the Union as the most competitive and dynamic science-based economic area in the world. When you choose such ambitious words, then you must expect to be judged by your actions. You yourself said crucially that you regret the fact that the postal services and energy markets have not been liberalised and that no date has been set for any such liberalisation. I say to you quite frankly that this was only because a certain Member State, namely France, did not want a date and the Federal Republic of Germany followed suit. It is a partnership of negation and blockade! That is not how we see the Franco-German partnership. It should not be used to block things, it should be used to move Europe forward and that is what I call on the governments of France and Germany to do.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the European Council, you are not perceived as someone who is particularly fond of the Community method. On the contrary, you prefer intergovernmental collaboration. But this is precisely what happens when we rely solely on intergovernmental collaboration rather than the Community method! We get blockades. And it is the small countries which suffer in the end, because the large countries take Europe over, not forward.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are absolutely delighted that progress has been made on the question of the investment market and financial services. We are grateful for your commitment, but we also say quite openly – and this is directed at both the Council and the Commission – that we expect the legislative rights of the European Parliament to be safeguarded and for it to be suitably involved in future legislative decisions. We shall insist on this and these remarks are addressed to both institutions, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A word of criticism on the question of foreign policy problems, Mr President of the European Council. Yesterday, the widow of Andrey Sakharov, Yelena Bonner, visited our Group. Just as she arrived, news came in that the last free television station in Russia had been nationalised. That is totally unacceptable as far as we are concerned. The freedom of the press and media is one of the principles of democracy, in both the European Union and Russia. What the President of Russia, Mr Putin – whom I am glad you invited – said in front of the television cameras about Chechnya, was an insult both to the people of Chechnya and the dignity of the human race. We would have welcomed an immediate contradiction from you in front of the media!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We take developments in Russia very seriously because, like you, we believe that stability in 21st century Europe depends on having a strong European Union which can act, on the one hand, and a stable – hopefully democratic – Russia, on the other. Russia is not symbolised solely by the pretty town of St. Petersburg, I agree with you there. The Russia of the future will also be symbolised by respect for democracy, freedom of the press and human rights and we must make that perfectly clear to the Russian leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address a further point, namely developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I am delighted that the High Representative, Javier Solana, Commissioner Patten and the foreign minister of Sweden, Anna Lindh, as President-in-Office, are making this a focal point of their work and that – despite all the institutional complications which this entails – they are clearly all working well together. But that is not the point right now. The acid test, namely whether or not we help to bring about peace and stability, will be in the former Yugoslavia. If we fail there, we might as well give up any claim to involvement in world politics! We must set out our priorities in Europe, especially in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my final point. The American President, George W. Bush, will be with you in Gothenburg. Our Group is a close friend and partner of the United States of America and always has been. And that being so, we feel bound to tell our American allies that we cannot accept America’s refusal to abide by the Kyoto protocol. We criticise this as emphatically as we know how. We agree when America demands burden sharing in security and defence policy and for Europe to do more. But burden sharing also applies to environmental protection. We cannot leave a few countries to shoulder the responsibility while others shrug it off. Burden sharing also applies to environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to encourage you to speak out loud and clear: we stand for Europe and our values. If you are again successful – in Gothenburg hopefully even more so than in Stockholm – then we shall all benefit from the success. I wish this success on both you and us.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the President-in-Office for coming to Parliament for the second time and giving such a clear and concise presentation. We have seen how good he is with the ball, because the Europe of sport is also a Europe that we have to build together. I congratulate him on this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise that there is a new element in our relationship, which is that you have the opportunity to put the relations between Parliament and the Council on a new footing. We are still at the level of the Single Act; we have the codecision procedure and we have the common foreign and security policy and we hope to be able to reach an agreement with you for there to be a balanced relationship in the legislative field between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your report, we see it as a positive step that we are still on the Lisbon road; it is a long road, which you make as you go along, as the poet Antonio Machado said. For us it is absolutely crucial that there should be a balance between job creation, competitiveness and social cohesion. You have added a very timely element: that we Europeans need to reflect on our ageing population, develop an immigration policy, and think about pensions. I believe this is the framework within which we have to work together, and I should especially like to thank the Swedish Presidency for always placing such importance on social cohesion, because I think this expresses a fundamental value for Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few pending issues: with regard to sustainable development you can count on our full support; on the liberalisation of the capital market, which we believe is necessary, you have supported the Lamfalussy report and have proposed a route which does not include Parliament having the chance of democratically controlling the standards being developed. Despite that, I believe we are on the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the liberalisation of services and electricity and gas, the Socialist Group thinks that apart from its inherent worth it brings up a key issue: the power relations in society and the economy. We must take the citizens into account and the obligation to provide services of general interest. We do not want to see public monopolies being replaced by private monopolies. We criticise the United States a lot because President Bush has unilaterally denounced the Kyoto Protocol, but we never ask ourselves why he has done so. If you look at how the American electoral campaign was financed you will understand why the President of the United States has given in to the interests of the big oil companies: because he received massive donations from them. This problem faces us too, now that we are debating the status of the political parties. It is what is called ‘soft money’ and ‘hard money’. Funding must have limits, and a basic principle of democracy is that there should not be any accumulation of power. For us it is essential that there should not be unlimited economic powers.</p>
<p class="contents">As for our external relations, we are very concerned, not only because the United States has unilaterally denounced the Kyoto Protocol, but also because we notice a growing unilateral outlook in the United States in relation to issues that affect the international community. This is happening in the Middle East and the Balkans, and I believe it is important that, in this fundamental transatlantic relationship that we Europeans have, we should indicate to our partner that we do not share this view of the shape of international relations. We should do so at the start of the American Presidency in order to achieve a balanced, positive relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, allow me to speak of the future of Europe. The Swedish Presidency has the responsibility of organising a democratic and transparent debate on the future of Europe in the best Swedish tradition. You have launched the virtual debate on the web page; we did so a week earlier, but we are on the same lines as you. Yet a debate is something more than just a web page. A serious, open debate has to be held with civil society, with the social and political forces, but we also have to know how we want to decide and organise the future of Europe. There is a proposal here that both the Commission and Parliament agree upon, which is to organise a debate in three stages, using a working method inspired by the convention, to culminate in a short, decisive conference. The Swedish Presidency should consider, support and improve this proposal at the Gothenburg European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have high expectations in connection with the key issues identified by Sweden, and we hope that Sweden will also make transparency a key issue. On that point, we can all learn from Sweden. We must have access to more documents, and it is completely unacceptable that we should sit here in Parliament without knowing what our own ministers are saying and doing in the Council when they legislate. That is something which must be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted to see the Swedish foreign minister, who of course comes from a neutral non-aligned country, travelling around with her new travelling companions, the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr Patten and NATO’s former Secretary-General, Mr Solana, and we are delighted when, today, we hear the Swedish Prime Minister speak in favour of a common foreign policy. We hope that he too will discover the value of using the European institutions, that is to say the Community method, rather than the intergovernmental method he has so far been a little too fond of.</p>
<p class="contents">In Macedonia, we sincerely hope for success in ensuring greater equality for the Albanians. That is the only way to peace. If only we could also learn to take action before extremists begin to use violence. In that way, it would be the moderates and not the men of violence who obtain the credit for the results.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, which is also a Swedish priority, we should like to see still greater commitment on the part of Sweden. That is more important than anything else for securing peace, freedom and prosperity in Europe. It is also high time to prepare for the crucial reform of agricultural policy. We in the Liberal Group hope that you will listen to our colleague, Mr Olsson, who has proposed holding a round-table conference with the new countries on the subject of future agricultural policy. It is high time we put our minds to the problem. We wish you every success, Mr Persson, and, regarding the Lisbon process, my fellow Liberal MEP will take the floor later and comment on what you have said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said that, it is very rare, in Parliament, for the plenary session to have in front of it, as it has now, a joint resolution signed by the European Socialists, the ecologists and the European United Left as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The significance of this resolution is a clear political signal to both the Council and the Commission. It is based, Messrs Persson and Prodi, on the established fact that although the European economy is undoubtedly competitive, at the moment it is neither sustainable, nor does it have sufficient solidarity. This is not a statement before the event: a number of indicators are already set to red, whether in the field of sustainable development, in transport, in energy – not to mention the common agricultural policy – or in employment, where most of the new jobs being created are vulnerable, and where not enough of the added value is accounted for by wages. You only have to read the latest report from the European Environment Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to change direction on development, so as to make it more sustainable and give it more solidarity. This is the real challenge of the twenty-first century, and it is on this subject that I should like, briefly, to make a few proposals. Mr Bolkestein, what are we doing about company tax and the Primarolo group? There must be limits, Mr Persson, to increasing competitiveness: we must not forget our public service obligations. Mr Solbes Mira, substantial public investment is necessary to meet the Lisbon objectives, particularly on education and training, but also, for example, on transport and the rational use of energy. Mrs Diamantopoulou, if the social dialogue founders on the issue of temporary work, it is the Commission’s responsibility to propose legislation that will allow people to live their lives with dignity on what they earn. I heard a woman – a worker at a Danone factory – call for solidarity by saying ‘people should boycott Danone’s products’. I think it would be more reasonable for the European Union to adopt legislation imposing social and ecological obligations on companies. Our future depends on it too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my part, I shall stick to just one subject, which should, in principle, have been central to the work of the summit: the subject of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The ink was not even dry on the final declaration by the Fifteen, in which you reiterated, and I quote, ‘the goal of full employment’, and in which you welcomed the initiatives taken by businesses to promote corporate social responsibility, when suddenly, like a bombshell, came the announcements that 1 780 jobs were being axed by Danone and that Marks &amp; Spencer were closing all their stores outside the United Kingdom. These are just the latest examples, so far, of shareholder value, in other words, shareholder law, and just like Michelin, Ericsson, Nokia, Telefonica and so many others, they illustrate everything that is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are you going to do about these company directors who so brazenly thumb their noses at your declared intentions? The Commission, you write, in the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit, and I quote, will ‘present in June 2001 a Green Paper on corporate social responsibility’ and will ‘encourage a wide exchange of ideas with a view to promoting further initiatives in this area’. All well and good, but will you now, in the light of these new facts, be defining precisely what the Commission’s mandate will be? And will we, Parliament, be waiting, arms at the ready?</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that we should decide to create, perhaps within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, a new permanent body – let us call it a ‘subcommittee’, since that is the sort of language we use – which will be responsible for monitoring the strategies of major companies in Europe, a subcommittee open to contributions from trades union organisations, works committees, consumers’ associations and elected representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We could thus help to create, at our level, an effective monitoring device, which would be able to put some meat on the bones of the intermediate employment objectives that the Stockholm European Council has just set itself. We already know who the first employees will be: those of the French agri-food group that I have just mentioned, whose shareholders have just seen a 17% rise in the net profit from their shares, and those of the British chain whose shares have just gone to blazes on the London stock exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">If we ourselves take action to demolish the divine right of the big companies to sack people as they see fit, we shall, after all, be doing nothing more than defending, by our actions, a European project that is worthy of the name, and a Parliament that is closer to the people.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, the Stockholm Summit was hardly the greatest diplomatic achievement with regard to the development of the European Union; however, the business conducted at the Stockholm Council did certainly reflect the reality of what is happening in the European Union at this time. European Union leaders demonstrated solidarity in the face of the problem of foot-and-mouth disease, which threatens the European agricultural sector at this time. European leaders acted as a force for peace in the Balkans by offering timely support for the Macedonian Government and there was a full political and economic dialogue with the Russian President, Mr Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">Some progress was certainly made towards achieving the targets set at Lisbon last year to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by the year 2010. The Member States of the European Union are fully committed to the goal of full employment and we also see the achievement of this objective as an important way of meeting the challenge of an ageing population in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union employment rate targets, which have to be reached by the year 2010, mean that steady progress has to be made over this period if these objectives are to be met. Increasing employment rates will demand the active implementation of employment policies as foreseen under the European employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to build a two-tier Europe Union, a European Union of the haves and a European Union of the have-nots. We want to ensure that all the citizens of the Union are given opportunities to integrate fully into the workplace and to this extent we must ensure the intensification of training and education programmes for those without skills as well as putting in place retraining opportunities for the existing workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, much progress has been made in the last 12 months with regard to educating and training the European workforce in the benefits which lie open for us all from the use of the Internet and related e-commerce opportunities. The European Council did address the demographic challenge of an ageing population of which people of working age constitute an even smaller part. The issue of how best the Union is going to deal with future public and private pension programmes is a serious matter, which must be addressed by all EU Member States as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement was not reached on how best to liberalise the gas and electricity sectors in Europe. However, the structures do exist for addressing these outstanding issues on the basis of cooperation between the Member States of the Union. On this latter point, any further liberalisation of postal service operations in Europe must be fair and must be balanced and postal services play an important social and economic function in rural towns and villages within the Union. I certainly will not support a structure whereby postal services are liberalised in Europe and this only results in the quality of the postal service operations being diminished within the territories of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly will not support a situation whereby postal service operations will be cherry-picked by private operators, servicing only key lucrative urban areas which will benefit from such reform programmes at the expense of the rural parts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, certainly an achievement of the Council at Stockholm was the agreement to fast-track the development of a common approach for the regulation of financial services within the Union. The implementation of this plan has been subject to delays, which have prevented Europe, in the past, from taking full advantage of the benefits of the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lamfalussy report transfers legislative power from elected representatives in open assemblies to officials behind the closed doors of committee rooms. Sweden has identified transparency as a key issue and has a culture of transparency from which we can all learn. In the negotiations concerning transparency, however, Sweden has now accepted a new internal set of regulations producing more secrecy instead of more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 March, the Council also decided that future relaxations in the rules of confidentiality must be adopted by qualified majority voting and not, as is the case at present, by a simple majority. Thus, it will never be possible for the rules to be relaxed as long as Spain, France and Germany do not want them to be. It is those three countries which are the villains in the negotiations concerning transparency. This is something of which the public in our countries should be aware. How can a German, Green foreign minister accept responsibility for secrecy? The Council’s new rules on confidentiality are clearly unlawful. The Council cannot itself alter the Treaty’s regulations from simple to qualified majority voting. The new rules directly interfere with the section in the Treaty of Amsterdam promising new rules on transparency. Nor has the Swedish Presidency submitted the rules to the European Parliament. We must call upon our fellow MEPs from Spain, France and Germany to strike a blow for transparency now. Those three countries have placed the Swedish Presidency in such a humiliating position that it is having to betray its own key concerns regarding transparency and deliver secrecy instead.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have an EU in which neither the ombudsman, the Court of Auditors nor the Committee on Budgetary Control can obtain all documents for perusal. To that extent, we need the commendable Swedish rules on the right of access to documents and the freedom to provide information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the President of the Commission is crying over spilt milk. He is lamenting something which is the result of a policy that he himself helped to develop. This European Union policy on Russia is a policy of tolerance, a policy of prostituting our values<span class="bold">,</span> Mr President. What is happening now to the mass media has already happened in Central Asia in those ex-Soviet countries in which President Putin is re-establishing a postcolonial policy, a region which the European Union does not see the strategic importance of, just as it does not recognise the strategic importance of the Caucasus region.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Group Chairman, Mr Poettering, who voiced the concerns of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. However, I would urge Mr Poettering to talk to Mr Oostlander, who is the author of a report which, in the main, follows the line taken by the policy proposed by the Commission, a policy entirely focused on the fact that the Union's first priority must be to guarantee supply of Russian gas and oil, with the development and consolidation of the Rule of Law in Russia relegated to second place.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, in this very Chamber, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Posselt and I asked Commissioner Nielson for the umpteenth time to produce a policy on Chechnya which is, at the very least, a humanitarian policy, Mr President. For months, or rather for a year and a half now, we have been urging Commissioner Nielson to go to Chechnya. Just to go to Chechnya, nothing more. For his part, Commissioner Nielson has told us repeatedly that the situation there is such as to make a visit impossible. Yesterday, in view of the Commissioner's concern, I asked him to go to Georgia and Azerbaijan to open hospitals at least in these areas, which are not directly under Russian influence, as requested by the Chechen Minister for Health, Mr Umarkambiev, so that, at least, the Chechen people could receive health care instead of having to pay millions of dollars for treatment in a Baku hospital. Commissioner Nielson made no response. Mr President of the Commission, I have run out of patience, and I call upon you formally to remove Commissioner Nielson's mandate for humanitarian aid. Commissioner Nielson is a bureaucrat, Mr President: his travel availability is already booked up for the next four or five years. He pays a quick visit here and there to make sure that the Commission's development cooperation policy is running smoothly, but he has no real time for genuine humanitarian issues. I am not asking you to kick him out of the Commission, just to take this portfolio away from him and appoint someone else who will pay genuine attention to these issues and who will, at last, do something about the question of Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">What is currently happening in Chechnya is an outrage. There is absolutely no difference between events there and what took place in Bosnia, in Kosovo, incidents at which, after years and years, Parliament and the European Union eventually protested. We must make political investments, Mr President-in-Office. Our humiliating treatment of the members of President Mashkadov's government must stop. It is unthinkable that a minister of the Mashkadov government should have to apply for a visa and do so month after month. It is unthinkable that the European Union should not be able to grant a permanent residence authorisation to those whom you will have to visit in the future and persuade to sit round a negotiating table with the Russians. These are our consultative partners of tomorrow, and all we can do is humiliate them. And all this while the US government welcomes – as it did last week – the Chechen Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Akhmadov. Territorial integrity is not a theory: it is a practical concept in which integrity means that the entire territory is guaranteed, not that anything goes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Council should be clear on one thing: jobs can only be created if economic reforms are implemented consistently. What was begun in Lisbon and announced in Nice was not continued in Stockholm. In Stockholm, the brakes were applied. In this sense, the lack of agreement on Community patents is disappointing. The absence of a European patent is a powerful brake on the European economy, as has been confirmed in numerous talks with American researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want a Europe which promotes private commitment, risk taking and entrepreneurship, then these long overdue liberalisation measures must be taken.

In the Swedish media the Prime Minister has summed up the meeting in Stockholm as an ideal example of a successful European summit. Considering the meagre results, one might wonder what an unsuccessful summit looks like.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of us who read the newspapers and the conclusions, it is uncertain whether anything happened other than President Putin visiting the summit as a guest. The 15-page conclusion document mainly describes decisions intended to be taken at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that it was decided to start competing on which country has the most children in childcare and that the Commission will complete a project which is already underway. No concrete date was set for deregulation of the electricity and gas markets in the Union. The Swedish Presidency has completely given up on the question of liberalisation of postal services and, as we know, nothing came of the Community Patent idea. Football was played for longer than the question which most concerns Europe today was discussed, namely the agriculture crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Council should evaluate and consider what role these summits should have. Are they to play an important institutional role to resolve and pass decisions on important questions which have achieved little progress at other councils, or should they be developed into gimmicks with ever weaker and more toned down conclusions?</p>
<p class="contents">It is worrying that the Lisbon Process, which got off to a good start a year ago, is now being watered down. The upcoming Spanish Presidency has an important task ahead in ensuring that Lisbon comes to mean something concrete and is not just words on paper. The situation is precisely as the Council’s acting president admits: Work is not progressing sufficiently fast to maintain the rate of change.</p>
<p class="contents">If you listen to Mr Barón Crespo, you understand that the social democrats in Europe are not having such an easy time of it at the moment. The European economy flagging is no reason to stop the reform. Instead one has to put in more effort to be able to achieve competitiveness and increased wellbeing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions for the Council’s acting president. One point in the conclusions addresses the upcoming WTO negotiations, and I concur with that stated. I would therefore like to repeat the question which was dismissed last time as being far too national, and which concerns the Tobin tax. Has the presidency any view on the Tobin tax or shall we interpret the Swedish ministers’ publicly consorting with the Attac movement as indicating their position on an international tax on currency transactions?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns enlargement. It has been said that the enlargement negotiations are progressing and are one of the most urgent priorities of the presidency. Will you succeed with your goals? What is actually meant by a ‘political breakthrough’ in the negotiations?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the presidency at the summit in Gothenburg be able to state the EU’s point of view on the sensitive and difficult areas remaining so that the negotiations and a conclusion to them will become possible for the most successful candidate countries during 2001? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because one thing is clear: the spring summit will become standard practice in the future, so that we not only bank on a future-orientated, knowledge-based society, but can also actually live in it. We need the ambitious strategy of change decided in Lisbon. We need to make it tighter and more dynamic and Stockholm has added another brick to this edifice. And rightly so, given the jitters in the world economy, the shadow being cast over growth in the European economy and the crashes on the stock exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">The successes of the year 2000, with record growth, healthy finances, the lowest inflation and interest rates and 2.5 million new jobs, should not be underestimated. They say something about the need to continue the process of open coordination and link economic, employment and social policies. We must hold on to this, otherwise there will be no further progress. We must also anchor this in specific basic aspects of economic policy for the year 2001. We must be able to go on reaping benefits here, even if Europe has to overcome other weaknesses, such as excessively low, interrupted growth, unacceptable unemployment and the exclusion of too many people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European summit is rightly interested in economic reform, properly functioning markets and regulation, where having qualitative yardsticks is in people’s interests. We must therefore welcome the fact that the summit was not just a liberalisation and deregulation summit but that, at the same time, it is banking on pan-European regulation, where such regulation is needed in the interest of universal services, fair distribution and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the promotion of entrepreneurial initiative, with special attention to small and medium-sized enterprises and the venture capital and start-up finance which is vital to them, is in its infancy. And the EU summit rightly took account of the importance of research, innovation and new technologies in creating jobs and prosperity. In this context, we must clearly recognise that the analysis and use of public funding and the quality of such funding – including state aid – must be assessed more closely for its impact on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to invest still more in people and better quality jobs. And a further change of tack from a passive to an active employment policy, over and above the previous objectives of the European employment strategy, is still on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, the presidency is promising more democracy and transparency in economic policy. But where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets? The European Parliament wants speed and flexibility in the legislative area – just as you do – and welcomes the Lamfalussy report. But we insist on full transparency and proper symmetry between the institutions in the codecision procedure. We here in the European Parliament want the rights which the Council already enjoys. Help us to secure them. You too, Mr President of the Commission, can help to make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one more thing: we also want more democracy and a real partnership when the economic policy guidelines are decided. Both the Commission and the Council really can help in this regard and I call on them to do so.</p>

In this respect our Group is critical, as it sees that the results are poor.</p>
<p class="contents">In Lisbon what was agreed upon was a process of economic liberalisation, a process of structural reforms, the consolidation of the single European market and a move towards a single market for services, with the ambition of making the European economy the most competitive internationally by 2010, without, of course, giving up the social dimension or the levels of well-being that characterise the societies belonging to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At this European Council, however, we have found that the individual interests of Member States have blocked necessary processes of liberalisation. Others, through internal disputes, as the Swedish Prime Minister has said in his capacity as President of the Council, have not been able to reach the necessary agreement for the single European sky, and so it has not been possible to turn what were good proposals at Lisbon into a reality. That is why our assessment is critical and we think the results are poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the view taken by many fellow MEPs. I would add that the Europe of the Member States is not sufficiently European. There is also the Europe of the regions which remains hidden away. For example, you mentioned a shortage in the workforce, but there are regions in Europe which have unemployment of 6% or even of 16% and 20%. This is where Europe, and also the Member States, fail to come up to scratch. Additionally, we need a bigger Europe in order to translate the Union’s weight into political clout for the benefit of stability and peace. We have already mentioned Macedonia. It is necessary for everyone to be aware that the existence of second-class citizens always leads to difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by making an observation with regard to the Middle East, where an escalating conflict is claiming victims in Palestine on a daily basis. We too have worked hard for peace but, every day, we watch it being increasingly shot to tatters. We are, in fact, a major donor to the Palestinians and have granted Israel privileged relations. But we are lacking in commitment to the right to self-determination on the part of the Palestinians. We do not exert enough pressure to obtain peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The social issues, particularly the question of unemployment, were hardly touched upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Göran Persson, it was the intention that the meeting was to focus on employment and employment policy. However, there are two different forms of employment policy. The first is about increasing provision on the labour market by increasing the labour force, i.e. increasing the employment rate. The second is about reducing the number of unemployed. These are two different areas of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Stockholm you devoted yourselves to expanding the labour force by adding new groups to the labour market. This was to be achieved by reducing the number of women at home in Europe and by retaining the elderly on the labour market for a few more years. I have nothing against measures to increase the available workforce but no one can claim that they provide any direct benefit for the unemployed. In fact it is rather the reverse, such that the 14 – 15 million people who are unemployed face increasing competition for jobs by the addition of new groups at the same time as wage-related pressures increase.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been possible to combine both these areas of employment policy, within which the aim is both to increase overall employment and combat unemployment, by also proposing a reduction in normal working hours to 35 hours a week, or six hours a day. It has been claimed that a cut in working hours would not result in new jobs but this does not apply to low-paid jobs where there is a very clear link between reduced working hours and more jobs. Cutting working hours would also benefit all those who are already in work and make it easier for them to combine work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see actual measures for the unemployed. It is not yet too late as the Swedish Presidency still has a few months left to run. I would like to see measures specifically focused on those who are unemployed and which help them here and now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Prodi has rightly stressed that the glass is half full and half empty, that some results have been achieved, but not all. He is right. However, I would like him to summon all the determination and courage which he has displayed on other occasions and make it clear that the single currency is going to come into force next year and that, if certain large-scale reforms which should have been dealt with at Stockholm are not completed before then, we will be in danger of having a currency but no control over the economy, with the consequences which are already apparent in Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues of energy, liberalisation of energy and the European patent are fundamental. President Prodi, in my view, you would be performing a great service for Europe if, with great courage and determination, you were to declare openly – which I am sure you will do – that these are essential reforms that must be carried out without delay in the interests of all the European countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is how we can best describe the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Macedonia this coming Monday in Luxembourg. This is evident from the continuing efforts by both parties to prevent an ethnic division of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to see Europe’s wish in that light, namely the wish for the leaders of all parties represented in the Macedonian Parliament – including Slavonic and Albanian Macedonians, therefore – to grace that ceremony with their presence. The symbolism is crystal clear. In that way, Macedonia’s entire political forum would demonstrate that it is choosing to walk a peaceful, European course.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this symbolism, employed by Europe, misleading and, therefore, dangerous? The European Council’s lucid explanation in Stockholm seems to contradict this negative interpretation. This applies equally to the busy shuttle diplomacy on the part of Mr Solana and Mr Patten vis-à-vis Macedonia and Kosovo. The role of NATO in this European policy on crisis management is unmistakable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this encouraging note is not in accordance with the press information I received yesterday. According to that notification, Commissioner Patten has asked for six extra KFOR infantries to reinforce the border control between Kosovo and Macedonia, a request which is, in fact, entirely in line with the European Council’s declaration in Stockholm. According to that press report, however, only three countries have apparently responded to Mr Patten’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to make every effort to prevent a Yugoslavian scenario in Macedonia, European and American levers will really need to be deployed to the best possible effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet the Council’s conclusions give a rather odd double impression of unrestrained intervention on the one hand and abstention on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as multidirectional interventions are concerned, there is hardly any subject in the economic and social field which has not been mentioned, even when there was nothing new to say about it. This makes it hard to identify the main thrusts, and in particular it is no longer possible to distinguish between what is Europe’s responsibility and what is the Member States’ responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Stockholm Council was very concerned about the viability of social protection systems, a subject which the previous Council, in Nice, had expressly designated as being the responsibility of the Member States. One only has to mention, somewhere in a sentence, the need to respect subsidiarity, and the machine can rumble on its way as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="contents">This omnipresent method raises not only the question of subsidiarity, but also the question of how effective the work of the Council actually is. We very much doubt whether the Heads of State or Government were really able to examine all these subjects, and we very much doubt whether it is possible to make things happen by using such methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The large number of subjects dealt with merely serves to show up, even more sharply, the almost total absence of any role for the euro, despite the fact that the euro had been presented to us as the number one priority in order to achieve a competitive Europe, which was the principal objective of the Stockholm Summit. The Council’s conclusions contain, buried somewhere beneath a mass of words, an indication that, in less than 300 days, the euro should be circulating in the form of notes and coins, but there is no mention of the organisational reforms needed to extricate it from its present weak position in the exchange markets. There is also no mention of the Commission’s recent communication on this subject, which seems to have been put aside.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the euro does not recover, Mr President, its credibility in the eyes of the public will be called into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Referring to the economic situation, he said that a reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank would undoubtedly help the European economy, but it is at least as important for Europe to bring about more ambitious transformations. When, in the same connection, he says the IMF would probably lower its forecast for growth for the euro area for this year to 2.5%, we can see that the financial players have reacted to the totally indecisive outcome of the Stockholm Summit with as much disappointment as my own Group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, here in Parliament. We have thus already fallen below the 3% growth target that was set for the mid term as a basis for sustaining and improving employment and social security in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Stockholm was like a mini Nice, without the squabbles. Nobody wanted to speak up for the European common good, and most governments clung to their own interests, such as they imagined them to be. That is what happened, despite what was certainly an enormous effort to achieve results on the part of the country to hold the presidency. At the beginning of the year someone joked that the aims of Lisbon had become the promises of Nikita Khrushchev. It was he who said at the start of the 1960s that the Soviet Union would overtake the United States in ten years in terms of economic power. In the wake of the Stockholm meeting, there is going to be a grain of truth in that joke. We have to remember that the decisions that are now required concerning European patents, the liberalisation of competition among the gas and electricity boards and in the Post Office, making air traffic more flexible, Galileo, and other matters, will not result in any real changes until four to ten years have gone by after the political decision is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nonetheless like to mention one positive decision that was taken at Stockholm. At last a nugget of something concrete has been found for a policy on the northern dimension. Hopefully, it will encourage not just us in the European Union, but the Russians too, to seek and find suitable targets of cooperation in other areas. As a Finn, I would ask the Prime Minister of our beloved neighbour and the country to hold the presidency the following question. The conclusions of Stockholm state that the sound economic situation that has lasted quite a long time now in the European Union would not have been possible without monetary and economic union: has the Swedish government started preparations to fulfil their Community obligations by joining the third phase of monetary and economic union? <span class="italic">Och på svenska: Sverige är alltid välkommen i klubben. </span>[And in Swedish: Sweden is always welcome to join the club.] </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to say a few words on the foreign policy decisions taken in Stockholm. Last weekend, we all witnessed the television reports and the tension surrounding former President Milosevic’s arrest. Our Group, undoubtedly like many others here, welcomes this arrest with open arms. We also have a great deal of respect for the way in which the authorities of the former republic of Yugoslavia handled this matter. It must have been an extremely difficult situation to deal with. There was a great deal of tangible tension. The fact that this step was ultimately taken indicates that another move has been made towards more integration within our law-based community, also here in Europe. At the same time, our wish remains, of course, to ultimately see Mr Milosevic brought before the International War Tribunal in The Hague. We assume, as before, that the European Union will keep the pressure on in that respect and that the International War Tribunal will ultimately be the place where he will face his final reckoning.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have seen a great deal of tension, probably more than some of us had expected, in FYROM’s border regions. We have to say that, for all the problems in the past, we still have a great deal of respect for the way in which Mr Patten and Mr Solana dealt with the situation there, in tandem with the Swedish Presidency. Needless to say, the early warning systems are still not fully functioning. We probably could have reacted more promptly in a number of areas. The consultation structures are not yet completely in place either, but we certainly have more tools at our disposal than before. We are better able to operate in those regions, and we are seeing the first signs of a common foreign policy, something which we would very much like to promote further. Once again, the Association Agreement too could be an excellent tool in this respect. Here in Parliament, we are ready to adopt this agreement as quickly as possible, and we want to encourage everything which can make progress possible in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East, the Ministers Perez and Nabil Shaath of the Palestinian Authority are supposed to meet in Athens today. In actual fact, violence increases with each passing day, while we would like to return to the old agreements, which, at the very least, ensure that both parties keep their own troops in check, and retrace our steps in terms of violence. The UN resolutions, the Oslo agreements: it is as if some things no longer exist, and both parties operate in a very irresponsible manner. We hope that Moratinos, our representative, in conjunction with Mr Solana and the Swedish Presidency, succeed at least in bringing those parties around the negotiating table once more, for there is no other alternative. Either we talk and negotiate – which will bring the things which were discussed in Camp David, as well as the different possibilities, back on the negotiating table – or we end up in a situation where this spiral of violence, from which so many of the extreme factions on both sides stand to benefit, is given a chance to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my third point. We are pleased that the Swedish Presidency has managed to bring the northern dimensions as a whole back to the fore once again. St Petersburg has been mentioned. This is a crucial point for us. You have relations and contacts there which provide extra opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to my final point. The Swedish Presidency has, traditionally, always played a very clear role, not as the Swedish Presidency, but as Sweden in the UN Security Council. It is evident that during the Bush administration, the cowards of this world threaten to change their course again. It is important that Europe in this respect – Mr Barón Crespo has actually said this on behalf of our Group – adopt its own, self-assured role. Not so much an anti-stance: we should not fall back on old patterns. It is a ‘global village’, and we rely on global partnership. In that respect, a unilateral withdrawal from Kyoto cannot be accepted. This is also true of the unilateral withdrawal of the United States in other respects, such as in the field of rocket defence systems. As Europe, we must counter this with intelligent, partnership-focused policy, and I expect that the Swedish Presidency, together with our former fellow MEP, Mr Schori from the Security Council on behalf of the Swedish Presidency, can play an excellent role in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that many Swedes were delighted to see their country finally being able to act as host to the leaders of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Stockholm was supposed to be about the creation of a competitive Europe. It was supposed to be about action, not EU rhetoric, but was that the case? No, unfortunately not enough, as the President of the Council himself has admitted. Reform of the EU is going too slowly. It was unfortunate that those in Stockholm were unable to agree on a timetable for deregulation of the energy markets. On the other hand, they did succeed in agreeing to create a common financial market, which has been eagerly awaited.</p>
<p class="contents">We liberals now assume that the Council is prepared to act such that we achieve a solution which can also be accepted by Parliament. Mr President, this is about democratic support and openness. The Swedish Presidency has an overall vision of bringing the Union closer to its citizens. This is an excellent ambition. It therefore surprises me that at the Stockholm Summit the first step was <span class="italic">not </span>taken towards wide-ranging reform of agriculture and food policy, as this is the question possibly most under discussion over the breakfast tables in Europe, even – as I have understood – in the Prime Minister’s own home.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out we are now halfway through the Swedish Presidency. One issue is becoming ever clearer: – It is becoming more and more problematic for Sweden to remain outside the EMU. My question to the President of the Council is therefore this: according to the <span class="italic">Council</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>what difficulties will be posed in terms of a more cohesive Union by Britain, Denmark and Sweden remaining outside EMU in the long term?

<p class="contents">Will the development of our trade with Russia simply strip that country of its natural resources for the lowest possible price? How will this ensure its sustainable development in future?</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainability is not just a domestic issue. It is an international and inter-generational concept.

The two sides are not equal: on the one hand, there is a State, which has never defined its borders, which is expanding its settlements and has one of the strongest armies in the world; on the other, there is an occupied people and an occupied territory, without either State or army, which is unable even to exercise any control over bean imports, let alone borders: since 29 September, this people has been besieged, bombed, its villages sealed off, with its sick dying at military check points, its doctors and nurses attacked and its parliament unable to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no European Union diplomat who does not speak openly of the way the Israeli government has contravened international rules. Human rights organisations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International and Israeli organisations such as Betrelem also condemn this. We must do something to restore the possibility of peace and put an end to the cycle of violence. The Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to stop the terrorism perpetrated by Palestinian extremists but, on the other hand, the Sharon government in Israel is not sending out peace signals: murders outside the Occupied Territories, bombings, expansion of settlements, carte blanche for the settlers, who have bombed architectural structures in Hebron which are part of our human heritage. It is time for the European Union to find something which will convince the Israeli leaders: not sanctions or embargoes, given the disastrous results where that strategy has been adopted, but at least the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which would probably suffice, according to Israeli organisations like Rabbis for Peace and others. I feel that this is extremely important: we must speak out for peace, but peace in respect for all ...</p>

It is not clear, now the Stockholm Summit is over, how Europe intends to deal rationally and practically with the extremely serious issue of our ageing population and the resulting decline in the work force, while, at the same time, ensuring that it maintains a sufficient standard of living. The outrageous on-going lack of social service provision, the discriminatory treatment of pensioners, the poverty zones which are becoming increasingly common throughout Europe, require clear, courageous choices to be made. In other words, the single currency will not suffice without reform of the financial market. It is pointless to attempt to achieve a stable European Union without a genuine, effective foreign policy. As President Prodi rightly said, Europe's credibility is at stake: too many promises have been made and not kept after recent European summits; there have been too many dashed hopes. Either we do act resolutely right now, or Stockholm will go down in history as yet another pointless stage in the long, exhausting attempt to produce the promised Europe for the Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Should we not put them down to the fact that we were not really able to do our job there, that we failed to disarm the UCK, that the fragmentation of responsibilities between numerous international organisations and within the European Union itself is a fact of life and that the crisis has again taken hold because we failed in our duty?</p>
<p class="contents">I have a second question. Mr President-in-Office. I know it is not your sole responsibility as a result of this summit, but how, in your view, will future European Councils operate once the number of seats rises and there are 27 participants, if the European Council is to discuss every detail? The European Council was founded so that the Heads of State or Government could discuss fundamental questions. Now there are sometimes 30, 40 or 50 items on the agenda. Do you not think that the heads of government are trying – and more’s the pity – to assume responsibility for every detail, undermining the authority of their own work and the work of the European Council in the process?</p>
<p class="contents">The third point that I wish to address concerns the Council itself. I think that, if we want to implement a reform process, the Council of Ministers must become more transparent, more efficient and more open. Everything gets passed to the European Council because of the inefficiency and inability to take decisions of the weakest institution which we have in the European Union, namely the Council of Ministers. That is not your personal responsibility; it is a structural question which we urgently need to address. I think that, for this reason, now that we are heading for a Union of 27 members, the question of legislating in public needs to be raised. This applies to the Council, when it acts as legislator, and should demonstrate that we have an interaction in political debate in Europe. Responsibilities must be clearly outlined and we must make clear that we need decision-making mechanisms here which bring about results. We cannot offload everything on to the Heads of State or Government, on to you, only to find that we are unable to reach a solution.</p>

I would also like to congratulate him on a successful meeting in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">I will concentrate on the Lisbon Process. A discussion has taken place here concerning whether or not the process represents progress, and criticism has been heard from the right that insufficient progress has been made. However, this depends on how the meeting of the European Council is perceived. If the progress of the Europe of the future is measured only in terms of deregulation, it is clear that the meeting was possibly not a success. I myself, who am also in favour of deregulation, would have liked to have seen us progress further in that direction. However, the most important aspect of the Stockholm Summit was balance; in other words, the fact that the deregulation which nevertheless was achieved was balanced by a policy for employment, social security and justice. We can <span class="italic">never</span> create a Europe for its citizens if these ingredients are not also present.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Carlsson said that the Social Democrats in Europe were having a difficult time of it. Let me name these ‘difficulties’, which in actual fact centre on a social democracy that has produced fairly good economic growth and which is responsible for political development in practically every country within the EU. The difficulties are probably <span class="italic">rather </span>in another direction on the political spectrum, namely among Mrs Carlsson’s friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the Stockholm Summit as a success, especially in terms of the drafts provided by the Commission, because the balance is once more established. There are clear targets for employment, intermediate targets and employment targets for older people. Moreover, and I would address this particular point to Mr Schmid – there is certainly a link between reducing unemployment and increasing employment! I would like to state that employment targets are more important than unemployment targets, although both are important. In Sweden, we have combined unemployment targets and employment targets. This, together with an active labour market policy, means an increased supply of labour but also reduced unemployment. It is important that we have achieved this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that childcare be introduced as a social right taking different forms in different countries, partly in order to give men and women the chance to participate in the labour market. The issue concerns <span class="italic">quality </span>at work, not just creating <span class="italic">more </span>jobs but creating jobs where health and safety are good, where employees have substantial influence and where opportunities for skills development and professional development are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">All these ingredients were present at the Stockholm Summit. This was the first stage of a process which will go on for many years. It was also particularly important because this first stage means that the process will be able to continue in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to see a link with the Gothenburg Summit and the ecological dimension, which is the next step. Link this to the open coordination method and we will achieve a coherent policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider that this addition is only the decent minimum. What in fact does it mean politically? Might it possibly be nothing but words? Both the Council’s decision and the Commission’s basis for discussion for sustainable development, which were presented after the Stockholm Summit, place far too great an emphasis on economic policy and on competition-driven growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Ecofin’s structural indicators were adopted in full but not a single environmental indicator was included, not even the Commission’s proposal for indicators on energy efficiency nor any indicators on emissions of greenhouse gases. In this sense the Stockholm Summit was a disappointment. The US now threatening to withdraw from the Kyoto Agreement is scandalous and the EU’s leaders must consider serious measures to show…</p>

Needless to say, we want more, but sound results have been achieved. Despite this, I would like to underline a number of the warnings which Mr Prodi flagged. The summit is increasingly running the risk of degenerating into a media spectacle. We have had Mr Putin, the next time we will get President Bush and, as a result, the other topics will, of course, be pushed into the background.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the President of the Council the following. Yesterday, we received a visit from Mr Sakharov’s widow in the group. Mrs Sakharov made the following statement: ‘Look, in Russia, the situation at the moment is such that there are most certainly democratic institutions and there is freedom of press, but they are no longer functioning properly.’ I wanted to ask you if these kinds of concerns which are around in the European Union also came up in the meeting with Mr Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the following. We are all grateful for the fact that Milosevic is behind bars. Needless to say, this is not about whether or not the Bush diplomacy has scored a victory. This is about whether the European Union can help the former Yugoslavia, namely Serbia and Montenegro, in the fight against poverty, with the economic reforms which need to take place and with offering the people a future. Could the Council not take an initiative in this respect, also to demonstrate to the people that it is indeed worthwhile having Milosevic behind bars?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the summit in Gothenburg will not be overshadowed by the presence of President Bush, but will instead focus on enlargement. This is supposedly the last summit of the year on enlargement. Let us remove the obstacles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Stockholm has highlighted at least three subjects on which I should like to comment this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding progress and the conditions for economic growth in Europe, I think that important signals have been given. This morning I have heard some people criticising the halt that has been called on certain forms of liberalisation. I believe that if we look at the situation with regard to Ericsson in Sweden and Marks &amp; Spencer or Danone in France, it is time to start asking questions about the cost of the growth that we are in the process of creating. Mr President of the Commission, I have listened to your appeal that Europe should keep its promises, but it cannot do this if it shows the door to thousands of workers. In that respect, Mr President of the Council, when you call for a balance between liberalisation and social responsibility, it seems to us that you are in agreement with the real concerns of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I believe, and this will be my second point, that any progress that can be made in restructuring our services of general interest is essential. There is this draft framework directive. We are waiting for it to progress further, because unless it does, what is the point of defining this draft framework when we have already liberalised every sector? We are already well behind schedule: it is time to act and to restructure these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is method. Many people have already said this before me: Lisbon marked a certain stage, and Stockholm makes it official. It seems to us essential that the conclusions that you adopted regarding better coordination between the Luxembourg process, the social agenda, the Lisbon process and the broad guidelines of economic policy should enable this spring Council to rediscover, or discover, its true role, that of defining policy on the basis of the preparatory work carried out by the Commission, which enables everybody to play their part, the Commission in its role as instigator, and the European Council in its role as policy maker. Because if everyone wants to do everything, though one sometimes has the impression that it is less painful, very often it is also less effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Then again, in using these methods, it seems to us that, if we want to take into consideration this social responsibility that you have talked about, Mr President, we shall also have to modify our indicators. We are not entirely clear about these social situations. Admittedly, we have made some progress since Luxembourg, but what do we really know about the way added value is distributed? What do we know about how employees are defined in terms of their mobility? What do we know about ways of opposing these job cuts, which were supposed to be merely economic job cuts, and which are becoming financial job cuts? This is certainly not the Europe that we want to have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is a man who has made an all-out commitment to interethnic coexistence. However, if you look closely at the situation in Macedonia, you cannot but conclude that the root cause of the extremist incidents lies not so much in Macedonia as in the hesitant action of the West in Kosovo. The fact of the matter is that the minority rules in Macedonia for the Walachians, Serbs, Romas and Turks are exemplary and many countries in the region would do well to follow its example.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the Albanian minority of around 28% naturally needs special treatment. They have 4 ministers in key positions in this government. What the previous government unfortunately failed to take into account was the question of higher education for these people and the need to resolve the problem of Tetovo University. This government made a start on all this, despite the Kosovo crisis, and just as it did so, along came extremists from outside and upset everything. I call on the Council to help this government to continue on its chosen path and to call on the opposition in Macedonia to support it. And I call on the Member States to send money to Tetovo University so that it can start the academic year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Kosovo is concerned, I urgently call for the borders with Serbia and Macedonia to be closed to extremists. We can probably do this with the help called for. But UNMIC must get elections under way in Kosovo at long last, so that elected Albanian politicians can take their fate in their own hands and put the extremists in their place.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments in the west must realise that problems need to be monitored closely and a solution found. If we keep stopping half way, we just give the extremists room to manoeuvre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that those who are keen to emphasise the fact that Stockholm was only a half-hearted attempt at a summit, with a great deal of rhetoric and little in the way of results, would very much like to make us overlook the fact that, in Stockholm, a number of vital steps were taken in order to bring the European policy we have pursued back on track, both socially and ecologically. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you made reference to the Spanish Presidency in your introduction a moment ago. I would, in turn, like to refer to the Belgian Presidency, for Stockholm has given this Belgian Presidency a number of very essential and firm mandates. First and foremost, it was given the mandate to formulate goals with a view to taking up the fight against poverty and social exclusion in concrete terms at European level. This is a very important mandate in my view. In fact, I hope – and this hope is shared by my Group – that the opportunity will arise to discuss once again a poverty standard and a proper income for all citizens of this Union as part of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, demographic development, to which you yourself have already referred. I am pleased that the European pensions debate is at long last no longer held among the Finance Ministers within the framework of healthy government finance, but also among the Social Affairs Ministers with a view to guaranteeing everyone a proper pension. Solidarity between the different generations, solidarity among the older generation and hence, the priority of guaranteeing the quality of pension schemes, will form an essential task and responsibility of the Belgian Presidency, admittedly after the homework in Gothenburg has been handed in. In this framework, my Group is, in fact, giving its unqualified support to the decision to start formulating concrete goals on employment for older employees. However, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, choices must be made in these areas too. It is quite clear to me: this choice is not about brazenly discontinuing early retirement schemes or increasing the pensionable age, but rather about choosing to introduce flexible end-of-career schemes and to improve the quality of work.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my final point, Mr President-in-Office: the quality of work. Here too, we expect a great deal from the Council and the Commission, which has to provide us with indicators so as to, thanks to this open coordination, secure us not just more, but also better jobs. Ladies and gentlemen, the quality of work, however, is not just a question of indicators and open coordination. It is also a question of legislation. We therefore expect an extra effort, both from the Commission and from the Council, to provide us with a revised directive on European works councils, within the framework of restructuring – which we are now experiencing once again – and to make a start on the directive on information and advice as a matter of urgency. These too will help guarantee the quality of work, and we are relying on the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies to do their bit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to thank you for the support you have expressed for the Swedish Presidency and the work which we are carrying out together with yourselves and, naturally, with the Commission, and which gave us a very good basis to work on ahead of the Stockholm Summit. This means that we were well-placed to achieve success. I will comment on the points you raised from two perspectives. I want to talk firstly about foreign relations and secondly about the Lisbon Process, as my initial report was primarily structured in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to foreign relations, I am happy that so many people here have recognised that there is an aim on the part of the presidency to get the Union’s Member States to really work together when they <span class="italic">are able to</span> act together. This is based on consensus, unanimity. We are aware that not all of us within the Union agree on every issue, but on this issue we <span class="italic">are</span> agreed. When we are able to put forward common principles, we must naturally also act together.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally we attracted a great deal of attention in the media when we received President Putin as a guest. I would not be surprised to see even greater attention from the media when we receive President Bush, but those who believe that in receiving these visitors we are seeking media attention are naturally mistaken about the fundamental work of the Union. We have an obligation, we have a right, to <span class="italic">take </span>the initiative in our relations both with the United States and Russia. Relations must be deepened and developed, and dialogue must be open. It must be honest and it must be critical, but we must naturally, on the basis of our size and our strength, carry out this dialogue with very, very great self-confidence. This is what this is about. I am pleased that you realise that, during the Swedish Presidency, we are seeking to highlight joint action in foreign affairs also within the European Union and within the framework of the Council. This is far from unimportant.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, a few words on the Lisbon Process. Let me comment on the discussion on deregulation and liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the Prime Minister of a country which has opened up many markets, which has liberalised and deregulated. I primarily see positive effects of this, but I would be a very poor politician if I did not also recognise the difficulties in carrying out such a process. This is a very large and fundamental reorganisation. It is <span class="italic">far </span>from<span class="italic"> </span>simple. I have very great respect for the colleagues who, in their<span class="italic"> </span>respective countries, are to begin this process in a number of central areas and deal with the political debate which many of us have already had in our countries. It is no easy debate. I believe that it would be an incredibly great mistake to force through decisions and so create a situation where these fundamental changes in many countries would <span class="italic">immediately</span> lead to extremely strong national opposition. Therefore, I believe that the method we are using in the Lisbon Process is superior for this type of fundamental change in financial and political conditions. I say this as a response to Mr Poettering of the Conservative Group, as I can see how the process will develop over time. The process is heading in the right direction, and we are implementing it in such a way that we have the support of national political opinion in each country. We can never ignore this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to state that I myself do not wish to see deregulation and liberalisation unless the advantages created and the increased growth achieved are used to give ordinary people the chance to live better and richer lives. We constantly have to maintain this balance. Here I am talking to those who said that we have not produced any initiatives to combat unemployment. Our work in this respect is characterised by the fact that unemployment is best combated by economic growth and economic development. Without increased production, we will have no opportunities to successfully combat unemployment. We can create various programmes, reduce working hours, carry out a large number of different initiatives – but for those people who are most hard pressed, this will always be a defensive programme. If we are to be proactive in addressing unemployment, we must do so by increasing the cake by developing the economy. This is why we have drawn up guidelines in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers have mentioned enlargement of the Union. We are currently negotiating intensively with the active participation of the Commission. As far as I can judge, the negotiations are successful, but they are not easy. My task as President-in-Office of the Council is to ensure that the Union’s regulations are highlighted in the negotiations and that we run the negotiations so as to achieve a change in legislation, markets and political systems in the countries now seeking to join the Union. This change must make their accession as painless and successful as possible. These negotiations are difficult and we are in the middle of them. I am hopeful that, in the negotiations in the spring during the Swedish Presidency, we shall achieve success that we will be able to describe as a breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding openness, the presidency and Parliament are in alliance. I hope that we succeed. I myself would agree with the criticism which Bertel Haarder makes of the situation. These are not reasonable conditions for political work, and we have to create greater openness if our citizens are also to have a greater chance of becoming directly involved in what forms the basis of the political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to discuss the prior conditions for Sweden, as a small country, being able to contribute to the issue of EMU and other issues: but I do not intend to take up your time over this. I will be happy to talk about this question again in a bilateral context. What is important for us now is to jointly ensure that the Union’s economy is in as good a condition as possible on the day, in almost a year’s time, when the single European currency is introduced. We all have an interest in this, whether we are participating in the currency union from the start or whether we will be joining later. Success, which is what we are seeking, is to the advantage of the entire European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, thank you once more for your many constructive contributions and points of view. I would also like to thank the Commission for working so well with us in the run-up to the Stockholm Summit. I look forward to meeting Parliament again following the Gothenburg Summit, where I hope we will be able to say that we have taken a step forward on enlargement, even though a great deal of work will remain to be done on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I shall be very brief in my reply because it differs only slightly from what Prime Minister Persson said.</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction to this summit of tempered optimism but awareness that difficult objectives have been achieved has been common to almost all of today's speeches, as has commitment to meeting the need for future progress and the even greater need to focus on action and implementation of decisions taken. Having said that, I do acknowledge the objections raised and comments made by many Members on the issue of decision-making processes, on the need for new decision-making processes. Mr Brok, Mr Poettering and Mr Segni made it clear, from the different areas of the House, that the decision-making processes observed during summits and in all our work must be strictly reformed in this lengthy review process which we have undertaken, due to be completed between the end of 2003 and early 2004. This is a clear commitment made by Parliament and all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Another general point, then, was covered by many speakers: on the one hand, the conviction that globalisation is absolutely essential, and not just a necessity but an extremely positive debate for Europe, but, on the other, the justified – genuine – fear of some of the effects of globalisation. I cannot, in this Chamber, fail to make my deep concern known to Parliament at the way the excellent economic progress and the rise in employment which have taken place in recent years in Europe have been accompanied by increased disparity in the distribution of wealth in what could ultimately be called a social injustice indicator, which does not necessarily have to be part of the globalisation package. Quite the contrary: it is possible to rectify the situation and combine globalisation and social justice. This is a subject which requires a great deal of thought for, all too often, we confuse the two things: we believe, that is, that globalisation, the fact that we are opening up our economies, will automatically lead to a less equitable, wider disparity in the distribution of wealth. This does not have to be the case at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, another point emerged as a common concern, linked to the forthcoming Gothenburg Summit, and that is the adoption of a unanimous position on the Kyoto Protocol. This is certainly not an attack on the United States, merely awareness that we must act responsibly. And, as Europeans, we must have a general sense of responsibility towards all the citizens of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with one last point, which might appear minor but which I consider to be extremely important. It concerns one of the most important issues dealt with at the Stockholm Summit, and that is the implications of the enlargement of financial market relations and the resulting relationship between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Mrs Randzio-Plath has raised this issue and rightly so, and I would like to respond briefly right here before Parliament, for it is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that the agreement reached in Stockholm refers to a Decision on comitology, reproducing the 1999 Decision word for word – what is known colloquially as the Aerosol case – including the statements it contains and the Commission's statement. In this case, the Commission did not declare in Stockholm that the entire securities sector should be considered to be a sensitive sector, as requested by certain States, but it did undertake to avoid going against predominant views which might emerge within the Council in the case – and only in the case – of particularly sensitive implementing measures. In other words, in particular, the Commission will assess each case individually, and I can therefore see no reason to change the current balance between the institutions in terms of delegated powers. Indeed, Parliament will be able to comment on the distinction between the essential elements and the technical provisions of the measures proposed by the Commission. Clearly, this distinction must be established through the usual procedure for codecision between Parliament and the Council. In addition, Parliament will, and must, be informed on a regular basis by the Commission of the Securities Committee's proceedings and, If the European Parliament resolves that the draft measures submitted by the Commission exceed the implementing powers provided for in the framework legislation, the Commission commits itself to expeditiously re-examine those draft measures, taking the utmost account of Parliament's position.</p>
<p class="contents">There it is: we have to decide on the basis of concrete legislative proposals within the framework of the codecision procedure. I wanted to point this out because it would be a shame for the progress of such an important matter as this, decided upon at Stockholm – the most important decision taken in Stockholm – to be hampered by our procedural problems or our difficulties in adopting a common position. This must not happen: we must proceed with all transparency, for the very reason that the European citizens expect the decisions taken by the highest assembly, that is the decisions taken by the Council, then to be rapidly implemented, or Europe's credibility will fall even more. This will be extremely important at the Gothenburg Council. I hope that the preparations for the forthcoming summit will be made with the same diligence and the same transparency which characterised the Stockholm preparations because, ultimately, Gothenburg is Act II of the Stockholm Council: that is, it will end the series of reforms decided upon in Lisbon, reforms whose long-term compatibility must be assessed, which is something we are no longer in the habit of doing. But if we do not learn to do this as well, all the decisions we take will have to be revised in the future.</p>

As so many speakers have said, on the economic front, Stockholm was a great disappointment. Once again Heads of Government could only agree to set theoretical deadlines for ministers to liberalise markets in the future, rather than actually set the seal on agreements that should already have been made or reach those agreements themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">To coin a phrase, the liberalising talk is 'all spin and no delivery'. We are witnessing serious under-performance by standards which Europe's socialist leaders have set themselves. It is all a far cry from the spirit of the single market when the centre right ran Europe. One of the major failures of the Stockholm Summit was in the foreign affairs field. With the great events taking place in the world, it was as if the Stockholm Summit was ignoring them. For example, the General Affairs Council on 19 March decided once again not to table a critical motion in the United Nations sub-committee in Geneva, dealing with human rights abuses in China. Until 1997, every year the European Union did so. Now the socialists are failing, it is business as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important – as Mr Poettering told the House earlier on, and other speakers have referred to this – last night the PPE-DE Group heard Yelena Bonner describe the situation in Russia today: Mr Putin came to Stockholm, Mr Persson gave him a cheque for EUR 100 million, the very next week Mr Putin begins yet another crack-down on the media. There is now no single independent media channel in Russia. This is a scandal. I am very disappointed indeed that Mr Persson did not take the opportunity this morning to criticise President Putin for the way in which he is repressing the media in Russia, the way in which democracy is being rolled back. This is our great neighbour to the east. We must deal with it on a practical and political basis, but with frankness and determination. God help us if the socialists had run Europe during the cold war.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish to concentrate on two issues which I know Parliament considers to be of the utmost importance, namely the Galileo project and the future of postal services. Having the opportunity to speak in this debate gives me the chance to welcome not only the Council's conclusions on the creation of a single European sky, but its determination to submit proposals on slot allocation at Community airports to Parliament by June.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Galileo it is worth remembering that this programme was actually instigated by the Council in March 1998. This commitment was emphasised by the Cologne Council and Feira when it was stated that strategic decisions had to be taken by December 2000. But then, to be blunt, the Council, no doubt under pressure from finance ministers, got cold feet. I accept that the cost of Galileo is around EUR 3 billion, which means the involvement of the private sector is essential, but the benefits to Europe in both economic and social terms will be immense. We have a commitment from the main European companies in this sector. What we need now is a political commitment from the Member States not only to push ahead with Galileo, but to push ahead in a positive and determined way, working alongside the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier in the day Mr Poettering criticised the Council for not giving a timetable for the liberalisation of postal services. I actually agree with the Council on this and would remind not only Mr Poettering, but also Commissioner Bolkestein, of the position Parliament took at its first reading on postal services a couple of months ago. By an overwhelming majority it voted for a controlled, gradual liberalisation down to 150 000 with no end-date for liberalisation. So when I read in the Stockholm conclusions that the Council wishes to work with Parliament, I welcome this. But I would remind the Council that Parliament's position is clear, unambiguous and has been arrived at with a clear political consensus across political divides.</p>
<p class="contents">On post Parliament does not have a problem. The Council does. This solution is clear: accept Parliament's position, abandon the extreme policies put forward by Commissioner Bolkestein and I am sure we can have an agreement on the future of postal services within days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The importance placed on the Social Agenda is certainly very positive, particularly regarding the social security and health care systems, the setting of employment rates, the willingness to cut public subsidies (although I would have liked us to have gone further), the development of new technologies, or the decision to create a European Food Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, as regards the liberalisation processes, Mr Prodi, serious asymmetries are being created within the European Union, and this urgently requires draft legislation to regulate intra-Community investments, as almost all the Parliamentary Groups reminded Mr Bolkestein yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by referring in this context to the intention of creating a single European sky that has been put forward by both the presidency of the Council and that of the Commission, and I should like to say to Mr Prodi that we trust that the Commission will act in this matter with the determination and prudence needed in view of the commitments undertaken, and in any case in accordance with the Community acquis. Part of the Community acquis too, Mr Prodi, is the Gibraltar clause, which does not date back to the eighteenth century but to a 1987 agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain, within which we must push forward in order to finalise this agreement in Gothenburg.</p>
