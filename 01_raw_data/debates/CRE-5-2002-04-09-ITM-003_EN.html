I want also to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her regular attendance at our meetings and for the help and expertise that her staff provided. I especially want to thank the staff of our own Committee on Budgetary Control who were most diligent and expert and generous with their time, despite being moved around a lot recently, which is not very helpful. Nevertheless, I could not be more full of praise for them. I also want to thank Mr Bourlanges, who laid out the strategy for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We started out with 65 paragraphs and ended up with 95. I am not going to try to summarise the report because it would take far too long. I am going to mention its principal features. The main feature of this report on the budget for the financial year 2000 was the surplus of EUR 11 billion (or 14%). That figure requires some explanation. Firstly, more than EUR 2 billion came from revenue. I do not think that any national government would apologise for having taken in too much revenue. Another factor is the reserve of EUR 800 million. Again, the reserve is there not to be spent if possible. It should not be included in the surplus. When other details are taken into consideration, we had a real surplus of around 9%. Of that 7.2% could be said to come from the Structural Funds. If the Structural Funds are taken out of the calculation, there was no problem with the rest of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Structural Funds, the regulations were completed in mid-1999. The new Commission came in at that time. It was never a possibility, considering the detail and the complications of this regulation, that our objectives for spending in the year 2000 could be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us to the point of the difficulty of these regulations. Most member governments did not submit their framework plans until the year 2000 itself. Some of them were not admissible at that time because of the difficulty of understanding the regulations. So, there was a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline the fact that a German official told me that in the six-year programme ending in 1999, there were 60 000 projects in Objective 1 areas of Germany alone. That gives us some idea of the extent of the problem of administering these funds, and there are about 500 staff members in the relevant Commission Directorate-General.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the Structural Funds has to be looked at in depth. All the institutions of the Union have to apply themselves to simplifying the regulations by which we implement European regional policy before the new programme comes in and before enlargement in four years' time.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point is the topical question of fraud and irregularity. It is the duty of the Committee on Budgetary Control to identify failure in administration and propose solutions. That is why the message from the Committee on Budgetary Control must always be critical and risk sounding rather negative. The final responsibility for failure always rests with the European Commission, but the national governments spend most of the money. When we talk about the failure of the Commission, we are talking about its failure to control the national governments and the regional authorities, which is not always an easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU at all levels is a partnership with the national governments. If the Commission can be blamed for anything it is for failing to do its own public relations work, to stand up for itself and to stand up to the national governments when they are in breach of the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the discharge procedure we expect to make a political decision on the performance of the Commission. We in the Committee on Budgetary Control do that on the basis of a report from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's annual financial statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control passed the discharge by a vote of something like 17 to 4. That is a resounding vote of confidence in the work that the Commission has done in the year 2000. However, we have not overlooked the weaknesses in the system and our motion for a resolution proposes changes and improvements both in planning and administration. We are looking for better cooperation between the Court of Auditors, Parliament and the Commission in the implementation of European policies and more efficient spending of European money.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to address is the failure of the Court of Auditors to give a statement of assurance. We should point out that it gave a statement of assurance in relation to revenue and administration. We have set out our solutions in paragraph 44. We would like to see figures for the rate of error. We would like to see figures which would enable us to compare one year with another. But we would like the statement of assurance of the Court of Auditors in relation to the revenue side of the budget and administration to be clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">The only information we have about the rate of fraud and error comes from the Commission's statement for the year 2000. It would appear that the rate of fraud and error is about EUR 2 billion, or about 2.5% of the entire budget. Of this, about 10% of traditional own resources seems to involve a serious problem. If that is taken out of the calculation, the rate of fraud and error, as best we can make it out, is about 1%. I tried to establish how other States deal with this problem and I find the only comparable systems are in the United States and the Netherlands. By the standards that they apply, I want to state categorically that the Commission would pass with first-class honours: our rate of fraud and error is below what is acceptable in those countries. So while we have readjustments to make and recommendations for improvements, at the same time we do not want to overemphasise the negative aspects of our report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to see us aim for a situation where the Court of Auditors would present us with a statement which could be read in reasonable time by members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament, by members of national parliaments and students of European politics. We have failed to do that so far. I hope that my successors will achieve something that can be understood by European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blak (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, I should like to recommend that we give the Commission discharge for the Development Fund, and I should like to ask Mrs Schreyer to communicate this to Mr Nielson, as I can see that he is not here today during this important debate. I threatened along the way to have the discharge decision postponed if the Commission could not supply any results. In fact, it has done so. There are still a few problems, but we shall have to look at those in a follow-up report. I have focused in particular upon quality in the form of the number of follow-ups of audit results this year. What concerns me is that the Commission has no overview of how many audits have been carried out, where and by whom. One of my first questions to the Commission was: ‘How many audits did you carry out in the year 2000?’. The first answer was twelve, and that – I think – was extremely few, considering that there are 70 ACP countries. The Commission then found a few more reports. The thought occurred to them that a number of reports had no doubt been produced out in the delegations, and Mr Nielson assured the committee that 73 audits had been carried out in 2000. I then asked for a list of these audits. It proved to be a list containing very sparse information, which did not leave me much the wiser. However, it provoked a lot of amusement – especially in the Court of Auditors – when it was seen what was being presented as audits. Moreover, almost half of them were from Malawi, and it turned out that these were to be deducted from the number of audits, leaving 52 and not, as Mr Nielson had promised us in the committee, 73. It may well be that 52 audits are enough, but it is worrying that the Commission does not have a better overview of how many audits are carried out and by whom. There are no central records, and there is no general view of the activities ‘out in the field’. The Commission has nonetheless convinced me that it is not necessary for the audits to be carried out from the headquarters in Brussels. I have therefore withdrawn my original demand for at least 50 audits. However, the more financial responsibility that is farmed out to the delegations, the greater the demands that are made in terms of oversight and coordination to be exercised by headquarters.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also asked the Commission to give me a better explanation of why the remaining millions of euros mentioned in the Court of Auditors’ annual report have still not been claimed back. It is two years since this was noted, and still nothing has happened. I asked DG AIDCO’s director-general if, on the basis of the auditing system and the information received from the delegations, he could issue a statement to the effect that the EDF funds are used in accordance with the principles of ‘sound management’. I have still not had an answer to this question. I could have put the question to Commissioner Nielson if he had been here today. However, it may of course be that Mrs Schreyer can help me. There has been a lot of criticism of the way in which the ACP’s secretariat has operated. Extremely critical audit reports have been prepared, and there have unfortunately also been some court cases in Belgium leading to convictions for not complying with legislation. That is not, I think, something that we can live with in the EU. New management is now in place, with which I have had some incredibly productive meetings. I hope that matters are improving, which is why I have said that we are now waiting to see what the outcome of the Court of Auditors’ decisions will be, whereupon we shall have to address the issue again.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make a couple of observations about Mr McCartin’s report on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. I think it is a splendid result, and I should like to commend him for having listened to my many amendments and for the fact that they have been incorporated. That is one of the ways in which we can persist in following up the previous discharge decisions, and that is something extremely important to do. There are, however, two important matters I have been left in ignorance of. When will the disciplinary proceedings taking place at the Stockholm office be concluded, including on the part of OLAF? And the same question applies to the IRELA case from Spain, which we have talked at such length about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a couple of words about the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned. Mr Virrankoski has carried out an outstanding piece of work that is both incisive and well balanced. In connection with the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned, it is not easy to understand our asking for transparency. Everyone here is on the ball, especially when it comes to their own money. I should like to say that I am deeply disappointed at the secretary-general of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who has written round to all the other groups, saying that it would be a disaster if there were to be transparency in connection with our accounts. We criticise the Commission for not being open but, when it comes to ourselves, we close our eyes. I really do think that the PPE-DE Group’s Secretary-General should be deeply ashamed of ringing round and asking for there to be total secrecy concerning taxpayers’ money. That is something we cannot live with.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that one of the things that strikes me is the desire to close down the Finance Inspectorate. When the figures for 2000 are examined, it can be seen that there were errors in seven per cent of the documents. I think this shows that it must be possible for the impending internal audit to be independent. However, I would still say, forget about closing down the Finance Inspectorate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the discharge decision where the Council is concerned, I should like to say that we stand by the committee’s observations and decision. I cannot countenance some members of a group being made to toe the line, with the result that we have to change the decision we voted in favour of in the Committee on Budgetary Control. All things considered, I am going to recommend, however, that we give discharge in all the areas. Things are going well, in fact much better, and that is something we can only be pleased about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seppänen (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Madam President, the work of the European Coal and Steel Community in recent years has been guided by the knowledge that it would cease functioning this summer. It has been decided that the work of the ECSC should be discontinued: half a century is enough.</p>
<p class="contents">In its final years of operation the ECSC functioned like a bank. It borrowed and lent money. The Commission was responsible for administering its finances, and it is now the Commission’s task to discontinue the bank’s work, call in its loans and pay off its debts. Its credit balance exceeds its debts. It would appear that there will be a surplus of approximately 1.1 billion euros after the ECSC has been wound up. In accordance with decisions taken earlier on, this surplus is to be invested profitably in the financial markets. Some of the assets are to be used to set up a separate Coal and Steel Fund, out of which money will be allocated for research in these areas, in accordance with the principles proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The yield from assets is intended to benefit the coal and steel sectors, which had to pay levies to the ECSC to fund its work. That is only reasonable. In this connection we have to remember that the money in the research fund was collected from the old Member States, and that it must first and foremost be used for research in these countries’ coal and steel sectors. However, if we consider how very important these sectors are in the economies of many of the applicant countries, it is only reasonable to call on the Commission to initiate talks with the old Member States in order that the new members might also share in the information obtained from research in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must invest the assets left over after the ECSC ceases to function to ensure it obtains the greatest possible return. If choices have to be made between safe investments and taking risks, then risks should be avoided. It is important to be able to predict what sort of return the Commission can expect on its investments. For the first time, in connection with this year’s accounts, we can have information on yield from the investment of the ECSC’s assets. In 2000 the average rate of yield was 4.72%. This sort of information is an important step in the right direction, but further steps have yet to be taken. With regard to subsequent years there is every good reason to state a benchmark target rate of return, on the basis of which the auditors can assess how successfully the target has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly it will be important in the years to come to assess whether the ECSC’s old activities are being wound down in the way that was planned. The Commission intends to keep on more than thirty officials to be specifically employed in the distribution of the ECSC’s estate. That would seem to be a large number. In the years to come Parliament must monitor the situation to ensure that the assets left over from the European Coal and Steel Community are not used to maintain needless bureaucracy on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has submitted a statement of assurance in which it recommends the granting of discharge. Parliament can endorse their opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Virrankoski (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Madam President, there was a very high level of implementation of the European Parliament’s budget for the financial year 2000. The utilisation rate was 99.28%, and the ratio of payment appropriations to all commitments was 91.05%. The high degree of implementation was partly the result of the end-of-year mopping-up transfers, where funds were transferred to pay for Parliament’s buildings. In this way we were able to reduce the future costs of renting. In the future this sort of practice should be done away with and we should budget strictly for actual estimated expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s accounts are abstruse, however. For that reason, the report proposes that the way they are presented should be clarified and that, more specifically, there should be a clear breakdown of capital investment with regard to buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">The main points of focus in the budget for 2000 were the promotion of activity based management and better allocation of human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Activity based budgeting and management has begun to improve, but, as the report states, the results are still modest. Power of decision and responsibility must be delegated further downwards, and each member of staff’s personal responsibilities must be clarified. We furthermore have to change to a form of administration in which it is the results of actions that are assessed and not so much the way the administration is organised. Only in this way can we make the administration more efficient and make savings.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the recommendations of the Rome-PE report should be implemented and internal financial control improved. We must be able to redeploy human resources more flexibly and put an end to functions that are unnecessary. The current system is too rigid and set in its ways.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also linked to the question of inequality between women and men. The European Parliament is still a very old-fashioned place to work in. In the last eighteen months eighteen people have been appointed to posts in categories A1 – A3. Of them, just one was a woman and seventeen were men. The report criticises this and calls for the introduction of quota arrangements until a normal state of affairs is reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Political groups are also connected with the matter of administration. It is in accordance with the principles of activity based management that the groups’ internal autonomy should be developed. For that reason the report requests that this special feature should be taken into account in one way or another when the Financial Regulation is amended. The report insists that the groups should present their balance sheets and financial statements more clearly and that they should be published. Furthermore, there must be improvements made to asset management and inventories. In addition, the responsibility of the group as party to agreements in general and as employer in particular must be legally clarified so that the European Parliament is not always ultimately accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Parliament’s two places of assembly we state that just the variable costs of meetings alone at Strasbourg are 33% more than in Brussels. In addition there are considerably higher costs mainly due to the fact that there is double the number of buildings in Strasbourg. Shortening the length of a part-session produces savings of just 1%. This matter would perhaps be worth looking into by the Convention dealing with Treaty reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest single problem is the cost of the Louise Weiss building in Strasbourg. No agreement has been reached concerning the final investment costs with the project’s promoter, SERS. The dispute concerns the completion date and that is to be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. In addition there are disputes over work, additional work and unnecessary work. There are also disputes between the promoter and the subcontractors. It may take as long as ten years to resolve the argument completely.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that Parliament did not want two meeting places, but agrees to meet in Strasbourg under great pressure from France in particular, we must insist that the dispute over the construction costs of the Parliament are resolved immediately. The city of Strasbourg and the Alsace Region have the controlling interest in SERS, owning 60% of the shares in all. They must therefore wield their power. Furthermore, France must take responsibility for seeing to it that the European Parliament does not need to be party to the disputes and can pay for its work premises immediately and acquire title accordingly. It is unfair that Parliament should continually have to remain vigilant to ensure that it is not being billed for costs that are unjustified.</p>
<p class="contents">With these observations the report proposes granting discharge to the Secretary-General in respect of the implementation of the 2000 budget and to the Accounting Officer in respect of the accounts for 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to concentrate on those institutions that you have just mentioned. The exercise, of course, considers the expenditure, and assesses the effective use of European taxpayers' money relating to those institutions. There is also reference in this report to the Council, which I will touch on later.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking there were no great concerns relating to the Court of Justice although we will clearly be following up some of the requests we have made to it on more detailed issues. We grant discharge to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors seems still reluctant to name Member States found wanting, and I warn the Court again that we will not rest until this request is complied with. More consumer-friendly reports would be welcome, as would a declaration of interests by the Court on the Internet, as is currently carried out by most of the other institutions. The Court must never feel itself to be too grand to conform to the standards we have learned to expect from other high-profile public servants. We grant discharge to the Court of Auditors, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Ombudsman budget is very small, so any money not spent will perhaps be disproportionally reflected in percentage figures, but it is something that the Budget Committee needs to keep an eye on when they are setting the Ombudsman's budget. We grant discharge to the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee of the Regions is also a relative newcomer to the European scene. It is good to see some shared expenditure with the Economic and Social Committee although at times this does not go far enough. A future report by the Committee on Budgetary Control may perhaps examine the value for money and impact assessment of this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions performed quite well in relation to the Belliard and Montoyer buildings and played quite a good game with the poor set of cards that were dealt to them unfairly by Parliament. We grant discharge to the Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the area where the report's focus lies, and that is on the Economic and Social Committee: a committee which has been in existence since the beginning of this great project. Whilst the report recognises the Economic and Social Committee can act as a forum for interest groups which would otherwise not be able to make their voices heard in the EU context, developments over recent years – including, for example, the social protocol – must now be considered. Do we see some duplication here for example? We have concerns that the information does not filter down to the grass roots.</p>
<p class="contents">The massive costs of financing this institution, which will reach almost EUR 100 million after enlargement, also gives us great concerns. Even amongst some trade unions, which are recognised by and which use the Institution, there is criticism. One prominent British trade union was prepared to say 'that the Economic and Social Committee appears to be redundant; we would be content for it to be abolished'. Another worrying aspect of the ESC came in their reaction to this report which claimed that the concept of value for money of a body established by the European Treaties is highly questionable and politically unjustifiable. Try telling that to the taxpayers of Europe! I think it is pretty obvious, when you see reactions like that, there is not much accountability going on within the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that discharge be refused to the Economic and Social Committee for the years 1996 and 1997. This is a historic move and it is not taken lightly. Only on two occasions before has the discharge been refused; once of course which led to the forced resignation of the Commission in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">It may perhaps seem strange that we have waited until now to assess the accounts and expenditure for 1996. However, it has taken until now to receive objective clarification on irregularities relating to payments of members' travel allowances. The whole sequence of events from the fraud itself involving 59 members of the Economic and Social Committee amounting to over EUR 1 million, to the scandalously relaxed attitude of Economic and Social Committee managers and their efforts to cover up the problem, to the botched and unprofessional approach of OLAF, the European Fraud Office, all reeks of incompetence, procrastination and amateurism.</p>
<p class="contents">It has taken six years to get to the bottom of this fraud that occurred in 1996. This situation is a disgrace. It has meant that there has been no chance of prosecuting those involved, as the Courts have said that too much time has elapsed. There have been improvements since then however, which is why we do grant discharge to the Economic and Social Committee for 1998, 1999 and 2000. It is important that the Convention on the Future of Europe should take heed of the message in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn finally very briefly to the Council. Traditionally we have lumped this together with the Commission expenditure. This year, however, the Court of Auditors has prepared a critical report on the workings of the common foreign and security policy. This again is a fairly new area for the Council. The Committee on Budgetary Control has asked for answers and clarification on some of the issues on which the Court of Auditors has concerns. The Council is discussing that this morning, so we are waiting for the results from the Council before we take a vote on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will bear that in mind when it comes to the vote. I hope that the Economic and Social Committee will deal with the fact that we have not given them discharge with the gravity that this issue deserves.</p>

In my view, cooperation has been excellent this year. I should also like to thank the two draftsmen of opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy, for their very pleasant and smooth cooperation. Finally, of course, I should also like to extend a word of thanks to the representatives of the decentralised bodies to whom we can grant discharge today.</p>
<p class="contents">This discharge does in fact concern three bodies: the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) in Thessaloniki and the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo, based in Thessalonica and Pristina. The Court of Auditors has closely examined the financial accounts of these three bodies, and in all three cases it has reached the conclusion that the annual accounts for the financial year 2000 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular.</p>
<p class="contents">As your rapporteur, I have been looking into what we said in the discharge report for 1999. In the first two cases, we recommended that an external evaluation be implemented and an Action Plan be submitted. As far as the Foundation in Dublin is concerned, we enquired last year whether it would not be preferable to work more closely with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. We asked CEDEFOP for verification of how cooperation with the European Training Foundation in Turin could be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I have to inform you that the Foundation in Dublin has faced some delays in implementing this request. The external evaluation has just been completed, the Action Plan has only recently been discussed, but the request has now been complied with, it has been presented for discussion and I, as rapporteur, will naturally remain in contact with the representatives of the Foundation in Dublin to ensure that the discharge report for 1999 is carefully observed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as CEDEFOP is concerned, this exercise has been fully completed and I have good news on this front. It is nice to have some good news on a discharge for a change. CEDEFOP has indeed fully complied with our request and a cooperation agreement has now also been concluded with the Foundation in Turin. In my view, it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by our institution, the European Parliament, that considerable progress has also been made on behalf of the European taxpayer in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also have positive news about the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo. We must remind ourselves of what the situation was like. The challenge in Kosovo after the war was enormous. Not only due to the trail of material damage and human suffering left by the war in Kosovo, but mainly due to the damage which the Milosevic regime caused in Kosovo for more than a decade, which was typified by a chronic under-investment in resources and permanent violations of human rights. And I should like to emphatically praise our people in the field, the people of the European Agency for Reconstruction, but also the people of the Kosovo task force who went out there immediately after the war. The work they did there, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, was incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors and everyone who reads the annual reports and the three-monthly reports can see for themselves how incredibly efficient our management has been over there. We have learnt from our mistakes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, and this too is a positive message. I was your rapporteur for a special Court of Auditors report about the actions taken by the EU in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We made mistakes there, we learnt from these, and this is how we managed to take effective action in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about the situation in Kosovo. The energy sector is the most important area in which we are investing, yet it is also typified by an inherent paradox. An incredible amount of money is being poured into the supply of energy, and yet electricity failures occur almost on a daily basis. This is a paradox for the population, and in my report, I urge for more efforts to be made in order to make it clear to the people in Kosovo that energy-saving measures will need to be stepped up, and that energy will also need to be paid for in order to achieve a more sustainable policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have received reports about misappropriations at the Kosovo Electricity company, but it is too early to draw any conclusions. I have asked UNMIK to draft a report on this, as it is UNMIK that is ultimately responsible, and I think that we will have to incorporate the results of this report in our discharge report for 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could keep on adding to the list for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows the heterogeneous and multifarious nature of the European Union's tasks to which these financial resources go. It shows, too, what varied demands are made on good budget management and proper monitoring. One might add what Mr McCartin has emphatically underlined, namely that the Commission has central administrative responsibilities only for a small part of this and that in other respects, in the Member States, thousands of payment offices for agricultural expenditure, as well as hundreds of ministries and agencies, are responsible for implementation, that is, for receiving applications for funding, examining them and granting them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McCartin, your report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the Budget for the financial year 2000 reflects the wide range of the Commission's activities, the risks and sources of error specific to each of them, the measures that need to be taken and also, of course, the deficiencies in the way the Budget was managed. It is indeed very comprehensive, and the Commission is very grateful to you for the great balance that this report demonstrates. Let me, too, thank you for your speech and for your committed involvement in the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the Committee on Budgetary Control's recommendation, by such a large majority, that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the 2000 Budget. Notwithstanding that, the report and the resolution, indeed, do anything but quiet the Commission's conscience. The report makes 144 demands of the Commission, ranging from the demand that it should submit reports on administrative measures it has taken, to the demand that it should amend laws. I cannot, of course, discuss all these demands now, but I would like to pick out a few of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Blak, on behalf of the Commission, for your work on the Development Fund and for the recommendation of discharge, which, in accordance with your own tradition – one that I greatly value – comes with numerous demands attached. You, Mr Seppänen, have played a positively historic role as rapporteur for the European Coal and Steel Community budget, and I will also thank Mrs Morgan and Mr Virrankoski. Even though your reports deal with the ways the other institutions implement their budgets, they are elements of the general European Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Staes, your report, which the Commission warmly welcomes, is one that I should like to return to later. The Commission wishes to express its thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for managing the whole discussion of the discharge so well, and, of course, the secretariat and the whole committee for their hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the 2000 Budget year's results that got a very critical reception from the Committee on Budgetary Control was the large Budget surplus of EUR 11.6 billion, which, however, was welcomed by the Finance Ministers of the Member States. I have, in fact, nothing to add to Mr McCartin's description of the positive development on the revenue side. One should naturally welcome a situation in which growth rates are higher than first expected. What should, in fact, be seen in a more critical light is the issue of how outgoings were less than estimated in the Budget. We are not talking here about agricultural or administrative expenditure, where expenditure being lower than estimated really does mean that savings have been made. In the case of the Structural Funds, though, outgoings have been deferred for a period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all the regulations that were required could in fact be adopted in time, because it was so late in 1999 that decisions were taken on the agenda, as also described by Mr McCartin. Even today, though, in 2002, we have to record that the programme has been poorly implemented. Conclusions must, then, be drawn from this for the next aid period, and even the present aid period cannot be untouched by change.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak has drawn attention to the fact that the European Development Fund had, in real terms, a substantially greater turnover of resources in 2000 than in the preceding year, so this represents a positive development. It is also clear, in view of the immense need in many ACP States that the underutilisation of resources is not about there being any lack of need<span class="italic">, </span>but often about a lack of definite projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, then, in part, gone over to subsidising these countries' budgets to a greater extent. On the one hand, this is right and proper, but, on the other, it does require new approaches to monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again point out, with reference to the forwarding of information in the discharge procedure, that the Commission always immediately posts on the Internet evaluation reports on the various programmes and the different Budget items, and that the figures on the implementation of the current Budget are sent by electronic means to the Committee on Budgetary Control on a weekly basis. The Commission is convinced that the agreement with Parliament on the forwarding of confidential information has proved its value. I must reiterate, though, that both the Commission's and OLAF's reports are covered by the rules on data protection and the protection of the confidentiality of investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also, in response to a query from the Committee on Budgetary Control, produced a further breakdown of the reports from the Member States on errors and demands for repayment in connection with the Structural Funds. Tighter controls have meant that these have been notified in greater numbers, although the Member States are often not yet monitoring to the extent prescribed. Mr McCartin, you have made critical comments on this in your report. Your criticism is one that I share. It is though, very doubtful that those Member States with federal structures will be happy to be told, as is proposed in the report, that they must change the way their competences are allocated as regards the monitoring of European funds, as this is often enshrined in their constitutions. This really does raise some very serious issues.</p>
<p class="contents">One significant topic in discussions during this discharge procedure has been – and still is – the methodology on the basis of which the European Court of Auditors decides whether or not to grant a Statement of Assurance. The Commission welcomes the Court of Auditors' willingness to discuss proposals for a changed approach to the creation of indicators for financial management that are capable of being checked and compared over a period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the report on the Commission's budget and Mrs Morgan's report demand that enquiries be made into the incidence of errors in each Directorate-General. The Court of Auditors has already made it clear that this is not in accordance with its present method of sampling, as it would require substantially more random samples than the Court of Auditors is able to carry out. I would, though, point out that the reform of the Commission saw the introduction of new monitoring standards and that the annual reports on the activities of the Directorates-General have to contain details of which standards have been complied with and how this has been done. We will be checking with the Court of Auditors what amounts can be derived from these reports and from the Directorate-General's statements for the purpose of establishing indicators that can then be compared over time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Staes, in your report on the discharge of the Director of the European Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, you express your agreement with the Court of Auditors' favourable judgment. I have several reasons for picking up on this. One is that experience with the reconstruction agency has shown that decentralised responsibility, meaning more on-the-spot decisions, is the right way to go. Another is because press reports have, in part, given the impression that accusations of mismanagement in energy supply had already been substantiated. You have again made clear that this is not the case, but that the situation continues to be unsatisfactory, and have also shown how things stood in the year 2000, when they were absolutely desolate with regard both to this power station and also to the fact that – like everywhere else in the former Eastern bloc – electricity bills were not being paid. It is also of significance that the position with regard to ownership of the power station was unclear, which meant that it could not be privatised, and that it was of enormous importance in terms of safeguarding jobs. That, too, had to be taken into account in a very thorny and politically unstable situation, in which there will, of course, have to be further developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that the Court of Auditors has thoroughly audited the Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, and done so at a very early juncture. They were on the spot themselves. The overall result of the audit by the Court is a very positive one, which is significant in so far as this work in the Balkans, and the work in Kosovo, will, in the years to come, be of great importance for policy not only on foreign affairs, but also specifically on the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch briefly on the observation and demand you made concerning the agricultural sector, especially on agricultural export refunds. Even while the discharge procedure was running its course, it was possible for some understanding on several points to be reached between the committee and my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler, something that also shows that the atmosphere between the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission has undergone positive change in the direction of directly critical, but constructive cooperation. It is not only I, myself, but also, no doubt, most of our citizens, who welcome the way that Parliament is now demanding decisions on the reduction of live animal transports, which are indeed often carried on only to get export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this plenary sitting will see the completion of the discharge procedure for the 2000 Budget. Work is simultaneously in progress on drawing up the 2003 Budget, which is expected to be the last Budget for an EU of fifteen Member States. When the EU is enlarged, the Budget will once again become more complex and more multifaceted. Until then, the Commission will use the time available to support the candidate states in their preparations for enlargement and for participation in the European funds, monitoring the introduction of the necessary measures, and itself further reforming its administrative procedures. That will call for a degree of impetus from Parliament, but especially for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you for your cooperation in the past months and will conclude by alluding to an old saying from the world of football, to the effect that the Commission is very well aware that one discharge being over always means that you have another one to face.</p>

<p class="contents">On transparency, I had an interesting time when I asked Parliament's officials if they could let me have a list of what the Commission had done on the 2000 budget in relation to those items to which Parliament had adopted amendments to the budget, in terms of both amounts of money and also remarks. I was told that, even if it were possible, it would take several months to find this information. That is totally ridiculous because, if Parliament adopts amendments to the budget, it is elementary that there should be a mechanism to follow up on those amendments to know exactly what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">The fault lies in part with Parliament, because we do not scrutinise and follow up the budget as we should. I do not blame the Committee on Budgetary Control but the individual committees which do not often take that responsibility. The fault also lies with the Commission because we need greater clarity of information in order to analyse budget implementation. There should be much better dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to identify very clearly what action has been taken on European Parliament priorities. I suspect the Commission far too often simply ignores what Parliament amends in the budget. We need to be able to indicate that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the common foreign and security policy, we need greater clarity: we are not clear on who does what. That is why I support the idea of an interinstitutional agreement setting out exactly the Commission's role in the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">On implementation, there was for the 2000 budget again a very high concentration of commitments at the end of the year for Latin America, Asia and so on. The imbalance between commitments and payments continues to give cause for concern, as indeed do the remarks of the Court of the Auditors in relation to the TACIS programme. I recognise the improvements the Commission has made – in particular the use of the website to provide information – but we have to focus on transparency and implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the implementation of the 2000 Budget is concerned, we note that although the implementation rate is incredibly low – 50% for commitment appropriations and 70% for payment appropriations – this cannot be attributed to poor management or a lack of will on the part of the Commission. It is essentially due to the fact that the Council of Ministers adopted the legal bases too late, which means that a number of items given budgetary appropriations had to be postponed.</p>
<p class="contents">We noted with satisfaction that, during 2000, the Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General increased the number of audits completed on its services. Sixty-four were performed in 2000 compared to 44 in 1999. We also noted that the amounts recoverable or reduced payments as a result of the audits has increased more than 10% of the total value of contracts. Which means that we believe that the Commission should step up its efforts, if necessary using contractual penalties to combat the improper use of subsidies or the overstatement of actual costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we noted with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors stated in the report that the management of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has improved. There are, however, some anomalies, particularly as regards, for example, the appropriations granted for staff recruitment. The average cost of recruiting a member of staff at the Lisbon monitoring centre is EUR 2 780 compared with EUR 6 610 for the Vienna monitoring centre. Having said this and all things considered, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights has no objection to granting discharge in the sector for which it is responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of those lines has been heavily criticised in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is about the expenditure in 2000 of the Synergy programme, which is a programme to further international cooperation in the energy sector, and one strongly supported by the European Parliament. I am sure you can imagine, Commissioner, our astonishment and dismay when the Commission abandoned this programme in the year 2000, cancelled a call for tenders already published, causing huge inconvenience, and proceeded to spend no money at all throughout the year 2000. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that this is unacceptable behaviour and that the relevant Commissioner is well aware of our views. I am pleased to say that remedial action has been taken and we look forward to an enhanced programme in this very important sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the Tacis programme on nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union. This has regularly been severely – and rightly – criticised in the past. It is work which is carried out in difficult conditions, in an area where slackness and inefficiency in the implementation of budgets was traditional. We note with pleasure a marked improvement and look forward to reassurance about the safety of nuclear installations in the former Soviet Union.</p>

It is there that we urgently need more efficient and transparent monitoring and controls. I say that not only because the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has responsibility for four of the agencies, but also in view of the fact that the number of agencies is constantly increasing. Today there are eleven agencies, but there will soon be 14 of them, for, as you will be aware, we will also have agencies for the safety of food, and for safety in travel by air and sea, once the issue is resolved of where they are to be based.</p>
<p class="contents">As already mentioned, our committee is responsible for four agencies, in Dublin, Bilbao, Thessaloniki and Turin, and we have, in principle, no problems with them, but this does not alter the fact that there is a fundamental problem with Parliament having only one discharge procedure for four agencies. Yes, the agencies do now have their own rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets, and Mr Kuckelkorn has already achieved a great deal. Nonetheless, though, we do need all the agencies to be treated on an equal basis, and so, today, I call on the Commission to draw up proposals to put all the agencies on an equal footing in the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this we must, above all, make appropriate changes to their legal basis, without which the future will find us still incapable of auditing the agencies satisfactorily when the Budget comes round, and that cannot be in anybody's interest. Cooperation between the committees of this House also needs to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines for the agencies drawn up in 1998 should therefore be examined from four angles: with a view to ensuring appropriate control machinery in the specialised committees and transparency in the Budget procedure, reinforcing the requirement for mutual information and clear demarcation of competences between the committees involved. Our committee will be drawing up proposals in relation to this. Let me, in conclusion, again warmly thank Mr McCartin and Mr Staes for their support so far in this regard.</p>

<p class="contents">The general approach to the discharge procedure is to look at the percentage of the budget line that is spent. If 95% or more is spent then a tick is put beside that item. If less than 80% is spent there is a black mark. But if we have the information at our disposal we should look more carefully at the achievement of goals with this money, rather than purely the fact that the money has been spent. For example, on the fifth environment action plan only 70% of the budget was spent. The reason for this is that there were not sufficient good projects; in fact some calls had no response at all. We should not give money to bad projects. However, there is one slight caveat to that: I hope our bidding systems are not becoming so bureaucratic that some potential bidders with good projects are put off from bidding at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention public health budget line B3-4301 on combating cancer. In 1999 there was a substantial under-spend on that and I am pleased to see that in 2000 it was almost fully committed including the overhang from 1999. It would be verging on the criminal not to deploy resources allocated for combating diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the environment budget of EUR 200 million – that is GBP 125 million – was only half spent in the year 2000. The reason for this was the Life projects, which make up half this budget, and which could not be spent in 2000 because the legal basis was not determined in conciliation until July 2000. I am pleased to see that the five-year project has been telescoped into a four-year project instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the substantial under spending in the budget that is largely due to the Life III lines, and bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors have not voiced concerns, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy recommends that discharge be granted in respect of the 2000 budget for the budget lines within its competence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As he so rightly highlighted, that is the bulk of the problem in terms of the surplus that this Parliament is addressing. The question to which my committee failed to receive a satisfactory answer from the Commission, was why do we allow such a situation to develop in the first place? It was predictable that in the first year of the structural fund programmes rates of implementation would be very low. Yet we were faced with wholly unrealistic budget forecast expectations and scenarios which, by definition, could not be fulfilled. So we are dealing with a situation where, in many areas, there has been almost no expenditure whatsoever under certain budget lines for the Community's structural funds. We believe this makes it much more difficult for this Parliament and my committee to scrutinise the budget adequately and rigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">As a regular item on our committee agenda, we have now decided to focus on budget scrutiny and, at each discussion, we invite the Commission and the Council to participate with us in a thorough review of expenditure within the structural fund area. But that job is made very difficult by these wholly unrealistic budgets. The Commissioner must explain how we are expected properly to evaluate a budget which is in itself extremely questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second concern really relates to the second point the rapporteur made in his opening remarks – the way in which the structural funds are currently managed. We share his concern that the regulations are overly complex and make our job, as a Parliament, of scrutinising the budget very difficult. So we have a double problem there. Many organisations, individuals, groups, associations and communities that are eligible for structural funds fail to receive their fair share because of the over-complexity of the application process. We, as a Parliament – and the other authorities charged with monitoring budgetary expenditure – have a problem in that we cannot adequately monitor expenditure to ensure value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the trans-European networks. We reiterate our view that the Commission is right to focus on fewer projects but we oppose the fact that the Commission is now planning to make a EUR 60 billion addition to the trans-European network transport budget line. We invite the Commission to comment on how they can ensure value for money when they are planning such a massive increase in expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission, and particularly Commissioner Nielson, have made a great effort to keep Parliament informed on expenditure from these funds. Developing countries that are beneficiaries of these funds deserve the adoption by Parliament of the discharge already approved by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Socialist Group and the Committee on Development, for which I am rapporteur, support this discharge. However, we would ask the Commission that in future more funds be earmarked for social development and that these be more clearly reflected, as proposed by the Committee on Development, in both the budget and the EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that next year we will be able to analyse the figures for EU aid in accordance with the OECD’s Development Aid Committee system, which will allow us to measure the impact of Community funds on the promotion of social development more accurately.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments tabled by Mr Blak himself, we have to reject those which refer to access to documents and the revision of the interinstitutional framework agreement, not because of substantive issues, for the agreement is not actually proving to be very effective, but because we cannot question, in each report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, the validity of an agreement that has been negotiated, signed and voted on by this Parliament with the participation, let us not forget, of members from that very committee. The Courts have also stated their opinion in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore understand that that matter of access to documents should not be raised in a report. On the other hand, we support the other amendments regarding audits and the management of the business development centre.</p>
<p class="contents">This exercise in the discharge of the EDF, which we ritually tackle each year, should serve as an illustration, once again, of the ridiculous situation where Parliament inspects the discharge of funds that do not figure in the Community budget, the amounts of which we are not consulted on and on whose expenditure we are only informed of <span class="italic">a posteriori</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The EDF, implemented by the Commission and theoretically controlled by Parliament, should be included within the Community budget as a fundamental quantitative and qualitative element of development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that at this time of reform of the European Union, we have the perfect opportunity to remind ourselves of this fact and I would encourage all political groups to communicate this proposal, which Parliament has supported for many years, to the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Spanish President of the Council, in his presentation to the committee, expressed the intention of giving equal opportunities policy a fixed place as a mainstream function in the complex of employment and social affairs. That has also become a necessity, as the figures show that only 6% of the resources in the European Social Fund are allocated to special measures relating to equal opportunities, whereas Parliament had asked for 15%.</p>
<p class="contents">The underutilisation of resources and the great extent to which resources have been transferred is a consequence of the problems accompanying the Structural Funds' initial operations in the programming period 2000–2006. Procedures for structural measures had to be rationalised and simplified, as they are too complex at both Community and national level, and we must now work on preventing the recurrence of such difficulties when the new programmes are to be set up in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The evaluation report on the Daphne programme became available only yesterday. What particularly interests me in it is the reasons for the low take-up of the payment authorisations in the Budget year 2000. What is most important is that women play an important role in sustainable development, and gender issues should therefore be taken into account at every stage of planning, implementing and evaluating development cooperation. I therefore request clarification as to how it is that payments for this accounted for only 59% of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities focuses on just a few Budget items, but they are all the more important for enabling the objectives of equal opportunities policy to continue to be pursued in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are manifest problems originating in the Commission's system and in the way it works. Hence it cannot be acceptable that there should be, at the end of 2000, a sum of EUR 6 billion available and yet unused. It cannot be the case, in view of the increasing destitution in many ACP countries, that the Commission is unable to manage to get the funds made available to those who are in need of them. The Commission has made a start on changing the system in these areas. It has, since the Cotonou agreement, been going further down the road of giving aid in the form of sectoral budget support programmes. Put in simple terms, that means that the Commission has more faith in the recipient countries' responsibility. That is, in itself, a way of going about things that should be welcomed. The only thing is that this trust must, of necessity, be counterbalanced, in the event of misuse, by a consistent demand for the money to be returned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is such consistency that is evidently lacking, as the Court of Auditors noted that, whilst the Commission carries out audits, and also spots abuses, not one cent of the EUR 14 million referred to by the Court of Auditors had been reclaimed or retrieved. Here, the Commission must summon up the courage to state the reasons for this. Either this is the fault of its own incompetent administration, or there are general political reasons for refraining from demanding the money back.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that this will prove to be the scratch test for the new system of finance. If greater trust is placed in the recipient states, that presupposes that the recipients are fully answerable for any misuses. Everything else strikes me as inconsequential and as not in the long-term interests of the recipients. Here, the Commission must come to a definite decision and must not go down the road of least resistance, more comfortable though that would no doubt be.</p>
<p class="contents">We are left with criticism of a few of this EDF process's anachronisms, with which we have long been acquainted and which ought to be done away with as quickly as possible. If Parliament is to give discharge, then it is Parliament to which budgetary and legislative power over the EDF's resources should be conceded. The Statement of Assurance, too, which is given by the Court of Auditors in its report on the EDF, must, like the Statement of Assurance on the General Budget, involve a complete audit and must not stop at the point where the funds leave the Commission level. Here, too, is the explanation of why there is a favourable Statement of Assurance relating to the EDF. The existence of two different Statements of Assurance is not only confusing, but also deceptive.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the discharge for Parliament's budget, where Parliament must be especially careful to avoid the least whiff of the suggestion that it might treat its own funds with less rigour than it treats those of others. I wish to expressly emphasise the demand in the chapter on personnel policy in Mr Virrankoski's report that the meagre representation of women in positions of leadership should at last be ended and that there be a serious attempt at an equal opportunities policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's Secretary-General bears personal responsibility for this. Parliament must set an example if it does not want to lose its credibility. It is something more than sad that the Secretary-General has not seized these opportunities throughout the long years he has been in office. I also think that Parliament must play an exemplary role in creating an independent internal audit department, meaning that the auditors would not be subject to directions of any kind from the Directors-General and the Secretary-General. We also welcome the right to make reports directly to the President of Parliament. The report on the discharge of the Parliamentary Budget must neither cover up omissions and deficiencies, nor should it be misused in order to have internal problems dealt with elsewhere, which is what seems to be the objective of several amendments that have been reintroduced in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Financial Regulation is not suited to solving problems within Parliament. These we have to sort out ourselves. Transparency, regularity and responsibility for one's colleagues are principles which, as Mr Blak said, are self-evident in the Parliamentary context. They are not suited to the settlement of party-political disputes, and there should not, therefore, be constant and self-tormenting calls for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by asking you to support my Amendment No 8 to Mr McCartin's report. It instructs the President of Parliament even now to defend Parliament's rights under Article 276 of the Treaty establishing the European Community before the European Court of Justice in the event of the Council again proceeding to restrict them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kuhne (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, my predecessors on the floor having almost all exceeded their speaking time by at least a minute, I crave your indulgence if I have to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">When this discharge procedure began last December with the Court of Auditors' report, I pointed out that we were now entering a stage in which we are talking about the systematic problem of the European Union's Budget policy and are less concerned with chasing after every potential or actual scandal. Two aspects indicate this, namely the comparatively small number of amendments before us to all the reports and the broad majorities by which they have been adopted, likewise the way that the prospect of this debate on the discharge has made comparatively few waves in the press.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to say something very definite on the subject of Parliament. I want to pick up a point mentioned by Mrs Stauner, who spoke immediately before me. It is indeed true that it would be desirable for Parliament to be able to settle legally and entirely autonomously all the matters concerning the way it manages its budget. It would be marvellous, and I would support it, but the one problem with it is that no separation of Parliament's financial policies and the groups represented in Parliament is provided for in the European Union's Financial Regulation. It is, though, such a separation that we need.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that, two years ago, on the occasion of the Court of Auditors' report on the groups' financial policies, we had a great debate in this House, in which certain dubious financial practices on the part of individual groups reflected on the institution of Parliament as a whole and all Members of this House were seen by those in the galleries and by the press as having to answer for things which were in fact the responsibility only of individual groups. I would not wish to be made answerable for certain questionable financial practices that might well go on in other groups, and I likewise assume that, if something goes wrong in my group, Members belonging to other groups are not made answerable for them either.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Virrankoski's report now gives us the opportunity to take a significant step towards separating the responsibilities of Parliament's authorities and of the groups. It is a step that we must take. I warn against standing up and saying: How did we come to this pass, where we let the Commission, in a legislative proposal on the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation, prescribe what we should and should not do? We would then be creating a tremendous sham conflict with the Commission, in which we would show off our wondrous strength, and one side-effect would be that the separation of the responsibilities of the House authorities and the groups would be deferred for ever and a day; another side-effect – perhaps an agreeable one – would be that certain things that were done in the past, could be carried on with.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, if a group dismisses a member of its staff, he or she protests his or her innocence to the House authorities and takes Parliament to an industrial tribunal. Or when accumulated and transferred leave entitlements of group staff amounting to astronomical sums have to be paid out of Parliament's budget, whilst it is actually the groups who should accept responsibility for it. So I warn against using sham conflicts to bring about such a situation in this House. If this situation is to be avoided, we can provide a draft solution by tomorrow. If, though, the situation really does arise at the end of the day in which the present state of affairs perpetuates itself, then we will call those who are responsible by the names they deserve.</p>

This is to be welcomed, in my view, and this is why I should like to congratulate Mr McCartin – and the other rapporteurs too, in fact. As far as the Commission’s attitude is concerned, I have the impression that the Commission has made every effort to accommodate the many questions asked by Parliament within a very short space of time. What is most striking about this budget is that once again there is no positive statement of assurance. And this is the first budget for which the new Commission is responsible. We, the Liberal Group, as well as others, have said time and again that we need indicators to establish whether the situation has improved or not. If we keep hearing every year that there is no positive statement of assurance, how should we explain this to the public if we subsequently keep on granting discharge? I should once again like to draw the Commission’s attention to this problem, and ask the Commission, if the Court of Auditors refuses to develop an indicator, which is what now seems to be the case, to come up with an indicator of its own which, for example, highlights the fact that a margin of error prevails in a Directorate-General, the extent of this margin, and the extent of this in other sectors. The Court of Auditors can then verify subsequently whether the technique is sound. This will give Parliament a tool to assess whether or not a situation is improving. This seems to me to be a priority for the year to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point already mentioned by Mrs Jöns is that we have noticed a steady increase in the number of agencies. Virtually every agency has its own financial rules accompanied by a complex discharge procedure. This is difficult for the many agencies. Would it not be possible for the Commission to develop a uniform model for all the agencies? This too would simplify inspection by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point concerns the clearance of accounts. We, as the Liberal Group, have tabled an amendment which extends the period which lapses before it becomes final from 24 to 36 months. This allows us as Parliament to challenge the decisions by the Commission for a slightly longer period. And in our view, it is perhaps necessary to increase the financial corrections once again. The maximum is 100%, but what is stopping us from applying more gradations, which would provide us with another way of measuring upward or downward trends? In addition, we take the view that the computerisation of customs offices in Europe should be prioritised, especially in the new countries. What specific action is the Commission taking to reinforce Europe’s future external borders, and what can we as Parliament do to improve the situation on this score?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to bring up a topic which has already been mentioned by various speakers, namely the European Union’s new foreign and security policy. Indeed, it looks as if an entirely new policy is being developed which could well escape Parliament’s attention. This is unjustified in the opinion of the Liberal Group. We think that an agreement must be concluded between the Commission, Parliament and the Council about a new interinstitutional accord, thus allowing the expenses made by the Council in this respect to be better monitored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We greatly welcome, for example, the way that Mr McCartin's report addressed the issue of export subsidies. We will be giving that more of a cutting edge by means of an amendment, as it is our opinion that the subsidy of live animal transports still leaves too many openings for fraud involving subsidies that make no sense whatever to the EU's taxpayers. We consider this issue to be extremely important, and one where things need to be further tightened up.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be supporting Mrs Morgan in giving the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs discharge for the last few years but still not for 1996 and 1997. We consider it extremely important that our committee should strongly reiterate that these years saw mismanagement of travel expenses and, even more important, that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs dragged its feet in clearing up this fraud, and that not enough was done to prepare the case for OLAF. This must continue to receive critical attention, and we must strongly reiterate that rather than cloaking the issue in silence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express support for Mrs Morgan's demand that the Council be given discharge in the area of foreign and security policy, and also in internal affairs policy, all of which increasingly result in operational expenditure. I am, though, far from satisfied with the way in which the Council has dealt with these matters in the past, and I fear that it will still not give us a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, then, again press home our view that this discharge must be for real. The ‘gentlemen's agreement’ no longer applies. On this point, a definite decision has to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to express my agreement with Mr Kuhne, who spoke before me. If we are to criticise the Council in the course of the discharge procedure, we in this House must handle our own discharge very carefully. The administrative and group budgets should have been separated a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, though, to urge the Council to at last come to some decisions on the parties, where we in Parliament are not competent to act. We need the Council to at last decide on a party statute, which would be a practical response to public criticism on this point.</p>

This splendid work has led the majority to recommend giving discharge. Because of the little time available, I am unable to go into details concerning these many matters, just as others cannot either, but I would refer you to the excellent observations made by my colleagues, Mr Virrankoski, Mr Blak and Mrs Morgan. I shall concentrate on Mr McCartin’s report on discharge to the Commission. I should like to quote from two recitals. Recital L reads: “whereas 2000 was marked by a significant increase in the volume of fraud and irregularities identified by Member States and OLAF”. Recital P reads: “whereas, in considering budget implementation in 2000, the fundamental question is to establish, firstly, the Community management features which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, secondly, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity”. There then follows a long list of incisive observations which, on being read, give the impression of our being concerned here with a South American banana republic. The EU was not established just a couple of years ago. This system has been in place since 1957, and it is wholly unsatisfactory that, year after year, we should write these reports, clearly and emphatically pointing out the errors, but that nothing improves. Next year, we shall write something which, for a change, resembles what we are writing this year, and then still give discharge. It should be noted that the criticism in Mr McCartin’s report is just as severe as that in the report on the 1996 accounts, which brought the previous Commission down. Financial management and the legislation itself are unacceptably bad. In my country, a government characterised by management of this kind would be overturned, and the officials responsible fired. It is not good enough for so much of European taxpayers’ money to disappear due to fraud and irregularities. People will simply not put up with it. This cannot be the price of cooperation in Europe. The only logical conclusion is, of course, to vote against giving discharge to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Structural Funds, under spending is even starting to have structural implications. In our view, unspent amounts should be returned to the Member States, at least after two years. This could help these Member States reduce their national debt, for example. We therefore support Amendment No 9 tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris.</p>
<p class="contents">The management of the Structural Funds requires substantial improvement. The complex Community regulations must be simplified. Coordination between the Commission and the Member States is well below par. Financial inspection is riddled with loopholes, both ex-ante and ex-post. The current financial correction system must also be changed as a matter of urgency, because it encourages Member States to cover up irregularities and fraud instead of reporting dirty tricks. We have known this for years, but the Commission and the Member States are still doing much too little to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are disappointed that the pre-accession aid programmes are not achieving their objectives by a long chalk. The findings in the special report drawn up by the Court of Auditors are disturbing. The fact that it is unlikely that the candidate countries will be able to implement the various aid programmes during this calendar year is unacceptable to us. I would ask the Commission to inform us of the present state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the European Commission which was initiated in 1999 is still not evident in terms of specific results in 2000. I trust that the Commissioner will now have some insight into the results achieved over the course of 2001. We would be interested to find out whether she would be prepared to share some of the information.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also considerable under spending in aid programmes for development cooperation. Duplication with Member States’ policies may be partly to blame for this. Would the Commission map this out for us soon? In our view, the subsidiarity principle should be taken seriously in EU development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have made the shocking discovery that each part-session in Strasbourg costs approximately EUR 11.5 million extra per week, quite apart from the environmental pollution they cause. This Parliament is forced into this situation solely in order to honour the wish of one Member State. It would therefore be fair if this Member State were to reimburse this House to the amount of the total estimated annual additional costs of EUR 138 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate them all, with one exception. I shall not name the person, since we are all friends and acquaintances here, but I cannot congratulate one rapporteur who has had his report adopted unanimously and who is tabling four amendments on behalf of his group. I do not think that this is acceptable behaviour – and I shall say no more – because, when they see the name of the rapporteur, Members will think that he has made technical amendments to a text that received a unanimous vote. I believe that a rapporteur should be honest with his fellow Members and with himself.</p>
<p class="contents">He drafts a report, which is unanimously adopted by the members of his committee – of which I am one – and then I notice that he has tabled, on behalf of his colleagues, some amendments that have a different aim. I think that this behaviour is totally unacceptable and I now urge my fellow Members and the political groups to reject these amendments. A Member cannot be both rapporteur and the author of amendments – he is either one or the other. I agree with tabling amendments to other reports, but not to one’s own report. That is why I regret that I am not able to congratulate this Member on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other reports, I would like to raise two further points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is to Mrs Eluned Morgan, a dear friend. This is 2002, the third millennium: the world is making progress, facts of law are often set in stone, so why persist in refusing the 1996-97 discharge to the smallest institution in the European Union? What will our citizens think when they find out that we have granted discharge to all the institutions, but we are delaying discharge from seven or eight years ago to the Economic and Social Committee? We have blamed and accused ECOSOC for the facts that came to light and enough is enough. For goodness’ sake, spare us the embarrassment of being haunted by this scandal, because if we must be haunted by a scandal – I assure you, Eluned – we can all drag up past scandals all over again. This is not the right approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, regarding the report by Mr McCartin – whom I would like to congratulate in particular – I want to stress that we can, of course, go over all the cases in all the Member States and highlight them, but we must not get hung up on specific cases. I therefore call for paragraph 60 to be deleted immediately and I strongly urge the Members to amend the words in paragraph 60 which relate to a Member State that I hold in great esteem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate Mrs Morgan on her discharge report. I was not in the Chamber when she made her comments about ECOSOC, but I am sure she is now with me in calling for this organisation not only not to get discharge but actually to be disbanded because it is a waste of money.</p>
<p class="contents">My primary job here on behalf of my group is to talk about the Staes and Seppänen discharges. This is very easy because they are two very good reports written by two very good parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the McCartin report, I want to put on record, especially for people in the public gallery, some of the simple facts which we should be talking about. There is still no positive statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors. This is the seventh year running. There probably never will be one because they have got themselves into a very tight corner now. How can they give discharge to an organisation where 5% or more of the budget is lost through fraud, mismanagement or waste and 14% of the budget, at least, is running as a surplus? Nearly 20% of the budget is not spent correctly, as we would like it to be. This is not a record to be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge report by Mr McCartin contains a number of quite scathing points and highlights ongoing problems within the Commission. And yet Mr McCartin comes to the conclusion that he should recommend discharge. Quite correctly, he notes that the majority of the EU's budget is administered in the Member States. However this does not absolve the Commission of final responsibility and accountability. The buck stops with the Commission. It is its responsibility, as stated in Article 274, to implement and oversee the Community's budget. Once again this is a year in which it has failed to manage and control the Community's budget properly.</p>
<p class="contents">My party's representatives in this House were elected on a whole host of pledges, the main one being to sort out the accounts of the European Commission and other European institutions and make sure that the reform process that most people in this House are pleased to see going forward is actually driven through and achieves results.</p>
<p class="contents">As much money is now being lost through fraud and mismanagement of funds in the 2000 budget as when we made the pledge in 1999 to try and sort this out. John Wiggins, a former member of the European Court of Auditors, is quoted in a British newspaper saying that the situation in the Commission is unchanged. Things have <span class="italic">got</span> to change.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's legal services wrote a note to the Budgetary Control Committee on 5 November 2001 giving an opinion on whether not granting discharge should lead to the fall of the Commission. It states that undoubtedly refusal to grant discharge is the expression of serious political sanctioning of the Commission. Its legal effect, however, is not such as to compel the Commission to resign. That is covered by a special procedure laid down in Article 141 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In voting not to give discharge to the Commission, we are actually making sure that the Commission knows firstly, that we do not want it to resign and, secondly, that we want it to sort the problems out. If nothing has changed by this time next year, if there is still no positive statement of assurance, if there is still 5% and more waste, mismanagement, fraud and disappearing money, and if there is still a huge budget surplus, then we will be getting to the stage where we will have to say to the people in the public gallery and the people who put us here that nothing has changed in the European Commission, the reform process is still ongoing – and is the slowest process ever – and we have failed in one of our core tasks which was to sort these problems out in the first place. That is not a record to be proud of and not something I am prepared to stand before my constituents and say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too greatly appreciate the work of the six rapporteurs – seven in fact, as Mr Bourlanges had no choice but to hand over to Mr McCartin halfway through. I shall confine my contribution to this debate to the report which they brought about together. This report contains four points that are central to us: firstly, the recurring request for modernising the working methods of the European Court of Auditors. As in previous years, the Court of Auditors was unable to issue a positive statement of assurance for the implementation of the 2000 Budget. This was to be expected, as the Court of Auditors’ methodology is unrelenting. One error identified in a random test of 300 transactions results in a negative judgment. The Court of Auditors is not unlike an astronomer who scours the night sky with a microscope and can only see dust particles. On the basis of current methodology, there will be no positive statement of assurance forthcoming for some time yet. Commissioner Schreyer has since acknowledged this too.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress made by the Commission in fighting fraud and irregularities must be outlined in a more readily understood format. Risk discrepancies between sectors must be mapped out. The Court of Auditors’ evaluation should mainly focus on the quality of the control systems. The development of the single-audit concept, the topic of my second point, can play an important role in this. National and European governments still operate independently of one another far too often when monitoring the spending of European money. In the McCartin report, we call for the development of a single audit model for the EU budget, in which each level of control builds on the preceding one, with a view to reducing the burden on the auditee and enhancing the quality of audit activities. Commissioner, are you prepared to look into the feasibility of this concept?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the McCartin report also draws our attention to major problems in the agricultural sector, particularly with regard to export refunds. The problems identified by the Court of Auditors once again underline the urgent need for a complete overhaul of the common agricultural policy. Mr Casaca will undoubtedly expand on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say something about the discussion surrounding Paul van Buitenen, which has flared up once again. With his inquiry into fraud and irregularities within the Commission in 1999, Paul van Buitenen made a major contribution to the removal from office of the Santer Commission and the reform process which was subsequently instigated. He has been called a hero of European democracy, with good reason. Since 1999, major changes have been made in the field of staffing policy and financial management. OLAF has received independent status. Whistle-blowers now enjoy the protection they deserve. In the middle of last year, Paul van Buitenen presented a new report, which included information about possible irregularities. All allegations in this report must be thoroughly investigated. Where necessary, disciplinary measures or even legal steps must be taken. We must avoid a situation where innocent people are wrongly pilloried, because the implications for those involved, but also for the Commission, are all but incalculable. We are satisfied with the way in which the Commission is handling things for the moment. We have no reason to question the integrity of OLAF or any other parties involved. We are waiting for the results of the inquiry and will then pass judgment. This is what we have agreed and we are adhering to this. The PSE Group supports the proposal to grant discharge to the Commission for the implementation of the 2000 Budget, and I warmly congratulate Commissioner Schreyer on this outcome; it is, after all, the first budgetary year for which she has been fully responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, the discharge procedure is a fundamental part of our work and is one of the distinguishing powers of our institution: the power by virtue of which we verify, year after year, that the good intentions and resolves, and also the expectations of the citizens who elected us and for whom we are responsible first and foremost, are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject is both extremely technical and extremely political, and the consequences for both sectors of decisions taken in haste or under emotional stress can be – and, unfortunately, do often turn out to be – disastrous. That is why I feel that we should ask ourselves before the vote, each year, not so much whether everything has been done perfectly but rather whether we are going in the right direction, whether we are setting ourselves the right priorities, whether, in the executive action of the Commission and – to a much lesser extent – all the other institutions, there is evidence of the intention to implement the will of the two arms of the budgetary authority as well as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Concentrating especially on Mr McCartin’s report and, therefore, on the Commission’s budget, I feel that three points warrant particular emphasis; indeed, the rapporteur himself has already stressed them. Firstly, the financial year 2000 has been characterised by an exceptional level of overspending with regard to the budget, which shows that the budgetary forecasts were severely short of the mark. Secondly, although 2000 marked the start of a new programming period for the Structural Funds and preacession aid which stretches until 2006, this cannot have been very successful given that so many difficulties were encountered in implementation. Lastly – and this point may well be more important than the previous two – the rapporteur was right to point out the need to establish, on the one hand, the features of Community management which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, on the other, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity</p>
<p class="contents">These are, in my opinion, the areas we must address if we are to achieve proper, sound implementation of the budget in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for these is still the weak points in the legislation, cooperation between national authorities that is poor or utterly lacking in coordination, and excessive laxity in monitoring and in imposing penalties. This is again confirmed in the reports before us on the discharge procedure for 2000. The Court, for example, did not name Member States that were negligent. These Member States, whose lax monitoring undermines the combating of fraud, should not only be shown up, but should also make good the damage their laxity causes to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF's work in connection with the travel expenses affair was equally inadequate. In order to stem fraud, though, we also need radical reform of Europe's VAT system, for example, by abolishing the deduction of tax within the enterprise chain at national level as well, as it at present strongly favours VAT fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are still some problems, however. Generally speaking, there is a unanimous call for the modernisation of public authorities and for the process to be further simplified, which would give rise to greater transparency and better public understanding as a whole, whilst bringing this important process closer to the EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we gave our support to the rest of the reports, I would like to make a particular reference to a report on which our group, the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, abstained – the Morgan report. With regard to this report, we do not agree with the rapporteur or with the committee outcome in several regards.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand all that has been said in this House with regard to the irregularities of the Economic and Social Committee in 1996 and 1997. This period, when there were some administrators who did not do their job properly, when many investigations were carried out, when documentary proof was requested and that which was available was surrendered seems like a long time ago. It is true to say that today there are new administrators and new procedures; there is now no problem, as demonstrated by the 1998, 1999 and 2000 discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that we can accept this slur on an organisation which cooperates with the other institutions, such as the European Parliament, particularly when the current administrators have done all they can to clear up all of these irregularities. We believe, however, that the best thing that we can do is to draw a line under this whole affair, put this case of poor administration behind us and to give the Economic and Social Committee a new opportunity to maintain a good relationship with Parliament in the future, a good relationship with Parliament and to properly represent all social administration – as it has up until now – and for it to be one of the most effective bodies in the European Union – one of the oldest, if not the oldest – of all those we are analysing today in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a discrepancy that we therefore hope will be cleared up when we vote in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">We also disagree with the rapporteur’s proposals with regard to the Council. We believe that the Council discharge should be approved. Foreign and defence policy are recent issues. We have to look at things from a different perspective. I believe that the rapporteur could take steps to facilitate a more appropriate solution by taking the opinions of the Group of the Europe People’s Party into account. If this is not the case, we will have to vote against the report. We hope that this matter is cleared up and that, if this is not the case, this part of the report can be sent back to the committee, in order to facilitate the development of the aforementioned foreign and defence policy for, as I say, we should not continue with the current approach, given that we have to achieve a better understanding and a better clarification of procedures carried out to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise the constructive and genuinely European attitude demonstrated by our fellow Member, Mr McCartin, and the support given by the staff of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The McCartin report is an important part of the process of reforming the common policy. I hope that the remaining European institutions take due account of this, preparing the necessary measures for the phasing out of refunds for farm exports and ensuring that these refunds are used instead for the purpose laid down by the Treaty, which is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for the rural population.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say, however, that where fraud in the food industry is concerned, we need to go considerably further. Speaking of dairy products – a sector that is quite crucial to the Azores – I cannot accept a situation in which farmers live in a state of constant fear of being fined for overproduction while European criminal organisations are falsifying tens of thousands of tons of butter with the complicity of the major European dairy product groups and while the dairy industry is receiving subsidies for powdered milk, which is basically whey, while major dairy produce companies are selling the equivalent of hundreds of millions of litres of what purport to be dairy products, but are, in fact, counterfeit products that are not made from milk. Nor can I accept that the Commission has had very little or nothing to say on this issue!</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, if we look at other fields, such as oil, wine, or even meat, the picture is not very different. Fraud in the food industry, which is often perpetrated in order to obtain export or disposal refunds, is now one of the greatest problems facing the budgetary control of agriculture. We therefore urge the Commission to rapidly establish an initiative in this field that will enable this state of affairs to be brought to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this news, particularly in the present climate of political hostilities in various parts of the world. It is a clear demonstration that the political process and the peace process are well under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I link that with the budget debate? Well, in discussing the budget, it is important to note the important role that the European Union and the European Parliament have played in this peace process through the International Fund for Ireland, the establishment of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, INTERREG and the removal, through the Single Act, of the economic border which affected the border region for many years. So it is relevant to refer to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to commend my colleague, Mr McCartin, for his thorough and comprehensive work on the very important matter before us. The power that we have in Parliament, which we share as the Union's budgetary authority, is perhaps the greatest responsibility that we have. We are talking of EUR 100 billion of public money. We have a duty to subject this expenditure to the highest standards of scrutiny. Parliament may have the final say in signing off the accounts, but it is important to recall that 84% of the Community budget is managed within the Member States. It is also important that a strong culture of openness and cooperation exists between the Commission, the national, regional and local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the largest part of the budget goes to the common agricultural policy, one of only a few truly common policies in the Union. It has served us well and must be maintained and defended. I am concerned at some suggestions that export refunds should be ended and I reject any notion that export refunds are somewhat inherently conducive to fraud. I remain convinced that refunds constitute a fundamental element of the policy; they play an important role in the management of agricultural markets and must be defended at WTO level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is something we have not seen for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to congratulate the rapporteurs most warmly, but would also like to mention that the highest levels of the Commission were represented in many of our meetings, and this made management easier – something mentioned by you, Mrs Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">To give or withhold discharge is actually the greatest power Parliament possesses, in which Parliament is superior to the Council, and that is why it is a highly political instrument. Let me emphasise that again. This time, the judgment on the way that the Budget was managed in 2000 was indeed lenient, especially, too, in the report on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would just like to mention three points, and briefly. One is the issue of the large surplus that remains. I am less concerned about whether this money reverts to the Member States or is set off, than that it should not be used to achieve political objectives, especially in the areas of structural policy and enlargement, and that makes me very vigilant. There is room for improvement here, and another surplus of this sort for 2001 will not be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the Statement of Assurance that the Court of Auditors did not grant. This instrument is evidently not that fully applicable. It is very difficult for us, in the absence of percentages of errors, to judge whether errors have been committed, and how many.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I wish to address is that of monitoring, in which field the Commission, being responsible for the Member States and also, already now, for the candidate countries – one can take Chapter 28 as an example – must take great care that the European Union's financial interests are effectively safeguarded. I therefore see the Green Paper on the creation of a European public prosecutor as showing the way ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One cannot but wonder for a moment why we spend months here on the Budget process if 14% of a Budget is not utilised. I know, as we all do, that the underutilisation in 2001 was even greater than it was in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">If, against that, we set the fact that the same year, 2000, also saw a doubling of the irregularities and frauds that were recorded in this Budget, then, in Budget matters, the first year of Mr Prodi's Commission seems not to have been much of a success. But, Mr McCartin, this does not mean assigning the debt to the Member States! Commissioner Schreyer has already referred to the desire to make use of the time for enlargement, in order to prepare these countries for it. So I ask the same Commission what is happening about the implementation of pre-accession aid in the context of agricultural policy, which was demonstrably not implemented at all in 2000 and 2001. The same Commission proposes to the European Union that enlargement should take place in 2004. How, then, is that to be done? Either the countries desirous of joining are – to put it in plain language – too stupid to collect money they have been given, or the Commission is not in a position to devise pre-accession programmes that are, at the end of the day, capable of being implemented!</p>
<p class="contents">Today already, Commissioner, we can take it for granted, for example, that a programme such as IACS, that is, all the agricultural monitoring systems about which we have had so much to say, cannot be implemented for years on end if these countries are onboard, one of many reasons being that the Commission has overslept and missed the pre-accession programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it highly important, Commissioner, that we should, in the years to come, not spend all our time speculating about who should hand over which documents to whom – if any at all – and estimates differ as to how great this agreement between Parliament and the Commission is. What this is about is that you at last grasp that you are accountable to the European public for all of what you have utilised – or, in this instance, not utilised – right down to the last cent. Then, it is to be hoped, we will enter the new culture of political management in Brussels that Mr Prodi has, admittedly, promised us, but which has not, to date, been discernible.</p>

His years of experience and expertise in this field make him eminently qualified to deal with such an important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The largest part of the budget, of course, goes to fund the common agricultural policy, and this is an important community measure which must not be undermined. This summer the Commission is due to publish its proposals for the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. This was agreed in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that this review is not used in any way as a means of reforming the policy at this particular time. This must be deferred until agreement is reached on agriculture at the world trade talks. Suggestions, for example, that export refunds should be ended, would have disastrous consequences, particularly for Ireland where we export up to 90 percent of our entire agricultural production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I cannot deal with all its contradictions, I cannot but denounce the truly futile calculations it contains with reference to personnel and other costs at our various places of work. All of these are intended to run Luxembourg and Strasbourg down as places of work, to glorify an unhealthy emphasis on the centrality of Brussels and to undermine the decisions under the Treaty which laid down Strasbourg and Luxembourg as places of work. These were enshrined in the Treaty and cannot therefore be altered by Parliament, thank God! Nor should they, of course, be eroded without further ado, be it by the administration, by the bureau, or by a small majority in Parliament using devious means and our calendar of part-sessions.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me as positively perverse for this report to welcome a reduction in the number of journeys on official business that our officials take from Luxembourg to Brussels and back, and for it to be boasted that, in 2000, EUR 2.8 million was saved in this way, ignoring the fact that these figures conceal enforced transfers of lower and middle-stream officials from Luxembourg to Brussels, which their families find traumatic and socially and financially intolerable. Someone has also forgotten to state what additional costs are incurred through sending hundreds of officials to Strasbourg from Brussels every month, instead of from Luxembourg, thus, of course, resulting in greater expense. The intention which comes to light is a disconcerting one.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, Strasbourg gets more of the same treatment when it is mentioned that the variable costs of the five-day part-sessions in Strasbourg are 33% higher than for those in Brussels. I would like to propose that creative accountant for the Guinness Book of Records! What is certain is that Parliament's nonsensical decision to cut the Strasbourg part-sessions down to four days led to the costs per day of the part-sessions now being substantially higher, quite apart from this plenary not having the time to deal properly with business, especially with legislative texts! What is praised for being good value turns out, in the final analysis, to be substantially more expensive. The ratio of price to quality is quite simply wrong, and that is what I wanted to take this opportunity to say loudly and clearly!</p>

Mr McCartin took on this report at short notice, as I myself was due to draft it, and he has worked on this task in a very able and rigorous manner. His report is a balanced, reasonable and positive piece of work. I would personally like to praise him and I sincerely hope that the report is adopted. Mr McCartin is right to recommend the discharge. The problems raised are not so much problems regarding the timing in the implementation as problems related to an increasing lack of realism, as has been said, between, on the one hand, the financial perspectives that were set in Berlin and the budgetary forecasts that the Commission sets on an annual basis, and, on the other hand, the genuine needs arising from the implementation of the budgets. We must take steps to correct this imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Morgan report, I support Mrs Avilés Perea’s comments on the fact that we cannot support the refusal to discharge the Economic and Social Affairs Committee’s budget for the two consecutive financial years since this body made a considerable effort to improve the situation and because it is never a good idea to respond to the positive reform which has got underway by maintaining sanctions. I therefore believe that the committee’s positive efforts call for a positive response on our behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Virrankoski report, I support the comments Mrs Lulling made earlier on the problems raised by paragraphs 25 and 33 of the resolution. We may well agree to have a single place of work for Parliament in Brussels, but, until the Treaty specifies otherwise, if the Treaty provides for several places of work, it is our duty to ensure that this work can be carried out in the appropriate conditions. Paragraphs 25 and 33, however, seem to insidiously call into question the provisions of the Treaty. Mr Van Hulten told us that the Treaty was desired by one single Member State, so I leave you to draw your own conclusions from this. The Treaty is the expression of a collective will, the expression of political balance and we must all respect this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to suggest that the specific questions raised by the rapporteurs of the individual committees should also be discussed in those committees with my colleagues. We have agreed a new procedure for working together on setting priorities for next year, in which context, during April and May, there are to be many bilateral discussions between the relevant committees and the Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">When talking about the priorities for the forthcoming year, one must also, of course, draw on the experience of past years. The Commission will of course, in the coming months, be working on the other issues and demands raised in the reports and will give an account of this work in the follow-up report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have indeed seen that these discussions have, much more than in the past, focused on structural issues in budget management and implementation, and also on reliability testing. These issues will no doubt leave their mark on joint discussions in the coming months. As regards the methods used by the Court of Auditors to produce a Statement of Assurance, it goes without saying that we are prepared to look deeper into this concept and the idea of a single audit, in order to enhance and improve the coordination between the Court of Auditors and the checks carried out on the spot by the Internal Audit Service on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to enlargement, the admittedly great delay in the agricultural programme has shown that it is sometimes necessary to give priority to the requirements of monitoring. This has necessitated great restructuring on the part of the candidate countries in which the individual paying agencies are now gradually being accredited. We hope that this year will then see the start of disbursements to the farmers.</p>
