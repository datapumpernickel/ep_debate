<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has equipped itself with a politically independent Central Bank, responsible for safeguarding price stability. The ECB must, at the very least, be financially independent. Pursuant to the Treaty, the Bank’s initial capital is fixed at EUR 5 billion while foreign exchange reserves are fixed at EUR 50 billion. As the European System of Central Banks is currently composed of only 11 national central banks, the capital released is only EUR 3.9 billion, while currently transferred reserves come to only EUR 39.46 billion. Of that, 15% are in gold, while the remaining 85% consist of US dollars and yen. It should be noted that interest on its own capital is the European Central Bank’s only reliable source of income. In the short term, this income varies with interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB’s other source of income is the interest on its official reserves. However, from that income the ECB has to deduct the interest it pays on its liabilities in euros vis-à-vis the national central banks. The foreign exchange reserves that appear on the ECB’s balance sheet are given in national currencies, while the liabilities vis-à-vis the national central banks are given in euros.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, given the interest rate differentials between the euro on the one hand, and the US dollar and the yen on the other, the net income from interest is positive. However, in the event that interest rates vary, and to the extent that the source of income is highly sensitive to interest rate differentials, the share of income accruing from interest could fall very quickly and even produce a loss. Since the ECB holds currencies to offset liabilities in euros, it would also run a foreign exchange risk if the euro appreciated substantially against the reserve currencies it is holding.</p>
<p class="contents">An internal ECB calculation indicates that the foreign exchange value at risk could exceed the ECB’s current capital. A 10% depreciation of the US dollar and the yen against the euro, accompanied by a 10% fall in the price of gold, would wipe out all the ECB’s existing capital. The Treaty provides for a mechanism whereby the ECB can forearm itself against any erosion of its capital. The European Central Bank can partially or totally retain the monetary income from the Eurosystem. Nevertheless, a central bank that depended on being bailed out repeatedly would not be very credible. In fact, the European Central Bank will probably close its 1999 financial year with a deficit of more than EUR 200 million. So it is imperative to resolve this structural problem as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 April 1999, the European Parliament endorsed an ECB recommendation on doubling its capital in the long term. The recommendation under consideration today seeks to authorise the Governing Council to effect further calls of foreign reserves, raising the ceiling to EUR 100 billion. So it is simply a question of authorisation in principle to increase reserves as needed, without being pressurised by exceptional events. The ECB might, for example, make use of this procedure to augment them on a case-by-case basis, particularly during a period of large-scale intervention, but also, possibly, because of potential portfolio losses, the portfolio being revalued every quarter according to market rates.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it must be noted that the total reserves of the Eurosystem come to more than EUR 350 billion. As President Duisenberg maintained at his last hearing before the European Parliament, the ECB does not intend to intervene on the foreign exchange markets to try to influence the external value of the euro. In the event of another international financial crisis, which remains possible given the irrational exuberance of the markets, there could be a need for concerted intervention by the main central banks.</p>
<p class="contents">To enable the ECB to be a party to agreements such as those known as the Plaza or Louvre agreements, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs felt it was clearly necessary to advise Parliament to vote for the recommendation. I have not proposed what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues. Personally, as I said a while ago, I feel that Parliament votes on too many resolutions and that this inflated number of resolutions reduces the value of other, politically essential resolutions. In this case it is a question of saying yes or no. A massive yes vote also sends out a political message.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the ECB to be able to pursue its main objective of safeguarding price stability in total independence – including material independence. At the same time, and here Mr Duisenberg is being too evasive for my liking, we also want the European System of Central Banks to give its unequivocal support to the European Union’s general economic policies. We want the Central Bank to play its full part on the international scene and to make an active contribution to defining new rules that will enable the international financial system to operate without crises. We are confident that the Governing Council will make optimum use of the foreign exchange reserves in the Eurosystem in the event of tension on the markets. </p>
<p class="contents">No one claims that the deterrent effect of the foreign exchange intervention instrument is proportional to the amount of reserves. However, credibility is enhanced by the option of being able to mobilise additional assets at any time without delay. It would be warranted, however, for such internal ECB transfers, which will not be included in detail in the Eurosystem’s weekly consolidated financial statements, to be disclosed <span class="italic">a posteriori</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also assumes that the ECB President will explain the decisions taken by his Council when he appears before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, indeed, during plenary debates. The Central Bank has everything to gain from this improved transparency with regard to consolidating its credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will close my statement by emphasising, speaking for myself and addressing myself to the ECB, that the ECB is there to serve the women and men of Europe, to serve the economy as a whole. So its role is not just to satisfy the expectations of the financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I should like to carry on from the point at which the rapporteur stopped in his report, for which I thank him, and point out once again that, compared with the plethora of resolutions which do not equate with the priorities of this House, increasing foreign reserve assets is an important resolution. What is the legal basis for today’s debate? According to Article 3 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, owning and managing official foreign reserve assets is one of the tasks of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">This task is carried out in parallel by the ECB and the national central banks, whereby the national central banks transfer part of their reserves up to the equivalent of 50 billion euros to the European Central Bank, in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute. It was decided at the time, in Article 30.4 – which is why today’s discussion comes as no surprise – that the ECB could call up further foreign reserve assets beyond the limit set in Article 30.1. This call must be issued in the form of a regulation by the EU Council. The ECB is currently calling for a further increase of 50 billion euros.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the entire Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as the rapporteur has already said, welcome this proposal. The reasons are set out in detail and time is already marching on, but allow me to say that we consider that this increase is needed. First, because it will help to increase the financial independence of the ECB, and the independence of the European Central Bank is instrumental to the stability and unassailability of the currency. The return on the capital paid up so far and the official reserves currently represents the ECB’s only source of income for financing its operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that it sustained a loss in 1999. We must therefore admit that a lack of funds robs the ECB of the ability to formulate an independent and transparent policy. Its financing requirements must be covered so that its independence cannot be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are in favour of this increase because it will help to foster the credibility of the ECB on the markets. If the ECB is financially independent and self-sufficient, this will increase its credibility on the international markets and, by extension, strengthen the euro <span class="italic">en route </span>to the third stage on 1.1.2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: this increase will enhance the ability of the ECB to react and adapt. In the event of a serious imbalance on the markets, possibly doubling its reserves gives the European Central Bank the potential to carry out its task in the form of a stability policy more effectively. It gives it the possibility to react more flexibly because it has the necessary funds at its disposal. Our report also introduces an additional model for strengthening the transparency of this procedure and I would therefore ask that you vote in favour of increasing the reserves.</p>

The following reasons are given: first, the Treaty makes provision for this. If it is not applied in the form of a regulation, this could be construed as a difference of opinion between the ECB and the Council. Secondly, the ECB should gain in financial independence. Thirdly, the foreign exchange intervention instrument will be made more credible and the capacity of the ECB to adjust to various scenarios will be fostered.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there can be no objection to any structural improvement of the ECB’s financial situation. The only question is whether or not pouring more money into it will solve the problem once and for all. Before an answer can be given, the following questions at least must be considered:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: does it make political and economic sense to apply the sort of restrictive monetary policy which the ECB applies and which is more restrictive than the FED? Secondly, does the increase in interest rates for top refinancing facilities and deposit facilities applied on 9.2.2000 not run counter to economic growth? Thirdly, are more decisive measures to reduce unemployment permanently not the most tried and tested means of guaranteeing price stability?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: in addition to a supply-orientated economic policy, should greater emphasis not be placed on a demand-orientated economic policy, i.e. strengthening the European internal market through reduced import tax rates in the Member States? Fifthly, is it so wrong to assume that the exchange rate set when the euro was introduced had more to do with political wishful thinking than economic reality? Sixthly: what specific grounds are there for assuming that the ECB will probably sustain a loss in 1999?</p>
<p class="contents">Having answered these questions, our Group felt unable to vote for the proposal for a resolution. Not because the ECB has too few foreign reserve assets, but because it is wrongly organised structurally and will therefore complain endlessly of these liquidity problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To that end, it puts forward two very different kinds of argument.</p>
<p class="contents">The first dwell on its own concerns about financial administration, given that the increase in its staff appears proportional to the fall in income from its assets, income one might in fact have hoped would be sufficient to make it self-supporting.</p>
<p class="contents">In a flash of lucidity, the ECB has declared that a central bank with a structural deficit would quite simply not be credible. That is true, and it gives some cause for anxiety about the administrative ability of those who so quickly need to raise the ceiling level.</p>
<p class="contents">The second argument is that the ECB needs to enhance its capacity to intervene on the markets in a general context of the depreciation of the euro – contrary to the soothing forecasts we were originally favoured with – and of repeated attacks by the financial centre of one EU Member State which, it has to be said, was wise enough not to join the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">So it did not take long before the supposed instrument of EU independence and economic power so cruelly demonstrated its inadequacies. It is rather shattering to read in the report that, should the political authorities – Parliament and the Council – refuse to help to bring about a structural improvement in the financial position of the ECB, the latter would no longer be regarded as independent by the markets. It is clear to see where the ECB’s priority lies; it has acquired the habit of facing the policy makers with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> and its main aim is to gain the respect of the financial centres, to which it evidently attaches more value than to the confidence of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">No, really, we care little whether the ECB does or does not double its nuisance value. We would have preferred some genuine self-criticism on the part of those who are genuinely responsible, namely the governments of the Fifteen, and a policy reversal, which would enable the people of the Member States to free themselves from the fate of standardisation that is being prepared for them by an ill-assorted group made up of technocrats who believe in the divine right of federalism and of globalised speculators.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goebbels points out that rejection by Parliament could be construed as indicating profound disagreement with the soundness of the policy pursued by the European Central Bank. That is reason enough for us to vote against this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first sight it may seem acceptable to raise the current ceiling from EUR 50 billion – in fact it is 39.5 billion because certain countries have not joined the single currency – to EU 100 billion, when we remember that the national central banks will still have EUR 300 billion of own official reserves available. However, the fact that this operation is to take place so soon after the date when the single currency was launched clearly shows that the value of the reserves was seriously underestimated at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Aside from a few technical explanations relating to details, such as the exact number of ECB staff, there is only one valid reason that can be cited: the euro-optimism surrounding the launch of the euro, as it was called at the time, led people to believe that the single currency would naturally be strong and that the question of reserves was, therefore, secondary. They all seem to be becoming rather more realistic again now. But the whole business is not yet closed, for the explanatory memorandum in the draft regulation, like the explanatory statement in the European Parliament’s report, are rather disturbing, pointing out as they do, in passing, that the aim of raising the ceiling is, and I quote, to enhance the Bank’s “ability to adapt to different possible scenarios”. Since this does not refer to a scenario where the value of the euro is rising – if that were so, there would obviously be no need for additional reserves – it must mean a scenario where its value is falling. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s report seems even more alarmist when it refers in so many words to the potential instability of the euro which, according to the rapporteur, does not need to be demonstrated. This slip of the pen will no doubt displease Mr Duisenberg who, for his part, keeps reiterating day after day that the euro is fundamentally stable. Yet it is a revealing slip of the pen. For it is, in effect, not realistic to believe that an artificial currency can inspire the same confidence as a currency solidly established among the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has been consulted by the Council – as it has been by Parliament – about the recommendation of the European Central Bank concerning further calls of foreign reserve assets to the ECB. The Commission has adopted its opinion on this recommendation on 8 March, which reads as follows: “Noting the rights of initiative of both the Commission and the ECB, the Commission has agreed with the initiative taken by the European Central Bank. The Commission supports the doubling of the limit for calls of foreign reserve assets by the ECB to the extent that these further calls serve to replenish holdings of reserve assets up to the initial limit of EUR 50 billion fixed in the ESCB Statute”.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore adopted a favourable opinion on the ECB’s recommendation. Should Parliament adopt the report of Mr Goebbels in its present form, this would mean that Parliament’s and the Commission’s views converge, which I would welcome.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
