In addition, there has been considerable progress made in research and development over the decades and, for that reason too, it is naturally a good idea to review matters. Furthermore, the accession of Sweden, Austria and Finland meant that the EU’s forest resources immediately doubled. On account of all this, it is excellent that these reviews and adjustments are being undertaken. In addition, there is the matter of harmonisation with OECD schemes. That is also a good thing and will enable us in future to trade in this material beyond the borders of the EU, which should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The material in question has now been classified into four categories, whereas previously there were two. This now guarantees there will be a sort of certificate, a guarantee that the right goods get to the right place. It ensures that no errors – which the large afforested countries of the north have also experienced – occur. Details relating to the area of provenance must also be defined on a map. The maps are to be sent to the Commission and a comprehensive list of goods associated with forest reproduction must also be kept.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled numerous amendments, and they were mainly targeted at the timetable for implementation. The Commission had proposed too tight a schedule and, for that reason, the entry into force of the directive has been postponed until 2003, so that the Member States can revise legislation as called for by this directive. The transition period for some countries was also taken into account and thus the period of transition was increased by a couple of years for those countries whose period of transition would otherwise have expired. In some countries there are rather large stocks because good seed years only occur at intervals of 10 to 15 years, and so the seeds have to be stored for very long periods of time in order that stocks are not exhausted. The possibility of utilising and exhausting stocks was a very important issue, as has been remarked upon in this report. In addition, we spoke a lot about genetic resources. That is a very sensitive issue at the moment and, naturally, we tried to bring this proposal in line with EU practice. Similarly, this proposal also consider the health of plants and changes in their health.</p>
<p class="contents">As I understand it, there will be two more amendments to this report in tomorrow’s vote, if I may be allowed to comment briefly on them. As rapporteur, I can agree with Amendment No 23 if three words are added to the recital where the amendment will appear: “special climatic conditions of certain regions, such as the Alps, the Mediterranean and northern regions”. If this is added I will be able to agree to it, as rapporteur. As for Amendment No 24, which has also been made for tomorrow, I can state that this amendment is now already incorporated into Article 4(3)(a), which is a new subparagraph and which was added for precisely this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The expression <span class="italic">of known origin</span> will make it possible to maintain the genetic and biological diversity of the forest in local regions and on land given over to forests. True, our forests are certainly producers of renewable material, but they are also infinitely more than just raw materials. The forest is also home to a great diversity of biological life. It is also an important means of trapping carbon dioxide and it is perhaps the earth’s most important regulator of the climate and water supply. </p>
<p class="contents">The forest also has a spiritual dimension. It represents peace and quiet, silence and tranquillity for stressed-out urban men and women, especially if they were born in the northern dimension. It is therefore important that forests be treated as diverse in their own right and as having a diversity of functions. I therefore repeat that I am very glad that, as the proposal now reads, there exists this opportunity to maintain the genetic and biological diversity of the forests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak on behalf of my group when I say that we fully support the rapporteur. Europe is a continent rich in forests and forests are tremendously important. We should all bear in mind the fact that the use of forests is not only in the economic interest, it is, above all, in the environmental interest of all of us. What I mean is that forests have a multi-functional role.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you today of the major avalanche catastrophe a year ago in Galtür because it demonstrates how important it is for all of us to treat nature with respect; the alpine area in particular is a very sensitive zone, as people who know the area are obliged to testify time and time again. Not only the people who live in the Alps, but everyone who likes to go on skiing or walking holidays in the Alps each year, appreciates an intact mountain environment in which the dangers are kept to a minimum. The reforestation of the Bannwald is particularly important. That is why reproductive material, which guarantees that forests will withstand the harsh climate, is absolutely essential and indispensable to the safety of the Alps.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it absolutely essential for the reproductive material to come from the very area where the climatic conditions apply genuinely, and for the reproductive material to be appropriate to the climatic conditions. Member States must therefore have the facility to stipulate the selection criteria for reproductive material in a non-bureaucratic manner, because nothing will be more devastating than when it is too late to prevent damage to the forest land as a whole. I should like to point out that it is not only the Alps but, above all, the Nordic areas, the polar areas and also the southern areas which have special requirements in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Redondo Jiménez (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, we welcome this proposal for a directive for several reasons, one of which is the extension of its scope. It now encompasses not only wood production but also other forest objectives such as cork and the protection of genetic resources. We should also congratulate ourselves because it now identifies different categories and encourages the protection given by reforestation and not just wood production. It allows maximum variability from the genetic viewpoint, thereby guaranteeing adaptation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the main the proposal responds to the differing needs of the Member States and includes the principle of subsidiarity. The accession of the Nordic and Mediterranean countries to the European Union is the main reason for updating the current directive which regulates the marketing of forest plants and seeds and which has not been substantially amended since 1975.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of the directive coincides on the basic aspects of objective, number of categories, definitions of basic materials and so on with the world’s other main system of marketing forest reproductive material, namely the OECD. Work has been carried out in recent years to update this system and an improved text is now pending approval by the Council. Coherence between these texts can only assist the marketing of these materials.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also congratulate Mr Pesälä on his report. I agree that the date set for the entry into force of the directive cannot be 1 January 2000 but must be postponed by at least three years to give the Member States time to comply with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments by other Members, such as those tabled by Mrs Schierhuber, must also be welcomed. They include an amendment on the strengthening of the control of trade flows by an official certificate of origin. However, there is one very important point which we must consider. The explanatory statement specified that the external quality of materials was guaranteed, yet point (d) of Annex VII deals with this in a very general manner.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a trivial issue. Plant quality is essential in the Mediterranean environment where reforestation is carried out under very difficult conditions. Experience has taught us that plants of certain sizes cannot survive in a particular environment. This is true in many areas of southern Europe where the drought conditions are extreme. In order to assist their establishment, this means using container-grown plants with good root systems, whereas in other countries plants without any roots can successfully grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The external quality of plants has a big impact, not only on the percentage which survive, which can range from 20% to 85%, but also on their future development in the extremely harsh conditions of their transfer to this climate. External quality is one of the factors which determines the quality of the woodland of the future. A lack of regulation of the external quality of plants may therefore cause very serious problems as this will allow all sizes of plant to be placed on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">You should bear in mind that some Member States already have laws on this subject. It is in the interests of the whole European environment to ensure that plantations are correctly established so that a large proportion do not fail. The plants must be suitable and adaptable because, unfortunately, in many corners of the European Union, you cannot plant what you want, only what is practical.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that adequate consideration is given to this unresolved problem in the text of the proposal, the Council is trying to reach agreement on the incorporation of a new point 7. This will contain the external characteristics which must be satisfied, for their marketing in the Mediterranean areas of the Community, by the forest species best adapted to the difficult soil and climate conditions of these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud and encourage this solution to which I hope the European Commission will agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is reasonable that this directive needs to be updated as a result of the accession of new Member States and the development of the single market and forest research. It is reasonable that EU labelling should be harmonised in order to facilitate trade within the EU and with the OECD. But the directive takes no account of the differing needs of the Member States. In the view of our specialists in Germany, in the view of the German forestry industry and the forest nursery industry, this new directive will have a lasting negative impact. Monitoring should be confined to forest undertakings and should not, as the report provides, apply to all undertakings, as these requirements would then affect undertakings which produce no forest reproductive material at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The willingness of successive farmers to plant forests in my region is receding sharply. This increasing prevalent basic attitude is dictated by financial considerations. I would just like to say to the House that I know what I am talking about because the forest economy has longed played an important role in our own undertaking and I would like in this context to point out the life-threatening situation in the Germany forest nurseries. Given the change in forestry in my country towards natural regeneration, massive cutbacks in planting requirements and a lack of public funds, I feel that I really must draw the House’s attention to this. The monitoring system is now supposed to be up and running by 2003. Our experts tell me that they think this deadline is too short. The directive is unacceptable in this respect; it fails to take account of geographical and regional differences within the EU. In northern countries we have to cope with huge forest areas with a single registration number, so that the new regulation holds no problem whatsoever in store for these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to more or less keep to my allotted time, but we should bear in mind during the overall debate that we must not only take account of the Nordic point of view and we must not only consider the enthusiasm of mountain lovers in Austria; we in the middle of the EU, and this includes Germany, set great store by open clauses, so that the whole system can remain truly practicable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and of course its rapporteur, Mr Pesälä, for the very positive approach adopted towards the Commission proposal; and the Commission appreciates the broad acceptance of its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal aims to update the current legislation on the marketing of forest reproductive material to take account of the accession of new Member States since 1975, the internal market and scientific advances. Twenty-two amendments have been proposed. I can accept the large majority of them as they stand or with minor modification in respect of their drafting or presentation. The Commission can accept the Amendment No 23 proposed now by Mr Pesälä. I would like to comment on the four amendments which the Commission cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I will comment on Amendment No 4. According to the proposed amendment, an explicit reference to the principle of subsidiarity should be inserted within the recitals. The Commission is not in favour. The proposal is based on Article 37 of the Treaty, and therefore falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. However, the Commission proposal has fully recognised the specificity of the conditions of certain Member States or certain parts thereof and the text explicitly reflects this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to Amendment No 7. The Commission provides in the first part of Article 5(2)b that the procedures ensuring the environmental risk assessment and other relevant elements should be equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 90/220. They will be introduced in a future regulation. According to the proposed amendment, the generic expression of the relevant elements should be replaced with a positive list of elements. The Commission feels that this is inappropriate taking into account that any exhaustive list would limit unnecessarily the scope of the provision. Insofar as the second part of the amendment is concerned, I can agree to the addition of a reference to the European Parliament in the future regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10: according to the proposed amendment, an official certificate of origin should accompany each consignment of forest reproductive material during marketing. The Commission agrees with the aim to ensure that trade flow should be controlled but the introduction of such a certificate would represent an unnecessary burden for trade. According to the Commission, it would be preferable to introduce appropriate amendments in respect of the existing master certificate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally Amendment No 17: according to the proposed amendment, Member States shall specify the requirements their reproductive material should meet in order to be considered well adapted to particular climatic conditions or exposed upland situations. The Commission is in favour of justified derogations when they are well defined in respect of their content, for example, for a Community region with specific climatic conditions and in respect of the procedures to be followed. The Commission feels that the proposed amendment is too broadly based and introduces the possibility for Member States to unilaterally prohibit the marketing of forest reproductive material.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are my comments, and I would like to thank you for your attention and thank once again the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
