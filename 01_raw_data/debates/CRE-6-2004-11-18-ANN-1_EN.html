<p>(EN) I would like to reiterate the major elements of the answers given by Council to similar questions put in the past, notably to Question 743/03, in December 2003:</p>
<p>"As a general comment, the Council would like to emphasise that it deplores any situation where human rights and respect of persons are not sufficiently guaranteed. As already stated in its answer to questions H-544 to 549/03, the Council is informed of the trial and imprisonment of five Cuban citizens resident in Florida, since 2001, and of the concerns expressed by HR NGOs about their imprisonment conditions. However, the Council is not competent to discuss the conditions of the trial.</p>
<p>The treatment of Cuban prisoners and their families is a bilateral issue between the USA and Cuba, since the protection of the rights and interests of States' nationals abroad is, pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the individual responsibility of the State concerned. Moreover, the Geneva Conventions are laws governing only the treatment of persons captured during armed conflict, not of civilians, such as these two persons, who are being held pursuant to alleged breaches of criminal law.</p>
<p>As concerns the more general issue of respect for human rights, the Council underlines that it takes advantage of any meeting at whatever level with third countries to focus on the need for it to be ensured and promoted. In particular, the Council would like to stress that in its conclusions after its meeting in Brussels on 12 December last, the European Council released a declaration on transatlantic relations in which it insists on the necessity for the EU and its transatlantic partners to defend a common agenda based in particular on the promotion of the rule of law, democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>In the present case, nevertheless, the Council informs the Honorable Parliamentarian that the "Miami Five" case has not been discussed with the United States, being a bilateral problem between the USA and Cuba."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0396"></a>

<p>The situation in Palestine remains unstable and disturbing. Despite the demonstrations and international protests, the same things continue: the building of settlements on the West Bank; the military occupation; the destruction of infrastructures (some of them built with EU funds), agriculture, housing and other assets; 'selective' assassinations, in reality not limited to their targets; constant violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people by means of full-blooded state terrorism; the building of a quite unacceptable wall, which the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories has said must by now be condemned as an illegal act of annexation; and defiant and aggressive gestures against UN and Red Cross personnel who do not condone Israel's terrorist practices.

<p>(EN) At its meeting of 25-26 March, the European Council noted - what were then - the proposals for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the northern West Bank to which the honourable Member of Parliament referred to in his question.

<p>it took place in the context of the Roadmap;</p>
<p>it was a step towards a two State solution;</p>
<p>it did not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank;</p>

<p>The European Council of 4 -5 November 2004 welcomed the Knesset vote on 26 October to support an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip and part of the northern West Bank and expressed its willingness to support such a withdrawal as a first step in the overall process, in accordance with the conditions as laid out above, amongst which, that it takes place in the context of the Roadmap.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0399"></a>

This is mainly because of financial considerations (42% cite the resultant reduction in income) and because men fear that it may damage their careers (31%). This issue has a very important part to play in increasing both the birth rate and the employment of women, and is directly linked with the Lisbon objectives.</p>

<p>(EN) Research into the non-food use of agricultural products has been a priority for the EU Research and Technological Development Framework Programmes (FP) for many years now.</p>
<p>Under FP5 (1998-2002) the main efforts dealing with the non-food use of agricultural products were funded through the “Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources Programme” and the “Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Programme”. The main areas of research included the development of improved and sustainable crops, the manufacturing of bioproducts i.e. chemicals, bioplastics, cosmetics, drugs, polymers as well as the energy production (heat, electricity and biofuels for transport) from crops. Many projects are still ongoing and their results will be available within the next two years.</p>
<p>Under the current Framework Programme (2002-2006) funding is focused on non-food uses of agricultural products for energy (Sustainable Energy Systems). The research areas include energy production from biomass (heat, electricity, hydrogen), biofuels (fuels from biomass) for the transport sector as well as biomass use for the integrated production of energy and bioproducts (so called biorefineries). These research areas are in line with the Common Agricultural Policy which provides assistance for crops for energy production as well as with our energy policies concerning sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply for the Union.</p>
<p>The total budget for the Sustainable Energy Systems is € 890 million. From this budget, about 100 M€ will be allocated to biomass. It should be noted that, in addition to the agricultural products and residues, biomass includes forest and biowastes. Therefore, not all this budget is directly linked to the use of agricultural products.</p>

<p>The Portuguese newspaper 'Diário Económico', in an article of 12 October 2004 entitled 'Almunia threatens to block funding for cohesion states - Brussels admits it only punishes poorer Member States which breach the Stability Pact', reports Commissioner Almunia as stating: 'For both new and old EU Member States which are in receipt of Cohesion Fund monies, we have a powerful weapon which is not in the Pact.

<p>(EN) The possibility to suspend the financing of new cohesion fund projects if a Member State has not implemented its stability or convergence programme in such a way as to avoid an excessive government deficit is foreseen by article 6 of the Council Regulation (1264/99) on the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>Macro-economic conditionality is one of the basic principles of the Cohesion Fund laid down in 1994. Additional Community assistance through the creation of the Cohesion Fund was to be provided to less developed countries which fulfilled the conditions for a sound budgetary situation as set out in article 104 of the Treaty, in line with the Protocol on economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p>However, the suspension of the Cohesion Fund assistance is not automatic.</p>
<p>First, though the excessive deficit procedure and conditionality are related, they are two separate procedures with different legal bases. Suspension needs a specific decision from the Council acting upon a specific recommendation from the Commission.</p>
<p>Second, conditionality would not be used as a sanction for past deficits which governments have no possibility to correct but rather as an incentive for the Member States concerned to take corrective action in the future. Thus, suspension would not be recommended at the stage where the existence of an excessive deficit is decided by the Council in accordance with article 104.6 of the Treaty and a recommendation is addressed to the Member State concerned for its correction. Suspension could be implemented if Member States persist in failing to put into practice the recommendation of the Council and do not take the measures for deficit reduction that are judged necessary by the Council. In other words, Member States will be granted the opportunity to take action before being sanctioned. If suspension is implemented, it will cease when effective action has been taken.</p>
<p>Such an approach allows the conditionality provision specific to the Cohesion Fund to be implemented in a manner consistent with the objective of sound public finances and the principle of equal treatment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0377"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has not adopted yet any proposal on the reform of the Regional Aid Guidelines but is currently reviewing them for the assessments of compatibility of regional State aid for the term after 2006.</p>
<p>The aim is to redefine regional aid policy in an enlarged Union, reconciling the overall reduction of State aid volumes with the Community objective of economic and social cohesion. The reform is inspired by the conclusions of the European Councils of Lisbon and Stockholm, calling upon the Commission to give clear priority to the least developed regions in conformity with the exceptional nature of regional State aid. The underlying economic principle of the reform is that the best way to address regional disparities and increase regional growth rates is by creating the right incentives to economic operators by fostering higher productivity and competitiveness rather than subsidising inefficient firms or causing serious distortions in the internal market.</p>
<p>Accordingly with the spirit of the reform of the Cohesion policy, the rationale is also to shift from geographical to thematic concentration, outside the lagging regions.</p>
<p>In this context, Directorate General Competition has elaborated a working document and transmitted it to all Member States. This document is not binding on the Commission and the remarks from the Member States are being analysed and will be taken into consideration.

<p>The Commission's decision declaring illegal the aid received by the IZAR shipyards has raised the spectre of possible job losses and a massive public response in the Ferrol region of Galicia, home to the IZAR-Fene shipyards, and the Sestao region of the Basque Country, home to the La Naval shipyards. In the first of these cases, the continued ban on the construction of merchant vessels and limitation to the construction of offshore platforms to which IZAR-Fene is subject, which has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, is contradictory. Has the Spanish Government submitted a request for IZAR to be allowed to recommence construction of merchant vessels? Will the Commission negotiate a transitional phase, within the ambit of the WTO, in which shipbuilding aid could be granted that would enable European shipyards to compete with ones in Korea?</p>

<p>(EN) Migration and asylum are complex and sensitive issues. Referring to “concentration camps” in that context can only give rise to emotional reactions and generate confusion and misunderstanding without helping to find concrete solutions to real problems. There is no intention to create concentration camps whatsoever.</p>
<p>Since last year, various ideas concerning schemes for refugee centres have been presented by certain Member States in the EU context. These ideas aimed either at establishing protected zones in third countries to which those arriving in EU Member States could be directly transferred to have their asylum claims processed, or, more recently, at processing claims of those intercepted at the international waters in the Mediterranean in centres in North-Africa in order to prevent further loss of lives during their crossing of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>These suggestions have not been endorsed at EU level. Nevertheless, it is almost certain that such suggestions will continue to be presented as long as the problems which they attempt to address remain.</p>
<p>The ideas just described above should however not be confused with the recent Commission’s proposals, endorsed by the Council, aiming at enhancing refugee protection in the regions of origin by establishing EU Regional Protection Programmes.</p>
<p>The objective of such programmes, which should facilitate the Commission in assisting third countries in their efforts to better manage asylum, is to enable the countries in the region of origin to offer effective protection to persons requiring international protection as soon as possible and as closely as possible to the countries of turmoil. Co-ownership with the third countries concerned, close cooperation with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as well as respect of the relevant international legal instruments, in particular the 1951 Refugee Convention, will be the guiding principles for the implementation of these programmes.</p>
<p>Through Tacis, Cards and other thematic budget lines, the Community also provides technical and financial assistance for developing third countries institutional capacities in the areas of migration and asylum. This assistance is certainly not given in exchange of “à la carte services”. It is usually part of a broader approach towards these countries aimed at helping them to better manage migration, enhancing their national asylum systems, bringing them closer to the international standards and developing solutions to refugee problems closer to the regions of origin.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0385"></a>

<p>(EN) The terms ’recovery’ and ‘disposal’ are key notions in Community environmental legislation. They play a significant role in the application of the Waste Shipment Regulation. However, these terms also play a significant role for a number of other important pieces of environmental legislation, including the directives on packaging and batteries as well as more recent ones dealing with WEEE and end-of-life vehicles. In the Commission’s view, the place for defining these two key notions is therefore not the Waste Shipment Regulation but the main piece of general waste legislation, i.e. the Waste Framework Directive. The recovery and disposal definitions should therefore remain as before in that Directive in order to allow for a uniform application throughout the environmental legislation.</p>
<p>Even in light of the case-law referred to by the honourable Member and with all possible clarifications of the terms ‘disposal’ and ‘recovery’ it is probably impossible to avoid all risks for disagreements between national authorities on whether a shipment is intended for disposal or recovery. This is a complex issue and it is necessary to have a procedural rule to resolve disagreements. Therefore Article 30(3) in the proposed Regulation for Waste Shipments is needed to safeguard a smooth and efficient handling of waste shipments. On this basis the Commission has not found any grounds for deleting Article 30(3) from its proposal.</p>
<p>In addition the discussions between the Institutions have evolved during the first phase of co-decision on this proposal. Amendments by the Parliament and the Council have tended to introduce provisions which will further restrict shipments of waste for recovery within the EU. The Commission remains convinced that the right way forward is not to restrict such shipments but to develop common EU standards where they are needed to avoid eco-dumping of waste and to enhance waste treatment standards across the EU. This will be a central part of the upcoming Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste which will be presented in 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0388"></a>

<p>In a communication of July 2004, responding to pressure from the WTO, the Commission proposed an initial reform of the European sugar regime. The guaranteed sugar price would be cut by a third. A number of ACP countries, including Jamaica, have in turn already responded to this. According to the Sugar Protocol to the Cotonou Agreement between the EU and ACP countries, they enjoy preferential treatment in that they may export sugar to Europe at the same (supported) price which European producers receive. The WTO has already made it clear that the preferential treatment for EU imports from ACP countries will be allowed to continue provided that the sugar is intended only for use within the EU itself. However, calculations show that a cut of one third in the price would mean a loss of revenue of € 90 m to the Caribbean countries alone.

<p>Thus, the Commission proposal made clear that commitments provided for the ACP countries in the Sugar Protocol will be fully respected, including guaranteed delivery rights and guaranteed prices.</p>
<p>However, under a scenario which inevitably leads to considerable price and production cuts for European beet and sugar producers, it is obvious that guaranteed price for raw sugar from the ACP has to be also set at a corresponding level. The Commission acknowledges the importance of the sugar sector in many of the Sugar Protocol countries, and is well aware that adjustments will be necessary. The commitment of the Commission to support this process in Sugar Protocol countries is an integral part of the reform Communication itself. In a joint letter, Commissioners Lamy, Fischler and Nielson reiterated this directly to Heads of State of Sugar Protocol countries.

<p>(FR) The difficulties faced by the soft fruit sector in Poland are partly the result of the good harvest – particularly of strawberries – within the EU of 25. This increased supply has led to a decrease in the European industry’s demand for frozen soft fruit from Poland. This decrease has also affected EU imports from most third countries. With the very good harvest in Poland (181 000 tonnes of strawberries in 2004 compared to 131 000 tonnes in 2003), this low European demand has led to a dramatic decrease in the prices paid by processors to Polish producers.</p>
<p>The difficulties are also the result of the high degree of fragmentation of Polish production (there are around 200 000 strawberry producers in Poland) and their very low degree of organisation. The Common Organisation of the Market (COM) in fresh fruits and vegetables is based upon strengthening producers’ organisations so that they can market their products in conditions which are more favourable to them. By using the COM aid for the creation and development of producers’ organisations, Polish producers should be able to market their products under better conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0390"></a>

<p>(FR) Following Poland’s accession to the EU and as a result of the talks between the Commission and the Russian authorities during the first few months of this year, Russia has extended the application of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU to the ten new Member States, and hence to Poland. That agreement is based on the application of the principles of most favoured nation and national treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each of the two parties is committed to not imposing quantitative restrictions on imports originating from the other, except in the case of certain specific products in relation to which bilateral agreements have been reached (in particular steel) which allow the EU to maintain quotas on Russian exports. Finally, Russia is obliged to guarantee non-discrimination amongst the Member States.</p>
<p>In practical terms, that means that Russia can impose restrictions on Polish exports or on exports from any other Member State of the EU only within the framework of trade protection instruments or in the field of agriculture, in particular by means of tariff quotas. Restrictions can also result from the application of technical barriers to trade, health measures, phytosanitary measures, etc. which must be duly justified (Russia, however, being no longer a member of the World Trade Organisation, (WTO) applies lower standards in these fields).</p>
<p>Returning to the question put by the honourable Member, Russia has the right, like any country, to take trade protection measures (safeguards, anti-dumping or anti-subsidy). At the moment, Russia is only applying safeguard measures. By definition, they therefore affect all EU exports (and those from the rest of the world) and are not aimed specifically at exports from specific countries, such as Poland. However, if Russia were to take anti-dumping measures, those measures could affect all EU exports of a product affected, or be directed at the exports of one or several Member States (including possibly Poland).</p>
<p>In this field, Russia applies its internal legislation, which is gradually being brought into line with the relevant WTO rules. During Russian trade protection enquiries, the companies in question are able to defend their interests and the Commission assists them in this process as much as possible.</p>
<p>With regard to dairy products, following enlargement, Russia is still carrying out inspections of establishments in the new Member States wishing to export their products into Russia. According to the information available to the Commission, Russian inspections have been completed in most of the new Member States, except for Poland, because of the high number of establishments involved in that country. The Russian authorities are committed to completing the inspections as soon as possible, since they have a negative effect on trade. In the mean time, Russia has shown a degree of flexibility by authorising certain Polish establishments which have been given authorisation to export products within the EU, to export into Russia.</p>
<p>With regard to how to deal with this type of measure in the future, the EU will continue to use the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as well as the European Economic Area when it is put in place. Furthermore, we expect Russia’s accession to the WTO to have positive effects in particular on the implementation by Russia of stricter discipline in fields relating to trade.</p>
<p>With regard to the possibility of Polish exporters receiving compensation, following export restrictions, this is not provided for in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or in the Community legislation in the fields in question. There are, however, public or private national instruments, such as guarantee funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0391"></a>

<p>In October 2004, a group of countries (Spain, Greece, Portugal, Finland, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Hungary) expressed their radical opposition, within the EU Council, to the reform of the sugar sector proposed by the outgoing Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Franz Fischler. At the same time, other Member States such as France do not agree with all aspects of the Commission communication.</p>
<p>The reduction in guaranteed prices, combined with only partial compensation for this, and the cutting of production quotas and quota transfers sound a death knell for the production of sugar beet in many European areas and will cause many industrial units to close.</p>

<p>(EN) Relocation has always been a challenge for regional policy and has become an even greater concern within an enlarged Union. In an effort to rationalise production, firms are searching for areas that offer the greatest tax incentives, cheapest labour costs and highest availability of relevant skill, inside or outside the EU. Relocation is a normal phenomenon in economic life. State aid support (with or without Structural Funds) constitutes only one of the factors influencing a company’s decision. The present emphasis on relocation is caused by a convergence of two factors: company taxes are generally lower in the new Member States than in the old ones (0% in Estonia for re-invested profits and flat rates of 19% in Slovakia and 16% in Hungary) and, because of their disadvantaged position, new Member States can generally offer higher State aids.</p>
<p>With regard to the general issue of relocations and collective redundancies, the Commission recalls the fact that it has no authority to prevent or defer the specific closure or relocation of a company or a part thereof. The Community framework provides however for numerous provisions in relation to both the issue of financial support and to an adequate management of restructuring.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes for the 2007-2013 programming period for the Structural and Cohesion Funds to reinforce the provisions related to relocation of enterprises. The time span required to maintain a productive investment has been extended. To retain support from the Funds, undertakings shall maintain their productive investment for a seven-year period following the date of the decision granting the Funds' support.</p>
<p>More importantly, unlike the current period, the Commission has proposed that those firms that have to reimburse funds as a result of a change of location within a Member State or between Member States will not be entitled to receive support from the Funds in future (this provision will be subject to detailed discussion at Council level).</p>
<p>Another disincentive to relocation results already now from existing state aid rules: In fact, under the 1998 Commission Regional Aid Guidelines, firms that received regional investment aid after 1999 have to maintain the assisted activity for a minimum period of five years, or to reimburse the aid received. Of course, Member States awarding aid are free to impose even more restrictive conditions.</p>
<p>With regard to the legal framework, several Community directives lay down procedures for the information and of consultation of workers' representatives which can prove to be applicable in the event of closures of companies, in particular Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning collective redundancies<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and Council Directive 94/45/EC, of 22 September 1994, concerning the European Works Councils<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (currently under revision). Another directive was also adopted on 11 March 2002 by the Parliament and the Council with the aim of supplementing the Community mechanism on the matter (Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework relating to information and consultation of workers in the EC<a href="#defann_23_3" name="refann_23_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>). The first two directives were transposed in the national laws of the Member States (the third having to be transposed only by 23.03.2005).</p>
<p>The Commission has also sought to widen and deepen the debate on the contribution that can be made at Community level to ensuring that restructuring is managed having due regard to its social consequences. It has therefore consulted the European social partners on 'Anticipating and managing change: a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring'. The consultation paper advocated a positive approach to corporate restructuring, balancing the interests of businesses faced with changes in the conditions governing their activity and those of employees threatened with the loss of their jobs.</p>
<p>In response to the paper, the social partners submitted to the Commission in October 2003 a joint text 'Orientations for reference in managing change and its social consequences'.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the fact that the social partners have indicated their intention to pursue work on topics relevant to this theme under their work programme for the period 2003-2005. As regards the dissemination and the application of the agreed orientations, together with other instruments and actions, social dialogue at different levels will undoubtedly be asked to play a useful role in developing and applying those principles throughout the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Within the Sixth Framework Programme (FP) (2002-2006) for Research, Technological Development (RTD), activities related to the ‘large scale integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into energy supplies’ are mainly funded under the "Sustainable Energy Systems" thematic sub-priority. They are implemented through the newly designed Integrated Projects but also through other traditional instruments.</p>
<p>Some of these projects support the development of new and innovative solutions making local communities both sustainable and highly efficient. The focus at present is on optimising the energy flows through the integration of RES technologies into electricity distribution networks, district heating systems and production/distribution of biofuels. There are not yet any large-scale demonstration projects addressing the integration of the RES available in local communities into the whole hydrogen energy chain, but rather smaller scale projects on the integration of a particular renewable source (e.g. wind, solar, biomass).</p>
<p>Some €100 million of EU funding, matched by an equivalent amount of public and private investment, has already been awarded to research and demonstration projects for hydrogen and fuel cells in FP6. Additional EU funding worth approximately €150 million is expected for the last calls for proposals. More than 60% of the research and demonstration activities are likely to be implemented via Integrated Projects.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has been identified as a main candidate for an alternative fuel in a Commission Communication in 2001<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In view of the potential of hydrogen to become a major universal energy carrier in the future, the Commission has launched the European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform (HFP) in January 2004 to develop a strategy aimed at prioritising, mobilising and co-ordinating national and European programmes and private investment from the early stages of development to the deployment of first markets. This Platform, which brings together the relevant European private and public stakeholders, is developing a common Strategic Research Agenda and a Deployment Strategy for hydrogen and fuel cells at European level. The need of large-scale demonstrations integrating RES and hydrogen technologies aiming at building up ‘Pilot Hydrogen Communities’ might be one of the important elements of this strategy, and Islands could be one of the types of hydrogen community to be investigated.</p>
<p>It is expected that these Strategic Research Agenda and Deployment Strategy will have an impact on future EU initiatives, particularly the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). In a Communication adopted in 2004<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> that outlines the guidelines for future EU policy to support research, the Commission proposes the next Framework Programme to be implemented not only by means of the existing Community instruments (e.g. “Integrated Projects”) but, in some areas, through large-scale Pan-European “Joint Technology Initiatives” (JTI). Following the developments under the Technology Platform, hydrogen might be one of these Technology Initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that no internal censorship is carried out in relation to journalists’ questions at daily press conferences and special conferences.</p>
<p>The Europe by Satellite service (EBS) never in principle interrupts the transmission of a public event, except in two exceptional circumstances:</p>
<p>When another event of greater political or media interest, which coincides with the daily press conference, must be covered live (for example, a Parliament or Council press conference). In this event, the part of the press conference which has been interrupted is retransmitted on EBS as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When the day is full of events whose coverage is of high priority, for example, during weeks of hearings for Commissioners-designate in the EP. In this case, a recording of the daily press conference will be broadcast as soon as possible, depending on the schedule.</p>
<p>In all cases, EBS tries to make the contents of the daily press conference available by other means, in particular providing on-line (on the Europa EBS site) audio and/video recordings (depending on the circumstances) in the form of professional-quality computer files. These files are provided on-line independently of satellite transmissions, they are announced on the EBS schedule and may be consulted, downloaded, archived and broadcast by all users.</p>
<p>These exceptions to the principle relating to interruptions of the live EBS service are subject to prior discussions and decisions within the Interinstitutional Editorial Committee of the EBS, which includes officials from all the Union’s institutions.

<p>(EN) EQUAL is a Community Initiative which serves as a laboratory for inclusive ways of delivering European labour market policies and actions. In this way, it makes an important contribution to ongoing labour market reform. Jointly financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) and national governments, it provides an experimental platform for all stakeholders in employment policies to explore, develop, test and share good practice. With respect to tackling discrimination in employment and training, it aims to identify what works and what does not work, and why.</p>
<p>This Initiative, which has a total funding of about € 3 billion over the six years of its duration, has been constructed in two phases, each of which begins with a Call for Proposals in the Member States. The Development Partnerships, which are selected following these calls for proposals, form and consolidate their partnerships, enter into transnational agreements with other Development Partnerships, and implement the activities which they have been chosen to carry out. As they do so, they make every effort to ensure that the lessons learnt are mainstreamed at local and national levels, for which there are a range of mechanisms.</p>
<p>Equal is about learning. In order to extract the good practices from EQUAL and mainstream them effectively, the Commission and the Member States, from the outset of the programme, set up and are implementing an ongoing assessment of outcomes and results at all three levels of action:</p>
<p>On the ground: All Development Partnerships carry out an ongoing assessment of their activities and results, to ensure verifiable evidence of their good practice. These assessments have been used to generate a basis for benchmarking, and for adjusting the work plans of the Development Partnerships where necessary.</p>
<p>At national level: All Member States carry out an ongoing evaluation at national level. They all presented a Mid-Term Review in 2003, which will be updated again before the end of 2005. The Mid-Term Reviews confirmed the usefulness of the experimental approach to finding new ways of tackling discrimination, highlighted the advantages of applying the EQUAL principles, and identified promising fields of good practice. These mid-term reviews also served as a basis for modifying the priorities and implementation mechanisms of the national EQUAL Programmes.</p>
<p>At Union level, the Commission has charged a team of independent experts with an evaluation study, to assess the working of the EQUAL principles and the implications of EQUAL for the European Employment Strategy, the Social Inclusion Process, and other Community policies and programmes. Their Mid-Term Evaluation, which is publicly available, is based on the results of the national evaluation reports, and on analysis and field work of the EU-wide evaluators.</p>
<p>The evaluators did not suggest any changes in the overall architecture for EQUAL. However, a number of issues that may limit the effectiveness of EQUAL were highlighted, and a set of recommendations to enhance effectiveness were made.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the second round which was launched at the beginning of 2004, the Commission took up all recommendations of the Mid-Term Evaluation and translated them, in the Commission’s Guidelines for the second round of EQUAL (COM (2003(840)), into new guidance and recommendations for the Member States.</p>
<p>The EQUAL Initiative runs until 2006 (the programme may be executed until 2008). Funding of the Development Partnerships in the second round starts effectively in 2005. This allows all 10 new Member States, for which a total ESF contribution of more than € 250 million has been allocated, to join the second round of EQUAL in a synchronised way and on equal terms.</p>
<p>The evaluations at national and EU level proved that the key principles of EQUAL, i.e. partnership and empowerment, transnational co-operation, innovation and mainstreaming, have worked successfully and can provide a sound basis for contributing to the ongoing reforms of labour market policies and delivery systems, based on learning from one another. The Commission has therefore decided to "mainstream" the EQUAL principles in the context of the new ESF Regulation for 2007 to 2013, above all those of "partnership" and "innovation" by including them as an integral part in all national ESF Programmes. In order to enhance "transnational cooperation" the scope of which is widened, the proposal provides for an increased level of co-financing (10% higher).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0403"></a>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The principal characteristic of most of Greece’s island regions in recent years has been unemployment and a reluctance to invest in these areas. One of the main reasons for this situation is the increased cost of transporting goods to the islands and also the increased cost - because of transport - of the products which are produced in these regions and sent to mainland Greece.</p>
<p>In response to this problem, the Greek government has instituted a 30% reduction in VAT on fuel intended for the most remote islands of the Eastern Aegean. However, the cost of fuel, even before the oil crisis, was particularly high in comparison with the mainland.</p>
<p>In view of this situation, particularly following the international increase in oil prices, does the Commission intend to take specific measures to support economic life in these regions, in line with the spirit of Article 158 of the Treaty? Moreover, what specific measures can it propose so that the inhabitants of island regions are not overburdened with the cost of increased expenditure on transport?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>(FR) 1. Fiscal differentiation to compensate for the cost of transport in remote islands.</p>
<p>1.1 Contextual factors</p>
<p>Firstly, the significance of the rise in oil prices should be seen in relative terms. In fact, the average price over the last four years has remained relatively stable, at around USD 28 per barrel, and the price of a barrel of oil, expressed in constant prices, is lower than it was thirty years ago following spectacular rises in price.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the rise in the price of crude oil, which has been very considerable since the beginning of 2004, has led several Member States to consider taking their own corrective measures to compensate for the damaging effects of this development, in terms of both economic growth and the solvency of consumers.</p>
<p>1.2 Application of reduced VAT rates in the territory of the outlying Greek islands</p>
<p>In view of this, Greece’s solution to the problem must be reconsidered. The initiative taken by the Greek authorities to reduce VAT on fuels by 30%, with a view to facilitating transport to and from the remote islands, conforms to the provisions of the sixth modified Council Directive of 17 May 1977 on VAT, which authorises Greece to ‘apply VAT rates up to 30% lower than the rates applied in mainland Greece’ for several regions and certain islands in the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>This is clearly a derogation from Community law, since there is a general principle in the field of VAT which consists in applying – unless there are derogations – the same taxes in a uniform fashion throughout the national territory. An exception to this principle of uniformity was introduced by means of Article 28(2f) of the above-mentioned directive.</p>
<p>1.3 Excise duties affecting the consumption of fuels used in air transport</p>
<p>Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity, allows for the Member States to exempt the use of ‘fuels for air transport, other than private tourism’. In practice, an exemption of this nature favours access to the Greek remote islands, which also responds to the concern of the Greek authorities which has led them to benefit from a reduced rate of VAT on fuels, as has just been pointed out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 14(2) of the directive allows for the scope for exemption from excise to be reserved for international and intra-Community air transport, which by design implicitly allows the Member States the possibility of taxing the consumption of fuels intended for domestic flights.</p>
<p>2. The system of aid to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by islands</p>
<p>Three aid mechanisms allow the Member States to support financially the development or maintenance of sea and air transport services, in particular destined for or within island regions. These are the awarding of public service contracts, the existence of social aid and finally regional operating aid granted to the least-favoured regions. These three mechanisms are implemented on the initiative of the Member State, under the supervision of the European Commission, and for the latter two categories, following a formal decision by the Commission.</p>
<p>2.1 Public service contracts</p>
<p>Council Regulation No 2408/92/EEC of 23 July 1992, on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes, and Regulation No 3577/92/EEC of 7 December 1992 on maritime cabotage, allow Member States to impose, if they consider it necessary, public service obligations on air carriers, including, amongst other things, tariff obligations, in the case of outlying regions or development within their territory, or regional low-traffic routes. As regards maritime transport, public service obligations may be imposed on shipping companies participating in services to and between islands.</p>
<p>If no air carrier is in a position to perform these obligations on a commercial basis, the Member State in question may award a public service contract guaranteeing exclusive operation of the route for three years to an air carrier selected by means of a European invitation to tender, and may provide it with financial compensation defined by contract for the operation of that route. In the maritime sector, similar contracts may be employed for a period which should normally not exceed six years.</p>
<p>2.2 Social aid</p>
<p>In accordance with the exemption laid down in Article 87 (2a) of the EC Treaty, and in accordance with the guidelines on air transport, a Member State may grant aid for the end consumer of the service, provided that it is granted without discrimination in terms of the origin of that service, that is to say, in this case any carrier involved.</p>
<p>In practice, the social aid only benefits certain categories of passengers, but it may also involve the whole of the population of the region in question. It must therefore be expressly authorised by the European Commission, following notification by the Member State.</p>
<p>2.3 The granting of regional operating aid for the least-favoured regions</p>
<p>This type of regional aid may be granted pursuant to Article 87(3a) of the EC Treaty, and is intended to compensate for certain handicaps suffered by the least-favoured regions.</p>
<p>It is considered compatible with Community law provided that the aid granted is degressive and for a limited time period, in accordance with point 4.15 of the Guidelines on State aid for regional purposes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0405"></a>

<p>According to recent data from Eurobarometer, the majority of male employees in Europe (75%) are aware of their right to parental leave, but 84% of them do not take advantage of it. This is mainly because of financial considerations (42% cite the resultant reduction in income) and because men fear that it may damage their careers (31%).

<p>(EN) Council Directive 96/34/EC of 3 June 1996 on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC provides a right to parental leave for all male and female workers in the European Union.</p>
<p>The recently published Eurobarometer survey reveals that 75% of current or prospective fathers are aware that they have a right to parental leave. However, as the honourable Member has indicated, 84% of those said they had not taken parental leave or were not intending to do so.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that this survey provides useful information, not only on the numbers of men taking up parental leave, but also the reasons why many have not done so. The main factors deterring fathers from staying at home to look after a new baby or a small child are financial, lack of information and concerns about their careers. However the survey, which included an analysis on a country by country basis, showed wide variations between Member States reflecting cultural differences and attitudes.</p>
<p>More information in relation to the take up of parental leave will be collected in the ad hoc module linked to the European Labour Force Survey 2005. The results of this module will be available in March 2006.</p>
<p>In June 2003 the Commission published a report on the implementation of Directive 96/34/EC. This report shows that there is an individual right to a minimum period of 3 months parental leave for men and women to take care of their young children in all of the then EU 15. However, the report also shows that the discretion left to Member States to determine matters such as conditions of access to leave, whether leave should be taken full-time or part-time, notice periods, etc has led to considerable variations between Member States' parental leave systems. It is also important to highlight that as the provisions of the Directive are minimum standards some Member States have made more generous provision for parental leave for example in relation to the length of leave.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is making use of a number of instruments to identify and promote best practice in relation to employment and age discrimination: peer reviews; country examinations; dissemination seminars and National action plans (NAPs) assessment – employment and inclusion.</p>
<p>As regards funding instruments, the proposed new regulation on the European Social Fund (ESF) aims to strengthen the link to the European Employment Strategy. Thus, the ESF will increase its contribution to active ageing by promoting the employment of older workers and increasing the employment rate of older workers. Moreover, the ESF should also support technical assistance, with a particular focus on encouraging mutual learning through exchanges of experiences dissemination and transfer of good practices in relation to employment and social inclusion, including active ageing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An ecological disaster is developing in Lake Koronia, which has a 52-kilometre shoreline, although the lake has protected status under the Ramsar Convention and 'Natura 2000'. A month ago, thousands of birds died at the lake, and recently thousands of dead fish were found floating on the surface of the water. A microscopic examination of the water showed that it contained an extremely high level of phytoplankton, and the death of the fish is attributed to this. Experts point out that sewage from the public sewerage system is discharged into the lake untreated, which is probably responsible for this ecological disaster.</p>
<p>Will the Commission immediately investigate the causes of this environmental disaster? Will it take measures to save Lake Koronia and restore the natural environment in the region?

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the deterioration of the ecosystem of Lake Koronia due to the intensive agricultural activities, the irrational use of water resources and the pollution caused by the discharges of dangerous substances and urban waste water.</p>
<p>The Commission has initiated an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the Treaty, on the basis that Greece had failed to fulfil its obligations under Directives 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the conservation of wild birds, 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora and 76/464/EEC<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment. In December 2003, the Commission decided to issue a reasoned opinion.</p>
<p>Greece has replied to those allegations by sending information on the measures taken to protect the Lake Koronia. The reply of the Greek authorities is currently assessed by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission is taking all measures in its power to ensure that Greece complies with the requirements of EC legislation, and, if required, it will not hesitate to further pursue the infringement procedure.</p>
<p>In any case, it should be stressed that, under the Cohesion Funds regulation, the selection of projects to be co-funded is the responsibility of the Greek authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The question of the honourable Member refers to the problem of exposure of the general population to electro-magnetic fields. This is a matter dealt with in a Council Recommendation of 12<span class="sup">th</span> July 1999 limiting the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>This Recommendation sets a framework of basic restrictions and reference levels, with a view to providing for a high level of health protection for the public.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure, if these basic restrictions and reference levels are exceeded, to carry out an assessment of the situation and take the appropriate follow-up measures, such as informing those who are exposed or changing the location of the installation, the design or the way in which it is operated.</p>
<p>The Commission keeps this Recommendation under constant review. Considerable research work has been undertaken to investigate more deeply the possible long-term effects of electromagnetic fields on health. The International Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) Project conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO) is one of the major current studies and the Commission is following this project closely.</p>
<p>The residential proximity to electrical power-line installations and risks of childhood leukaemia or any other cancer remains a concern for the Commission and it will react, if necessary, to any new scientific evidence not yet taken into consideration in the present Council Recommendation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
