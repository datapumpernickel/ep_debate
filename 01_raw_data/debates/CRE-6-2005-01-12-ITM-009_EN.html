Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of the EU Member States do not expect us to talk in soundbites, but to be honest. The simple truth about the political context of this disaster should finally be told.</p>
<p class="contents">Local political interests are being played out in the shadow of the terrible tsunami tragedy. The UN’s crumbling authority is to be revived thanks to its aid measures in Asia. The USA and certain European countries wish to improve their image in this part of Asia and extend their influence over the continent by means of humanitarian measures. The victims of the disaster are being helped to some extent along the way, but it is abundantly clear that huge advantages are being gained from the whole affair.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to believe that the European Union’s charitable measures will serve aid-related purposes alone, and that we will not, as the EU, prey on human misfortune and promote our own narrow interests in the aftermath of such a major tragedy. The aid we provide should be rapid and based on solidarity, and it should not be held up by a bureaucratic obstacle course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I will now concentrate on making a few rather sobering comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The donations made by people in the European Union and throughout the world are a truly overpowering demonstration of goodwill. The evidence of how the whole of the globalised world has been touched by this terrible event also makes a deep impression.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, though, we have a proverb to the effect that ‘good intentions do not always do any good’. We need to learn how to help. The banner headline on today’s issue of one of the major German newspapers is ‘Many disorganised aid workers make Indonesia’s work difficult’. It also has to be said that the way in which the European Union has gone about things there is hardly likely to call forth rapturous enthusiasm about the success of the work it does. Let me also quote this: ‘If it were not for the American and Australian armies, who are all over the place, flying their cargo planes back and forth on a regular basis, then things would be far worse still.’ There is a problem here. It is quite obvious that what we need is not just goodwill and the willingness to come up with plenty of money; we also need an organisation that can get this money, in a proper way, to the people who need it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me therefore endorse what has already been said this morning: above all else, the European Union needs a crisis management unit, in other words, something with transport capacity, leadership and communications resources, and units to provide sanitation and supplies; that is what is needed if we want to help in a really practical way and very quickly. Until such time as the European Union has an army of its own that can deal with that sort of thing, we do in fact also need – however much goodwill is there – practical ways of delivering help, and a crisis management unit would be the very thing. That is what the EU must concentrate on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very embarrassed that they are behaving in this way and interrupting when we are having a very serious debate about such tragic matters.</p>
<p class="contents">If we may continue – 26 December 2004 was not the same last year, nor will it ever be again. Disbelief turned into incomprehension, to grief, to sympathy; a plethora of emotions as we watched the tsunami tragedy unfold. The waves and quakes were a pervasive example of how our fates are shared with one another in a global theatre of environmental and natural risk.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the South Asia Delegation, I would like to give my sincere condolences to all those affected by this tragedy. I have been very moved by the heartfelt global response to this unprecedented disaster. In the face of the tsunami, European citizens have been amongst the most generous.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, I travelled to Chennai in South India to see at first hand the relief work by the European Commission and met with officials from UNDP, Unicef and NGOs. The EU's immediate response within 24 hours was highly commendable, as was the selfless Indian decision to ask that this aid should go to the worst affected areas, such as Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Therefore, I hope that the rumours of current funding to India being diverted to other areas are not true. Having seen the needs in India for myself, I hope they will not be ignored in the short term. I would demand that the Commission does not redeploy or reprogramme funds from any existing aid projects within this region. It would be criminal to take from the world's poorest to fund this tragedy. I welcome the Commission's promise of an extra EUR 350 million, but I was not convinced by President Barroso's explanation this morning, because for years humanitarian aid budgets for Asia have been in decline, from 70% in 1990 to 38% in 2000. Therefore, it is not acceptable that we divert money away from poverty eradication programmes; we should be adding more money.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to approach this tragedy differently from any other and explore the use of new specialist teams in those countries. It is not just money that is needed: we also need to give technical expertise. I would ask the Commission to look at enduring changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is, however, one aspect of the South-East Asian situation about which I feel there is considerable reticence on the part of all politicians, at least in their public speeches. I refer to the political troubles in many of these countries: from Sri Lanka to southern Thailand or Indonesia, particularly in the area of Banda Aceh. It is a question of intervening in areas where armed independence movements have been present and active for a long time. These are areas of very violent guerrilla warfare, where there is also infiltration by Islamic groups linked to Al Qaida or the Al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Such elements make the whole reconstruction effort highly problematic, yet I have heard very little said about them, especially in public speeches. I am convinced that real, effective reconstruction is impossible without resolving the political problems: genuine political reconstruction needs to be set in motion throughout the region, to renew the currently stalled peace processes and also to strengthen the institutions and the rule of law, without which the forces of instability are likely to come to a head. This is a great opportunity. If it is well used, the whole reconstruction programme can provide the leverage needed to restart the peace processes, but if not – if intervention is badly managed – it may make the already obvious tensions explode.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I believe the European Union should address the problem of its political presence during the reconstruction process, because at the moment it is not visible and it will be even less visible later. For instance, I find it disconcerting that the first meeting between the government in Jakarta and guerrillas of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) took place in the presence of the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Japan, Singapore and Libya, while the European Union was clearly absent from the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">These are matters which, if ignored, will prevent you from properly managing the reconstruction process, which will be long and difficult but also potentially very worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to comment on four points: the first and most important at the present moment is to ensure that promises are kept and will not remain dead letter as on other occasions; in other words, that aid will reach the citizens who need it quickly and efficiently, without being squandered or stolen by corrupt intermediate links. The role of the UN is crucial here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament needs to ask creditor countries to write off the debts of the countries hit and not simply defer payment of a number of instalments. The announcement by the seven richest nations that they were simply deferring payment for the benefit of the countries hit would appear to be hypocritical in the light of the United States' insistence that the debt of Iraq, a country over which it exercises military control, be written off.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I propose that the European Parliament support the proposal formulated at the United Nations back in September 2004, and already supported by about 100 countries, on a global tax on capital transactions, arms sales and the consumption of non-renewable energy, in order to finance emergencies from natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to strengthen the European civil protection programme more generously with resources and mechanisms. The relevant report, which I presented a month ago and which was approved by the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority, needs to be strengthened more generously over coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may have been true that all the EU officials were on holiday, but not a sign of an official from the European Union was seen for days and days in those countries, for instance in Thailand. Their absence allowed people to be buried in mass graves, making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify the bodies of the missing Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">You are not giving any information on this, but I should like to know how many people were sent where and after how long a delay, because, I repeat, in many of those countries there is no record of their presence. Not a sign of a European official had been seen by the end of the year.</p>

The world was shocked by the fate of human beings, the suffering of survivors and the plight of orphans. In Europe we are mourning thousands of our own citizens, but with admiration for and gratitude to the local people who, despite their own loss and pain, found the courage and compassion to care for bewildered and frightened foreign tourists.</p>
<p class="contents">The earth moved and the public were moved. The first to act were not governments, but people. People across the world opened their hearts and opened their purses, shaming governments into matching the monies their peoples had given. Now we demand real, lasting and effective action. Humanitarian and reconstruction aid must be given and used with transparency and accountability, and debt systems reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our actions must help to bring peace, support good governance and human rights, involve local people and overcome poverty. Promises must be kept and we must develop the early warning systems which, as we now know, are already available in the form of the underground testing systems based in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, Europe must now respond to the new public mood which demands that the divisions of our world must be healed through a determined combating of poverty and disease and the removal of barriers that have stopped poorer countries trading in our markets.

<p class="contents">The suggestions of the Socialist Group appear in the joint resolution, which we will vote for with conviction and which can be summed up in seven points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the positive assessment of the appropriate actions of the Council and the Commission, which reacted immediately to the disaster and committed the necessary resources and informed Parliament – although it is noted that there has been a lack of information and communication with society, which may have led some Members to conclude that there has been nobody on the ground, when in fact there has been admirable action.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the resources promised by everybody must be produced immediately and, in any event, according to a set timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, all of the European Union’s resources must be fresh money, and in no event must they be taken from other programmes; President Barroso’s arguments have not been convincing in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the commitment to follow emergency actions with the essential reconstruction actions, in agreement with the main protagonists; the countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the commitment to implement an early warning system capable of preventing similar disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, the commitment also to implement a reaction mechanism for disasters of a permanent and professional nature, able to intervene in the event that prevention does not succeed. And there is an important point of reference in the Constitution in the form of the creation of a corps of humanitarian aid volunteers.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, these actions must not all be the result of impromptu actions, of coalitions made up of arbitrary groups of countries, but they must be the result of mobilisation within the framework of the United Nations, and with the active and visible participation of the European Union.</p>

I therefore believe we have a responsibility, which at the same time is an opportunity. I am talking about dealing seriously with the issue of the debts of the countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in some cases, this debt was taken on by corrupt and dictatorial governments, such as the Indonesia of Suharto, which were given money in an unscrupulous manner, leading to what to today is known as the debt of hate. Certain donors, therefore, have a responsibility that should firstly be investigated and then met.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a twin opportunity here: while, on the one hand, it is extremely urgent that we cancel that debt immediately – not as an act of compassion, but as recognition of the fact that the people who have already suffered as a result of irresponsible regimes should not have to suffer all over again by having to pay off their debts – on other hand, international aid must be based fundamentally on donations and not on new loans which increase the burden of that debt even further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Environmental researchers maintain that the disaster could have been avoided, if not completely then in part – with far fewer casualties and material damage – if the coral reefs and mangrove forests had been left in place. If human safety, instead of military security, had been the main priority, we should probably not have been forced to see so much death and destruction as we have now. If governments had carried out some sort of objective analysis of what threatened not only their own countries but the planet and the whole of humanity and had prepared themselves for these threats, then warning systems would have been in place and the emergency work would have been better planned.</p>
<p class="contents">Large and wealthy powers are prepared to conduct wars, including nuclear wars, at a couple of minutes’ notice. There is no notice or warning for poor people in Asia, however. In the meantime, the world spends grotesque sums on its war against terrorism – a small problem in terms of the number of lives lost – and on a war that, as matters now stand, merely produces more terrorism. Is no serious attention devoted to the problems of poverty and to ecological security? Let us learn our lesson one day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time, we have had a genuine wave of sympathy for people from, in general, the whole world, and not just a part of it, who have been affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Cynics point out that this has to do with the fact that the area around the Indian Ocean contained so many tourists from rich countries who were also affected when the disaster happened. That is true, but it must be remembered that this, at the same time, shows that tourism, like trade in goods and services, in actual fact brings the people of the world together and makes us realise that we belong together.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless feel uncomfortable about the fact that, in this case, the EU seems mainly to be interested in promoting its own stances in connection with this tragedy which, upon examination, reveals that what are needed are warning systems, not the EU. It is a global issue, and one that is principally for the UN. Money does not need to be channelled via the EU; it should come directly from the relevant countries and people. The issue is one of coordinating operational aid, and that is the main task of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">What task remains? That of rapid intervention to evacuate citizens of EU countries. In this case, the problem was not that the EU had no policy but that some countries, such as Italy, implemented this very well while other countries, such as my own, implemented it badly. We must not try to use tragedies for EU purposes, but look to see what the EU in actual fact has to contribute, presumably in terms of consular services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, they are concerned that the funds pledged will, in actual fact, not be made available. Secondly, they wish to rebuild through their own efforts the lives and natural resources that have been destroyed. Thirdly, people are afraid that assistance will disappear into the donors' bureaucracy. As a representative of a new Member State I can understand this, as aid that had been granted to us was sometimes diverted into the coffers of the donors' own consultants.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do to dispel these concerns? Firstly, I should like to stress the difference between aid given to Africa, for example, where severe and long-term structural problems need to be resolved and where it is sometimes difficult to absorb resources, and the region now hit by the disaster, where people need rapid and immediate assistance, where ordinary economic life needs to be rebuilt, where people know how to work and know what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the first instance, European aid must be unbureaucratic and should be awarded also in the form of small grants, for example, directly for the reconstruction of small fisheries, tourism and other types of activities. Secondly, given that the UN has the main coordinating role, Parliament should hear the UN's opinion at the next session, on both the situation and the use of aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can be proud of the substantial amount that the European Union is preparing to remit to the countries in South-East Asia, an amount decided on at the Geneva donors’ conference. Nevertheless, last week’s joint meeting in Brussels of the development, foreign affairs and budget committees gives us reason to fear that this is simply a matter of deploying funds allocated to development.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the decision has been taken to mobilise EUR 100 million from the emergency aid reserve, we do not at present know what will be the actual share of reallocated credits and that of the funds that have just been raised. As it is obvious that Europe will not be able to increase its aid, it must therefore concentrate its efforts on making the best possible use of it, by directing it towards the coordination of its own responsibilities, namely sanitary and medical projects, the restoration of infrastructure and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that such coordination of sanitary projects on the ground, alongside the UN’s agencies, should be accompanied by follow-up aid, especially in the countries riven by conflicts, and by the coordination of civil and military assets, particularly for the purposes of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where, in order to deal with natural disasters, which are unfortunately becoming more and more frequent, it would be desirable to pool to some degree European capacities for civil protection, an option open to all the Member States and involving interoperable and rapidly-deployable joint teams.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, alongside direct aid and the analysis of what has just occurred, we cannot do without careful consideration of how to prevent it occurring again. Europe could propose, at the Kobe conference, the use of the World Environment Fund to develop civil security units or even to set up a fund for voluntary contributions towards an early warning system, such as exists in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that I think that the worldwide impetus generated by this unprecedented disaster makes it necessary for the developed countries, today, to give consideration to the rescheduling of these countries’ debts across the board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many days later, it turned out that 150 000 people had been killed and 2 million made homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 475 million from the EU is a serious contribution for Asia and for African countries, but as Mr Deva and Mrs Mathieu stated, we see it as unacceptable that some of those funds should be made available by reprogramming funds for Asia and funds from the European Development Fund (EDF). I would add that that also applies to pledges from the EU Member States to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion. The Commission and the Council must therefore ensure that additional new funds are created. That is a tough demand by Parliament, and we will be discussing it again in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vitally important that the UN should play a coordinating role, and that the role of local organisations and local priorities should be respected. Together with our counterparts in the national parliaments of the Member States, we in this House must set up a kind of tsunami watch to monitor whether the pledges are delivered upon and to ensure that prompt transitional regulations are put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">What action is the EU taking in terms of flexible reconstruction to prevent a recurrence of what we saw happening after hurricane Mitch – a yawning chasm emerging between emergency aid on the one hand and structural aid on the other? Commissioner Michel has pledged a scoreboard of EUR 475 million in commitments/funds. That should be done on a quarterly basis, with us being informed as to what progress has been made with regard to the early warning system in Asia. We would like the same system in Africa, because that has so far been refused.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters most in my view is that the poorest of the poor, those poor fishing communities, receive the pledged funds and that they can have a say in how they are spent. If not, the money will be caught again in intermediate layers, which would be a crying shame. I would therefore urge you to give clear instructions to your EU delegations on the ground and to include this quality requirement in your scoreboard. With regard to Europe, I should like to quote the words of Johan Cruyff: ‘<span class="italic">elk nadeel heeft zijn voordeel</span>’ – for every disadvantage there is an advantage. I hope that we can use this momentum together for the benefit of effective European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Massive amounts of aid were promised, but the money never arrived. Terrible anniversaries like these stick in our minds, and in everyone else’s.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of this House and of the European Union depends on three things being done. Firstly, the other areas must not be neglected; secondly, when remitting debt or allocating donations, it must be ensured that they are not misappropriated and used for military purposes; and, thirdly, I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that we need – and as part of the European security strategy – the capacity for humanitarian and civilian intervention. We have already decided to set up the European Civilian Peace Corps, and it is in our Constitution. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we should take up Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s proposals by preventing deficits and doing away with those that occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What needs right now to be focused upon are the emergency efforts to relieve human suffering, take care of the injured, identify the dead, be available to the grieving, and facilitate and support the reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">As decision makers, we must also accept our long-term responsibility. The earthquake disaster in South-East Asia is, without doubt, greater than that which struck Iran last year. Our unreadiness to respond practically to disasters is as obvious now as it was then. If emergency services are to operate effectively, there has to be an international organisation whose national components have taken part in frequent joint exercises and that operates in crises caused by, for example, earthquakes, floods or terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should therefore have an emergency service that operates both within and outside European borders and that always sends help immediately, irrespective of whether it is Spaniards, Swedes or Somalis who have been affected. What, after all, can be more important in a form of international cooperation such as the EU than, specifically, the saving of human lives?</p>
<p class="contents">An EU emergency service should strengthen and supplement the Member States’ own emergency services and civil crisis management and, of course, cooperate closely with the UN. What is important is that it have a permanent structure and be given responsibility in the following areas: analysing – and making plans in response to – the need for future emergency efforts; planning and implementing common exercises; and coordinating and mobilising resources for evacuation, medical care and the transport of food, medicines, clothes and other aid materials in the crisis situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call upon the Council actually to set up such an EU emergency service. I hope that the Commission will lose no time in extending the existing responsibility for crisis management in order that still greater responsibility might be accepted in the future disasters for which I unfortunately believe we must prepare ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disaster in Asia may well have been natural, but it was also an ecological one. Enormous damage was done to wide stretches of beach, reefs were destroyed, their coral filled with sand and dirt, and machinery washed out to sea constitutes a ticking time-bomb. All this makes these regions less attractive to tourists.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority, along with the repair of the damage to the environment – in so far as this is possible – is the reconstruction of facilities for tourists. Although foreign tourists play an important part in the economy, unplanned mass tourism is not environmentally sound. Any reconstruction must be broader based and more sustainable. Lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the past. The disaster can also be seen as an opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the pilot project undertaken by the Thai Ministry of the Environment jointly with the UN and the World Bank to repair the environmental damage on the island of Koh Phi Phi strikes me as showing the way ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would congratulate the Commission and Council on their rapid and sufficient response immediately following the disaster and on the involvement they have displayed. Now, a few weeks down the line, we must prepare one of the most extensive reconstruction programmes ever. My main concern is that we should prevent past mistakes from being repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, aid to Asia should not be at the expense of relief to other poverty-stricken areas such as Africa. The world’s attention is on Asia, with good reason, but tomorrow too, some 20 000 people will die again of poverty-related illnesses, such as HIV, aids, malaria and tuberculosis. Tomorrow too, many more people will die or be forced to flee their homes, for example in Darfur, Sudan and elsewhere. These people should not be the victims of the useful and generous campaigns for Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is how we as Europe can ensure that aid ends up where it is intended, namely with the victims and not, therefore, with dubious or criminal organisations, or in the pockets of corrupt officials. Sound coordination is an absolute condition, and the UN has an important role to play in this. I am pleased that, in Jakarta, agreements to this effect have been reached, and they need to be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that we should pull out all the stops to prevent criminal organisations from being able to make an easy profit from the chaos by engaging in looting, child trafficking or whatever. This is where international cooperation is of huge importance. It is also important, as has been stated before, that an early warning system for seaquakes be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I hope that the disaster will be not only a unique example of financial solidarity, but also a unique example in terms of showing how aid programmes should be implemented. Not only should we give with a heart, as somebody said, but also with our brains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, when USD 1.6 billion was raised for relief in Iraq it was largely at the expense of Africa. We need new, additional money, and the needs of victims of other crises, such as those in Sudan, Congo, Haiti, Liberia and northern Uganda, should not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Our efforts should moreover not be at the expense of the eight million people who die every year from preventable diseases such as malaria.

I believe that the inability of the European Union to react to the tragedy with the same single-mindedness as the United States, which sent its Secretary of State, is a clear indication of the urgent need for an EU foreign minister. I do not share the view of some colleagues. The EU's delay in responding at an appropriate level was deeply shocking and is unacceptable; senior EU leaders were not visible. However, I welcome the response, as now set out by the Commission President.</p>
<p class="contents">The current figure for loss of life is over 150 000, and it is feared that the effects of the tsunami, through diseases like cholera and malaria, will claim more victims. However, we must not take for granted the great outpouring of support from the public, who were way ahead of the politicians. We must now prepare for the time when donations turn from a flood to a trickle, once the glare of the media is turned away from Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two suggestions. One is that we should somehow try to legislate, or to get Member States to legislate, for the 0.7% of GNP contribution, as required by our commitment to the United Nations. I do not think it satisfactory, even in the motion recently adopted by this House, to express the <span class="italic">hope</span> that this will happen by 2015. What happened in South-East Asia indicates how urgent this is, and the Commission should now be trying to work for some sort of a treaty base to compel Member States to meet this commitment of 0.7%.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, implementing a coordinated and sustained effort by donor governments gives rise for concern. Some time ago, a EUR 2.5 billion commitment to Honduras for reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch was barely delivered on to the extent of one-third of that commitment: this is totally unacceptable. This House is not going to accept that once the glare of publicity leaves South-East Asia, the commitments we make now will not be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think it is enough to reprogramme what has already been allocated or even to buy fishing boats in Europe and give them to fishermen in the affected areas. We have to move on urgently from words to deeds, cancelling the debts of all poor countries, opening our markets to trade with those countries, allocating 0.39% of Europe’s GIP to development aid by 2006 – in line with the moral commitment we accepted at Monterey – and, lastly, establishing a levy on international transactions to finance development and thus to meet the Millennium Objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are three points I should like to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is a point I should like to consider in my capacity as a member of the Subcommittee on Human Rights. One of the shadowy sides of tourism in that area, including large-scale tourism from Europe, is the trade in women and children and the violation of children’s rights. A situation such as this again makes evident how dark this shadow is. It would be right and proper for the European Union to make money and manpower available to tackle that very issue and to demonstrate, in that dark situation, that we too are on the side of the people, and to solve that great evil.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the enormous damage suffered by fisheries. As we in Europe have a great deal of expertise in that area, it would be appropriate if the European Union, as well as concluding fisheries agreements across the world, were to assist those coastal areas at this particular time, ensuring that the necessary attention is given to equipping fishing vessels and safe fishing, that high levels of funds are invested in this area and that we focus on this accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns food aid. Very often in large-scale food aid, we notice that, due to enormous price rises on account of the enormous extra demand arising in those areas, the poor in nearby regions suffer as a result. In that respect, the European Union could play a leading role in ensuring that those markets are not disrupted, and that in terms of food purchasing, it is considered worldwide how that issue could be solved. It is then that the quality of aid can improve in the areas close to those affected, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the UN and the EU are taking action but they must learn a lesson from this. We need to make global the early-warning system that could have saved lives; the EU's Galileo system could help. We need to invest in the Union's civil protection system, coordinating and strengthening prevention and the rapid-response capability for all Member States. We need to make use of the Union's military logistics – not just for Member States – to assist in the accessible areas affected and to invest in capacities and their rapid implementation in similar emergencies in the future. We need to follow closely and politically the reconstruction in Aceh and in Sri Lanka to prevent the resumption of war.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the EU and its Member States need to honour commitments under the Millennium Declaration and engage all rich nations in fighting the tsunamis of poverty, which kill hundreds of thousands every month through hunger, disease and war, in particular in Africa.</p>

On Monday, we had a meeting with the Commission to discuss what concrete financial aid the EU could provide, thus backing up its words with practical action. It is encouraging that sufficient funds have been made available, but it is doubtful whether it will reach those who need it. In the EU, people have donated billions; one television programme in Germany brought in EUR 40 million. Those who are often accused of being interested only in themselves did not look away; when reports were shown of the hell in paradise, they were watching them. It is to be hoped that the measures that have been planned will succeed; I am thinking here of, for example, the installation of satellite-based early warning systems – to which Members have referred – to prevent disasters. There is also the need for the speedy reconstruction of villages, towns and the environment on which people depend for their livelihoods and for expert care for traumatised widows and orphans. What particularly concerns me now is the aftermath; if the survivors are to be helped in the long term, we need partners and allies in the shape of NGOs, many volunteers who can help people where they are, and we also need effective structures to develop partnerships between towns. Some of these have not yet come into being. Tourism must be revived there; these ASEAN and SAARC countries, some of which I know well, are waiting for us, their friends, to return to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that people will still be helped when the newspapers have found other things to write about and the cameras have been switched off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a matter for shame, though, that a debate is now being set in motion as to whether Germany, among other countries, is even in a position to help.

We are witnesses to one of the greatest of natural disasters and know that it is not the only one in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in a global world, faced with global responsibilities, and we are in search of global solutions. We have to acknowledge our increasing dependence on one another and that we are closer to one another than day-to-day political polemics and debate would have us believe.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank those people who, even though affected by the disaster and with needs of their own, helped many citizens of our Member States. I would like to thank the millions of donors, who, rather than averting their gaze, are looking to see what they can do; who are not merely lamenting the disaster, but doing something about it. I would also like to thank the public services, the aid organisations and the volunteers, who set their hands to the task immediately. I do also have a request. I would ask the Commission to make haste to put the projects out to tender, so that the co-funding can be secured and all offers of help can be coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would ask that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s request should not simply be filed away in a drawer, for we were all taken by surprise by the violence and extent of the catastrophe. Even at home, in our own states, we can do more in the way of crisis management, coordination and prevention. We still have to learn what could be done better.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to ask the Commission whether, in the interests of long-term support for its aid measures to the worst-hit countries, it is contemplating making use of the Regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from July 2005 to the end of 2008, and, if that is the case, by how much does it envisage the preferences for the benefit of the affected countries being extended? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must do more than merely send funds, however. We cannot limit our role to that of a generous donor who believes that sending out money will solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We must plan a programme of long-term infrastructure and economic reconstruction in the countries of South-East Asia and Africa affected by the tsunami tragedy. In addition, a special early-warning system should be put in place to protect the international community from similar disasters in future, and special funds should be set aside for these measures. As a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia, I would ask that this Delegation become an active and natural point of reference for issues concerning aid for tsunami victims and measures to prevent any irregular use of funds, as the latter could occur if proper monitoring procedures are not put in place.

A belief that certain interests, and not always innocent ones, are trying to profit from this aid, or in other words that this aid is not in fact unselfish, but that it serves a particular purpose, is also occasionally behind these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I do not share such concerns in the face of an act of solidarity on such an unprecedented international scale. On the contrary, I would be more than happy to see nothing but solidarity in our conflict-filled world, and nothing but solidarity of this kind, not hostile or violent solidarity aimed at pitting the strongest against the weakest.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least two issues to which we must turn our attention, however. The first is the following question: why are the financial contributions of individual countries noted so scrupulously in lists of aid donated? Why do we refer to the contributions made by Germany, France or Sweden, and not the to contribution made by the European Community? We are Europeans, after all. We stress this fact at every given opportunity, yet unfortunately as soon as money is involved, nationalist sentiments come to the fore.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question relates not to the principles according to which aid is granted, but to the way it is organised. The tragedy in Asia has made us painfully aware that, just as we need a central headquarters where military actions are coordinated in times of war, we need a central headquarters where aid can be coordinated whenever disasters occur on a scale such as that in Asia. We are all aware that we live in a divided world, and that we will not succeed in setting up such an institute at a global level, but we must set up a rapid reaction centre of this kind at EU level. Voltaire called for such a thing after the earthquake in Lisbon, an event he could not accept as he claimed it defied his reason. Today we know that such events do not defy rational thinking, and this is all the more reason why we must take rational steps to counter them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot could have been done differently, both at EU level and in those countries mainly affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically, the problem is that, generally speaking, too little attention has been given to the readiness to respond to disasters. It is relatively simple to mobilise large amounts of money both from the general public and from governments in an emergency situation. It is difficult obtaining resources for preventing disasters and preparing to respond to them. It has, for example, been known for a long time that the countries around the Indian Ocean had no system of warnings against not only tsunamis but also other major disasters, especially cyclones. Nothing has been done by the governments concerned or by various donors. The only country in the area that has acted upon the risks and prepared itself effectively is, in actual fact, Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the EU civil crisis force that is now being discussed could already have been established. This is not the first time that the need for such a force has become apparent. EU activity should be more coordinated specifically in this area. Coordination and cooperation are required not only in order to set up this force but also in order to organise all the relief consignments in an emergency situation. There is a lack of coordination in this area. The UN has the main responsibility, but we know that the UN does not have the required capacity. A far better coordinated EU – and I am talking here about the Commission and the Member States – could have been of great help at the height of the disaster. That is something we must pin our hopes on for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the reconstruction. Just like a number of other speakers, I should like to see the EUR 350 million talked about by Mr Barroso this morning take the form of fresh money rather than be extracted from the ordinary budget. If rapidity of response requires the use of already appropriated resources, we should ensure that these are subsequently and appropriately replenished. Otherwise, Asia will, as a region, miss out on EUR 150 million in development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would direct my last point to the Commission. Examine seriously all the reports that show how badly the ecology of the area had been damaged prior to the disaster through misdirected exploitation. In the reconstruction, it is vitally important to take account of the environment if the necessary conditions of life are not to be further eroded and if the risk of further disasters is to be reduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By investing in these we might be able to minimise the number of human casualties. I do not know if a certain organisation hit the nail on the head last week when it estimated that EUR 0.5 would have been enough to put observation buoys in the Indian Ocean to warn of danger, but the funding for this project had not been found. In any case, the example is a telling one in terms of the figure given. Preventive action is always many times cheaper than dealing with disasters after they have happened.</p>
<p class="contents">It has now been decided to establish an early-warning system in the Indian Ocean region. Telecommunications companies will be able to be linked up to the system. They will be able to collect information on impending disasters from the monitoring system and send warning messages to people travelling in the region in their native language. This is excellent – in this way, we will be able to transform this immense loss and tragedy into an experience which in future may save human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that EU Foreign Affairs Ministers and Ministers for Development Cooperation are responding quickly, agreeing on EU measures to help people in the crisis area and begin reconstruction. Nevertheless, we need to remember that the promise of new rapid deployment troops concentrating on civilian rescue operations was not a new and creative idea. It was a promise of troops that was not delivered on in time: according to the decisions taken at an EU summit in 2001, the troops were supposed to be ready by the end of 2003. Now a new deadline has been set for 2007; who knows what it would have been but for this disaster. We just have to hope that all the promises made will be kept.</p>
<p class="contents">We all knew that natural disasters occur all the time. This incident alerted the Western world, as the presence of tourists made it seem so near. Hopefully, this awareness of human distress and mutual solidarity in the world will be permanent. This is about human dignity. Help is needed when the face of human suffering is a foreign one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has listened carefully not only to your House’s suggestions, observations, and comments, but also to its criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it very clear that Europe has been neither inactive nor passive. It acted quickly – very quickly, indeed – and at every level, in providing humanitarian aid, organising consular cooperation, maintaining a state of alert, preventing the outbreak of epidemics, and, politically, confirming the UN in its coordinating role.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been very effective cooperation between Parliament and the Council. This very morning, in the context of the trialogue, which took only a few minutes, we managed to raise EUR 100 million, that being the first instalment of additional humanitarian aid. What this shows is that, in cases of urgency, our institutions work marvellously well. The measures decided on by the Council on 7 January are being monitored on a regular basis and the Council will ensure that any further action that proves to be necessary is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Close coordination with the UN, with the other donors, and with NGOs on the ground will continue, thereby guaranteeing the aid’s maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I also commit the Presidency to a continuation of this dialogue with Parliament and to regular exchanges of views with it on the various measures that are decided on in order to address the problems faced by the countries affected by the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am unable to reply to all the questions that honourable Members have raised, there are some that I would like to revisit, starting with the question of the need to reinforce the European instrument for coordinating civil protection. To be sure, this instrument already exists, but its coordination needs to be improved and its means reinforced. The President of the Commission this morning announced that it would be submitting to the next General Affairs Council proposals for improving this instrument. This is quite definitely an important and core issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the other issues that have been raised, I would refer in particular to that of the vulnerability of children, to which we must attach enormous importance, cooperating fully not only with UNICEF, but also with specialised NGOs in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question touched upon the internal conflicts raging in at least two of the countries affected by the disaster. These internal conflicts must not, of course, be allowed in any way to prevent humanitarian aid being given and getting through to the people who need it. No doubt the European Union will be able to involve itself further in helping these countries to find solutions to these conflicts, by which they have already been ravaged for some time, even for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also undertakes to monitor the performance of its commitments, particularly the financial ones, to follow up its aid and to remain present on the ground, particularly during the reconstruction period, which will be crucial, in that it will follow the humanitarian aid stage, and Europe must very definitely be present and involved in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the issue of debt relief, concerning which a meeting has been held today. I believe that the help countries need with this must indeed be given to those who ask for it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final, and important, point has to do with preventing natural disasters and giving early warning of them. We need to invest more in this area. The fact is that we must make use of all the technological means at our disposal in order, in so far as possible, to prevent a repetition of such catastrophes as these or, at least, to limit the fallout from them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that the Commission will deliver the help that is needed and will do this in close cooperation with you. I thank you for a number of useful comments and suggestions in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the reaction of the Commission's Civil Protection Unit, it immediately organised the sending of Member State experts to the affected countries – the first experts arrived the day after the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the concrete measures to be taken? As the President of the Commission underlined, there are a number of proposals to be implemented, some of them in the short term, others in the mid- and long-term.</p>
<p class="contents">On the humanitarian side, in addition to the support package already adopted, it is proposed that EUR 100 million from the Commission's Jakarta pledge be allocated from the emergency reserve. I understand that the budgetary authority has already agreed to this politically.</p>
<p class="contents">On the reconstruction side, some EUR 350 million of partially new funds should be made available, and funds already programmed streamlined. I have noted your concerns about the reprogramming, but I should like to assure you that this improved streamlining of all the available funds is the quickest way to deliver aid and, in many cases, will be necessary, as some projects cannot be carried out in some of the affected areas. There is a proverb in my country: one who gives fast gives twice. It is important that we bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are the amounts of aid important; the quality and mechanisms for aid delivery are too. In this respect, the Commission should obtain the support of the Council and the European Parliament to use the derogations and accelerated procedures in full. Moreover, the coordination should be organised by the countries and the financing programmes approved by the governments themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, budget support needs to be properly supervised to ensure sound financial management. Trust funds with the countries concerned, based either on UN and/or World Bank trust fund formulae, may be a good answer to this concern. My colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, is currently visiting the US, meeting Mr Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, to discuss these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides humanitarian and reconstruction support, there are a number of flanking measures that need to be taken. The Commission has taken action in various fields: reinforcing EU coordination capabilities to respond to crises; debt relief for the countries in question; trade measures – one of the questions raised – such as the possibility of accelerating the entry into force of the new scheme for a generalised system of preferences; early warning systems; satellite monitoring and research and development; preparation for disaster management; fisheries; justice and home affairs; health and so on. We are looking at a wide range of actions. Of particular importance here are the measures for early warning of disasters and preparation for crisis response. I also believe that prevention is crucial. The best help is to save lives.</p>
<p class="contents">This tragic event needs to be seen by all of us as a kind of opportunity and commitment to organise ourselves better and coordinate action in the event of a disaster. We can agree that the European Union has a global responsibility. Such events can be addressed only in a global way, at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to underline once again that the Commission counts on the support of the European Parliament in order to help the countries and populations in need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
