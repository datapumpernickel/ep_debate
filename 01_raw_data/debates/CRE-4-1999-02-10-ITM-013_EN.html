<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bowe </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, there is no doubt that we are voting a very important report tonight that will become a major piece of legislation. It affects a major developing industry within the Community but at the same time raises a series of major concerns to the general public that must be addressed. I have tried in this report to strike the right balance between the protection of public health, the environment, the rights of the consumer and the needs of that developing industry which has so much to give if we allow it to do so in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already successfully taken the report through the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. We have since then made efforts to find an even greater degree of agreement of the different parties involved so that we can find a proposal which we hope will be acceptable to the Commission as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many key points in the report. I should just like to outline some of them just now. First of all, we have introduced in the text an additional obligation on Member States in the Commission to adopt the precautionary principle and ensure that we avoid any adverse effects on human health and the environment whenever a GMO of whatever kind is released into the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of GMOs placed on the market, we must also be sure that they can be identified and tracked. We have tried to do that with some of our amendments; that the authorisation for release contains descriptive methods of identification and that a public register is kept of those methods so that we know where they are going, we know what they are doing. The monitoring requirements that we have installed in the proposal should help us to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">A concern that has been expressed by many people is that we have a problem with export of GMOs and a responsibility, indeed, when these GMOs go to third counties that may not have the capacity to deal with them in the way that the Union has. So we have introduced the principle of prior and formal consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Many concerns have been expressed by people across Europe about the ethical implications of genetically modified organisms that might shortly come onto the marketplace – even perhaps genetically modified animals. In that situation we have a right to consult an ethical committee. We are looking for the fullest consultation of the ethical committee on matters of principle. I am sure that will assist in the future introduction of GMOs that may present certain difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Any producer must accept that when they put a product on the marketplace they have to accept liability. Liability is an issue here just as it is for any other type of product. We are proposing a form of liability which is reasonable, comprehensive and no different from that suggested for other products.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that the long term implications of these products may indeed be such that there will be substantial socio‐economic effects. While we may not wish to address each of these issues, application by application, we have to consider these. We have installed a suitable amendment in the proposal to ensure that these are taken into account in an appropriate way.<br />There are a number of other substantial improvements to the text in a technical sense. In the annexes we have worked very hard to improve the technical requirements and the definitions of the risk assessment. But equally we have looked very carefully at how we can control these products on the marketplace. While the Commission already has in its existing proposal the possibility to withdraw a product from the marketplace should it appear to present a serious risk to human health or any other risk, the Commission's proposal suggests that there should be a time‐limited approval.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not against the idea of a time‐limited approval. It is a sensible method of making progress, step‐by‐step. But one has to ask, when you consider the range of different products, what is the appropriate time‐scale for a time‐limited approval? Is it three years, is it five years, as some of our Green colleagues proposed in committee; is it seven years, as the Commission is proposing; is it twelve years as the Council is proposing; or is it an unlimited approval as some Members of Parliament would want?</p>
<p class="contents">We have to accept that at this stage, in order to build public trust and confidence, there has to be a time‐limited approval in order that any product which is found to be unsatisfactory can be properly withdrawn after due consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure about the number. There is no magic number when it comes to the length of time. The Commission proposes seven years. I should be very interested to hear from the Commissioner why she thinks seven is the very best number of years – perhaps it is her lucky number. Are we going to suggest that it is twelve? Twelve would appear to be adequate on this technical question.</p>

Various research institutes produce ever‐changing data which are used as a basis for political decision‐making, and which may be interpreted whichever way is desirable. Painting a threatening picture is often the easiest option. Excessive restrictions on research shift the responsibility onto the shoulders of others while the Union sneaks along behind, like a stowaway. But then regulation is an unconditional prerequisite, and this is indeed a very sensitive area of research.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the choice of the consumers themselves which products they wish to consume. Their choice is informed by factors that have to be respected, factors based on knowledge just as much as feelings. For this reason goods must be labelled clearly, comprehensibly and uniformly. There must be an attempt to increase consumer awareness of the benefits and possible risks of genetically modified products. To achieve this objective we have to invest time and money in publishing the work of the research institutes in a language that everyone can understand, giving the consumer the chance to take part in the lobbying process.</p>
<p class="contents">To gain consumer confidence we have to observe the precautionary principle. As our experience and scientific knowledge grows, the content of the directive will naturally have to be reappraised. There would have to be a thorough evaluation of the risks involved, and that would have to extend to an assessment of possible delayed effects. Farmers cannot be assumed to have sufficient knowledge to bear any responsibility, but developers and manufacturers of genetically modified products, having conducted the appropriate tests, will have full responsibility for any harm resulting from the release of any product, whether into the environment or for human consumption.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jensen, Kirsten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Committee on the Environment originally called for the introduction of a European moratorium to give us time to reflect. The Council rejected the idea, but that does not mean there is anything wrong with it. On the one hand we have so much scientific uncertainty, and on the other there is a rather dubious decision‐making procedure for individual applications to place products on the market, so there would have been grounds to call a halt, and even the Commission"s influence has lacked direction. There is uncertainty in particular regarding the question of ethics, the benefits to society and the long‐term consequences for the environment and health. We should not have GMOs containing antibiotics or resistant genes, or GMOs which can cross‐pollinate with their cousins in the wild.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal tightens up the procedures in many ways. This applies to the common principles for environmental risk assessment, obligatory monitoring of products placed on the market, and limiting the period on the market to seven years. This is all very good. It provides the right basis for the approval of genetically modified organisms, a basis which I think should apply to the approval of all GMO products. But the same proposal will exclude products covered by other Community legislation in such a way that there will only be an environmental risk assessment. This could lead to GMO products evading the thorough controls, time limits and evaluation proposed in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned about the new, simplified procedures which make it easier to release or market certain GMOs. This is a problem because the basis we have for making such decisions is too small. Our experience is too limited and too uncertain in the area of GMOs. The technology is so new that restricted authorisation would enable the authorities to have better control.</p>

But I believe we will manage to agree on many points during the vote tomorrow. I particularly thank the rapporteur, David Bowe, for going to such great trouble with this report, for always being open to discussion and also being very pragmatic and determined, even if we do not agree on every point. I hope therefore that we will manage to adopt the report tomorrow on the basis of a very broad consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the PPE Group"s standpoint? We want safety for man and the environment, but we do not want more red tape. I believe it is a big mistake to believe that more and more red tape will protect man and the environment from harmful effects. We need clear rules that match up to the risk. If we bear that in mind, as we in the PPE Group do, then we could say there is both good and bad in the Commission proposal. And there is both good and bad in the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. In the Commission proposal we particularly welcome the improved labelling provisions, compared with those in the original directive, and we welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment has improved them again. We particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has opted for the simplified procedure. We also welcome the fact that provision is made for at least a rudimentary majority‐state procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very negative about the Commission proposal is that it lays down that consent shall generally be granted for a fixed period of 7 years. Let me ask the Commissioner: what is the scientific basis for these 7 years? What risks arise after precisely 7 years? Do they occur after 7 years for all GMOs? Why not after 6 or 8 years, why not after 12, 15 or 2 years?</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of the approach that has become established in pharmaceutical law. If there is a risk, then the consent must be withdrawn at once, without waiting until the seventh year. If there is no risk, then there is no need for a time limit. So we are very much against any general time limit. We agree with the Committee on the Environment"s proposal to make this a discretionary rather than a fixed provision. I would prefer to be even more specific here. That is why we have tabled an amendment. We want time‐limits to be the exception, justified on scientific grounds. But the Committee on the Environment is moving in the right direction here.</p>
<p class="contents">On another question the committee is moving in the wrong direction. I listed a number of points in the preliminary discussions. One important point we are discussing again tonight is the question of socio‐economic criteria. I believe that you are giving the Americans a through ball here. If we make authorisation conditional on socio‐economic criteria, we will be taken for a ride at the WTO. Then we will not have a chance to gain the support of any panel in this area. For that reason alone we should not take that decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE Group"s decision at the final vote will depend on whether the disputed points, which we have also raised in committee, are properly clarified and agreed. I hope we will all be able to vote for the report tomorrow and thereby send out a good signal for biotechnology in Europe.</p>

It contains genuine conflicts between European industry and its desire to catch up with the USA and the more cautious environmental approach expressed through the application of the precautionary principle. I believe that this really is an area where the precautionary principle should be applied in practice, not of course as a rejection of GMOs nor in the form of slow handling of the matter by the authorities, but as a cautious approach to the subject. In my view, a great deal can be achieved through open discussion, not least with interested citizens – without of course revealing commercial secrets – and through careful and preferably rapid handling by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Like other groups, the Liberal Group is divided in its attitude towards both the Commission proposal and the amendments. I personally belong to the group which supports the Commission's seven‐year rule but not the simplified procedure, although a simplified procedure could become a possibility if we considered a renewal of the marketing authorisation for the products, in other words extending the seven years. Nor am I a supporter of creating a multinational application procedure at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems in connection with the complex procedure is that decisions are made through a committee procedure in which Parliament has no influence. We have seen in the past that this creates conflicts later on, and it would therefore be desirable if the process could begin now. We hope it will be possible to find some form of sensible compromise tomorrow – in my view preferably with as tight a timetable as possible.</p>

In my opinion, every effort is being made to fuel these scares, even down to the terms used. GMOs should actually be called GIOs, genetically improved organisms, as they are being created to substantially improve quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The words ‘deliberate release" in the directive"s title imply a deliberately committed offence. However, this phrase actually means placing the organisms or their products on the market only after very strict controls have been carried out and after carefully considered consent has been given for the experimental cultivation of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">These food scares are forcing the political decision‐makers to hide behind the sacrosanct precautionary principle which, if comprehensively applied, would prevent any scientific progress. Yet this progress is demanded by those who want their comfort improved and their ills cured. As a surgeon, this principle would have prevented me from getting anywhere near a scalpel.</p>
<p class="contents">We really should not be using this word of the moment – ethics – for anything and everything as it has a very specific meaning and can be better replaced in most cases by a much more appropriate term.</p>
<p class="contents">As for including in this directive the medicinal products already covered by another directive, as indicated by Amendment No 22, which aims to delete the excellent Article 5, this would strike a fatal blow to research on new medicines which are desperately needed to treat new and serious illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we must make certain requests. Firstly, a full information package must be provided before any consent is granted to the placing of GMOs or their products on the market. Secondly, there must be a rigorous labelling policy. Thirdly, traceability and monitoring must be guaranteed together with a detailed assessment of the risks and benefits involved, rather than using the precautionary principle at each stage. Producers must be held liable for any damage to people or property and the placing of these products on the market must naturally be halted in the event of an alarm. We should authorise the cultivation of GMOs to be marketed within the European Union to prevent our Member States from being penalised and other countries enjoying an advantage, such as the United States, which produces and consumes genetically modified products and these are increasingly invading our supermarkets and will continue to do so. Clearly, we must continue to ensure that these products do not constitute a risk to human health or the environment by taking account of the periodic opinions of appropriate and competent scientific committees.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, scientific uncertainty about the nature and extent of the risks is increasing. Secondly, for certain categories of GMOs, there is proof that serious or irreversible risks do exist. Thirdly, and with all due respect to Mr Cabrol, the precautionary principle has acquired legal and political status and has become a basic principle of European legislation. The directive must therefore be adapted to this new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal does not take this into consideration. Instead, it aims to accelerate the consent procedures and facilitate international trade. The adoption of a simplified procedure for placing new GMOs on the market cannot be justified on the basis of a claimed equivalence with existing GMOs. This concept of equivalence does not have any serious scientific basis. In fact, this simplified procedure opens the door to the mutual recognition of standards allowing products authorised in the United States to be imported into Europe in increasing numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that certain categories of GMOs that constitute particularly serious risks to the environment or health should be destroyed, not released. This relates, in particular, to those GMOs that contain antibiotic‐resistant genes, those that release toxins that are harmful to the useful fauna, and those that are likely to cross‐breed with related wild or cultivated species.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled eight basic amendments which we hope will be adopted by the House. Our group"s vote depends on the fate of these amendments.</p>

By making seed infertile, western firms are making developing countries dependent on their grain supplies, thus perpetuating the unfair distribution of food even with genetically modified organisms. This example shows that our debate on GMOs must look at more than just the long‐term effects on consumer health and safety. We would be missing the really central issues, because what we are dealing with here is an ethical problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that God created reality, and I therefore reject the simple reduction of plants and animals to production factors to be manipulated. As humans we are not masters but stewards, and this is the principle on which we should base our position on the introduction of GMOs. In practical terms this means that we must strictly enforce the precautionary principle, as the rapporteur rightly points out. From an ethical point of view, I am wholeheartedly in favour of this. In the Committee on the Environment, I tried to put forward amendments to extend the risk assessment to include ethical aspects, but unfortunately there was not enough support for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately there are proposals from the rapporteur which give people with ethical objections the freedom to choose GMO‐free products. I think it is highly desirable for GMOs to be traceable through clear labelling and the preservation of GMO‐free production chains.</p>

It means, he who goes cautiously, goes safely and goes far. I believe it is a proverb that the rapporteur, whom I thank for his work, has borne in mind in his proposals. He has made the Commission proposal more precise, careful and safer in a number of areas. I believe it is indeed necessary to take that approach in a field in which we do not yet have the necessary experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have the time to go into every individual point so I will only comment on a few that I regard as most important. I think it is most important that the precautionary principle is specifically enshrined. In my opinion, now that it is enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, we should do so in all legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it most important that Parliament"s proposal makes greater provision for information, for involvement of the public. It is also most important to ensure that genetically modified products and organisms can be identified, to make it easier to recover them and also to assess the risk. Risk evaluation of long‐term effects has been enshrined, as has the possibility for Member States to set additional requirements for environmentally sensitive areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it most important – and here I would second the rapporteur"s question to the Commissioner – for consent to be limited rather than unlimited. There are other areas of environmental legislation where we find that unlimited authorisation has been granted for plant and then at a time when we already have quite different legislation, that plant can go on operating under the old limit values for a long time and does not have to adapt to new technology. So I believe it is necessary to set limits. But I would also have liked to ask the Commissioner whether seven years is the right period, or whether there could not be a different, more appropriate number. For it is important when we inform the people to be able to tell them why a particular decision was taken rather than another one.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Members will endorse the Environment Committee"s proposals at the vote tomorrow, so that we can present the Council with a proposal that takes account of what this Parliament stands for, namely concern for the citizens of Europe.</p>

As a result, we should welcome some of the proposals that improve on previous provisions, such as the introduction of a mandatory post‐marketing monitoring system for products, the introduction of clear risk assessment criteria, the classification of the experimental releases of products, an improvement in administrative procedures and increased transparency throughout the process.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all improvements and I therefore find it difficult to understand many of the amendments that have been tabled in the Committee on the Environment. They seem to reflect an excessive desire for control.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology in general and genetic manipulation techniques provide great hope for humanity. They are not a threat and we must get that message across to the whole of society. We must also get rid of the whole unscientific mentality surrounding this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow fundamentalist political ideas to hide behind the cloak of ethical objections. We cannot forget that the patent laws already take account of the ethical dimension and public policy before a patent is granted. In addition, we have always rejected socio‐economic criteria when approving the release of any product onto the market. This is political pro‐activism pure and simple.</p>

It confronts a number of important issues as does the report by Mr Bowe. However, it misses one major strategic point and that arises from the fact that European citizens are very much more concerned about GMOs and their potential effects than other populations, particularly in North America. What is missing from the recommendations here, and the directive, is the provisions for Member States to apply moratoria that are not necessarily based on strict existing scientific opinion. What I would want to see, certainly in the second reading of this directive, is provision for Member States at least to put forward moratoria for five years while that research is taking place.</p>

Genetic research has much to offer mankind in alleviating disease, enhancing food security and quality and in the area of environmental protection. Understandably, there have been many concerns raised in relation to this new and developing science. They include lack of product labelling, environmental effects, antibiotic markers used in the selection process along with ethical, moral and social considerations. These issues need debating and both consumers and public are right to be cautious.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of food safety, I repeat my view that only after the most stringent tests should genetically modified food or food ingredients be allowed into the food chain and only then with detailed consumer information. The consumer must be given a clear choice at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be wrong, however, to deprive agriculture of the benefits of modern research. To do so would tie the hands of the industry at a time when, for example, my country Ireland, as an agricultural exporting nation, must become increasingly competitive. The selective use of genetic research would assist in developing my country's green image and lead to a reduction in the use of fertilizers and pesticides.</p>

But I hope I have no grounds for mistrust after hearing Mr Liese"s statement and hearing about his preliminary talks. I hope we do not drop the idea of the insurance certificate, for otherwise liability would be pointless. People would think we were mad if we said tomorrow that drivers were allowed to take their cars on the road without an insurance certificate. It would be even more senseless in the case of a risk technology to call only for liability without making it compulsory to have insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that tomorrow"s vote will be the proof, indeed the acid test, that the European Parliament can assume responsibility. I was also pleased by the call just now for Member States to be able to apply moratoria. We tabled an amendment to precisely that effect in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but unfortunately it was in vain. We hope you will be able to approve it tomorrow. I hope tomorrow we will send out a signal that we take the alarming scientific findings seriously. A simplified procedure is irresponsible, as is Category I and the majority‐state procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">But what I regard as the ultimate irresponsibility is a 12‐year consent period for doubtful cases. That is pure cynicism, for surely it means that we are using man and nature as a form of guinea‐pig! We believe it is vital to ban antibiotic‐resistant genes, for otherwise we are heading for a therapeutic disaster, and to ensure that high‐risk plants, i.e. those that can cross over to others, really must not be allowed to spread ...</p>

However, it is natural for the citizen to ask how we can ensure that the explosive pace at which this phenomenon is evolving does not exceed our capacity to regulate the issues that arise, while at the same time ignoring the safety of our society and our eco‐systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking all these factors into account, the Community issued Commission Directive 90/220/EEC, which was implemented for the first time in 1991. However, experience necessitated that it be revised. Today we have before us a report which seeks to revise the directive, and I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Bowe, for the tremendous work he has put into this report.</p>
<p class="contents">By tabling my amendments, I wished to clarify the relationship that exists between humans and GMOs, and this because the definition of such organisms in the Commission"s text is formulated in such a way as to include humans. Amendments Nos 9 and 10 which I have tabled help to clarify this point and permit the use of human genes in the transfer and creation of GMOs. In this way, we can produce useful substances such as human insulin and many other human bio‐molecules. In my second amendment, I have ruled out human beings as recipients of GMOs, which would have led to the creation of genetically modified humans, and this would not have been acceptable for scientific, ethical, social and legal reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We must wake up to the fact that GMOs and biotechnology are neither an economic nor a universal panacea, but nor are they a Pandora"s box. This is indeed a force, a force which opens up wonderful opportunities, if we use it prudently and responsibly. It offers us the opportunity to combat far more effectively catastrophes on a global scale which all types of polluting activity inflicts on the environment. It offers us the opportunity to combat the misery that disease inflicts on human beings and the wretchedness wrought on society by famine.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, consumers should be able to make an informed choice, and labelling would enable them to do this. Such a requirement is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the ethical and environmental implications should be explained, and there should be a ban on crops which have been made resistant to pesticides.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there should be rules at both European and international level governing the safety precautions that are required should GMOs be released into the environment. Clearly, there has to be a deadline for drawing up these rules, as well as rules relating to producer responsibility.</p>

<p class="contents">It is obviously very important that we put in place legislation that the people of Europe will have confidence in. I am one of those who regard advances in genetic modification as having enormous potential benefits for mankind. However, in recent months and years the voices of those calling for caution have got louder than those pointing out the advantages. Of course, politicians should never simply react to the loudest lobby but public concern about GMOs has grown to such an extent that it is now very difficult to find farmers in my country who are prepared to have these trial crops grown on their land.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately for the scientists engaged in GMO research, the public have heard relatively little about the benefits of GMO technology and a lot about the potential disadvantages. This is a defect of the debate that scientists still have to put right in the public arena.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive before us is on the right lines and we believe broadly strikes the right balance between the freedom of the scientists to innovate and market the product of their innovation and the right of public authorities to insist on safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Liese that the seven‐year authorisation period is unsatisfactorily arbitrary. If there is doubt about any genetically modified material, then surely it should not be permitted for release in the first place. There are, however, certain amendments – for example Amendment No 68 – which call for more caution and which we, British Conservatives, want to support. In this we shall be taking up the recent call of our party leader in the House of Commons where he spoke in favour of a three‐year moratorium on the commercial release of genetically modified crops until more research is done into the consequences of such releases, especially for biological diversity. Curiously, the British Government, which Mr Bowe unfortunately does not adorn, has ignored the advice of its own nature protection body – English Nature – by refusing to agree to such a moratorium. More curiously still, Mr Bowe and Mr Collins, we suspect, were on the brink of supporting such a moratorium before their voices were stayed by a telephone call from London. Such is the fate of principle in the New British Labour Party.</p>

I should say first of all that the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and I, as the rapporteur, signed a request to the Commission to consider the possibility of some kind of moratorium until the new proposal we are debating today was brought into place and the appropriate safeguards introduced. However, there has been a reference to a moratorium in the amendments by Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Green Group. I hope that somebody can identify for me in the eight amendments tabled by Mrs Breyer the one which calls for a moratorium. It seems to me that none of them do and I do not understand why she says there is one because that is simply not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just say this: I was very surprised by Mrs Breyer's remarks describing the maximum time limit of 12 years as something awful, because Amendment No 75 by her own group itself requires a maximum time limit of 12 years!</p>

The Group of the Party of European Socialists rejected them.

We have done so several times, and each time we have created more clarity in the area, and now we have come to the legislation. I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the committees which have been working on the subject, including Mr Bowe of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out during the debate this evening, the directive currently before us seeks to make the decision‐making process more efficient and more transparent, while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection for health and the environment. In the long term, the directive will thus hopefully increase public confidence in the legislation in this area. I believe that is a crucial point. In line with the precautionary principle in the field of health and the environment, the Commission's proposal aims firstly to toughen up the risk assessment to be carried out before authorisation for the release of GMOs is given and, secondly, to improve the chances of identifying and monitoring GMOs so that the competent authorities can react immediately and appropriately in the event of acute risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I am glad to note that many of the proposed amendments improve on or clarify the Commission's proposal. In many cases, we shall be able to use the ideas behind Parliament's amendments. We can accept 44 of the 100 amendments in full, in part or in principle. Amongst others, the amendments aimed at introducing a means of identifying genetically modified organisms will simplify, though not reduce, the monitoring and inspection measures. However, the Commission will word these amendments a little differently, and we would also like to position them slightly differently so that they fit in better with the rest of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal seeks to meet the growing scepticism of the public towards biotechnology, which is something all of the speakers have probably touched on. The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments which change the balance and weaken the safety net which is built into the proposal, including the principle that authorisation is to be for a limited period. On the strength of this principle, all new information will be taken into account and it will be possible to amend the requirements in accordance with the latest knowledge. We have proposed a seven‐year period. Mr Bowe said this must be my favourite number and others also asked why it should be seven years. Obviously, there are several options which people could argue for. We saw it as a balance between the normal lifetime of a genetically modified product, the monitoring system we have proposed, and the need for the administrative procedures for this directive to be clear, practical and founded on science, in accordance with the precautionary principle. I would also like to add that I personally, at any rate, do not think that the seven‐year period should be extended, which means that I reject a number of the amendments. This applies to Amendments Nos 41, 45, 45 and 75. In the light of the debate which has taken place in the various Community institutions, however, the Commission can go along with an optional time‐limit for the renewal of authorisations. In line with this, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 24, which is aimed at introducing tacit approval for trial releases in Category I. In the Commission"s view, the precautionary principle means that express written authorisation is required in all cases of release into the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Labelling is one of the means which creates openness and reduces public misgivings. The proposal therefore requires clear labelling of all genetically modified organisms which are placed on the market. If there are any doubts, the labelling must state that the product ‘may contain genetically modified organisms'. If we introduce a system which does not require labelling below a given threshold, companies which process genetically modified organisms will not receive the information they need in order to be able to fulfil the strict labelling requirements imposed by the product legislation. Therefore the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 37, 67 and 76.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important question is the liability of the Member States in connection with decisions on product approval. Here the Commission has proposed to change the committee procedure to give more influence to the Council. The participation of the European Parliament in the committee procedure will now take place in accordance with the <span class="italic">modus vivendi </span> agreement and will, I believe, be formalised in a decision on the new committee procedure. The Commission therefore cannot accept at this stage Amendment No 55, which is aimed at making alterations to committee procedure 3b. Amendments Nos 36 and 80 strengthen the connection between this directive and product legislation, and so ensure that the whole framework legislation on biotechnology involves an extensive environmental risk assessment. These amendments can therefore be accepted in principle, after some rewording. However, the Commission cannot accept the removal or any alteration of Article 5, as proposed in Amendments Nos 2, 22 and 98. The question of liability in Amendments Nos 7, 56 and 95 is currently being considered in the Commission, which intends to publish a white paper on liability. A good deal of progress has been made in this area, and the Commission will of course present its white paper as soon as possible. We cannot accept Amendments Nos 19, 21 and 51, which are aimed at regulating the import and export of genetically modified organisms. These amendments would pre‐empt the final wording of the Protocol on Biosafety which is currently under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to Amendments Nos 27, 29 and 32 on public inquiries or consultation in connection with trial releases. The Commission is able to accept these amendments in principle, but we would like to see them reworded so that they ensure agreement with the Århus Convention on public participation in the decision‐making process. Amendment Nos 6 and 54 are acceptable in principle because they confirm that the Council and the European Parliament can request the Commission to consult with the Ethics Committee on general ethical problems in connection with the release of genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise that, apart from the question of the fixed‐period authorisation, the amendments which the Commission has accepted in full, in part or in principle have resulted in a clear improvement of the quality of the proposal. An example of this is Amendment No 14, which will simplify the monitoring and detection of GMOs. In my view, the amendments make the Commission's text clearer and sharper, and will therefore create a sensible and feasible framework for achieving the high level of safety we all wish to see for the release of GMOs into the environment.</p>

We debated Directive No 90/219 exactly a year ago. There too we called for the introduction of liability. The Commissioner said there would be a White Paper in a few weeks" time. But a White Paper is not a directive. Six years have passed since the Green Paper. Commissioner, I think what you are doing here is gradually becoming an insult to our intelligence! You refuse liability by stalling us for six years with a horizontal directive</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like you to tell us exactly why you keep lying to us and in particular why you said there would be a White Paper in a few weeks" time and why you are stalling us again now. Even then we would still be far from having a directive. That means it would still take years. Where, I ask myself, is the own responsibility of industry and science? I find it totally irresponsible and no longer acceptable for you to stall us like this!</p>

We have previously discussed the question, and we have worked on a green paper. It is an extremely complicated issue which produces a great many reactions, and of course it takes time to get such a proposal through. That is why I have emphasised this evening that we will make an effort to have it ready as quickly as possible, but the Commission has not yet finished its work on the proposal. Mrs Breyer also knows very well that these are the conditions for presenting a proposal in Parliament.</p>

She said that because we are in favour of an optional time‐limit that means we regard people as guinea‐pigs. That really is absurd. The fact is that the Commission evidently sees a need for introducing a time‐limit. We say there need to be scientific grounds for doing so. If there are scientific grounds, then it should be done; so it has nothing to do with guinea‐pigs. For there are some areas where no such grounds exists, where no scientific reasons can be found for setting a time‐limit, and that is the issue. The issue has nothing at all to do with guinea‐pigs or whatever but concerns a procedure that is commensurate with the risk!</p>
