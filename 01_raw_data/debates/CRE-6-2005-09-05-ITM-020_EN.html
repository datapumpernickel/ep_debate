<p class="contents">In Declaration 11 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, it is stated that ‘the European Union respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious associations or communities in the Member States.’ It also states the importance of respect for the status of philosophical and non-confessional organisations. Continuing a tradition of informal exchanges – a long-established tradition – the Commission is conducting, on that basis, a dialogue with all of the Churches, religious communities and philosophical, non-confessional, secular and humanist organisations that wish to take part. This dialogue, which mainly consists of exchanging information and points of view, meets with everyone’s satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that such dialogue comes under its normal relations with all members of civil society in the Member States. It notes that the draft Constitution includes provisions giving a more specific outline of the links between the European Union, the Churches and the other religious or philosophical organisations. As these provisions are not in force, however, the Commission intends to pursue an established practice, which will be developed in parallel with efforts to develop its entire links with civil society. The Commission stresses the fact that this dialogue, which concerns religions, the Churches, the communities of conviction and civil society, is conducted in such a way as to respect the principle of equal treatment of all speakers. Within the Commission, that means the organisation of meetings with designated speakers, which are held regularly and are open to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, more specifically, to the concerns expressed in recent questions by certain Members who were anxious to know why such and such a humanist organisation had not been invited to such and such a meeting with the President of the Commission - meetings that were organised prior to the regular meetings - the Commission should like to make it clear that invitations to such meetings depend upon the specific nature of the subject-matter covered. The principle of equal treatment does not mean that all of the speakers should systematically take part in all of the meetings. In actual fact, the Commission and its President are free to develop certain discussions with particular speakers to as great an extent as is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Madam President, the President of the Commission held specific meetings with religious organisations in spring and he of course intends to organise a specific meeting in autumn with humanist organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly pleased that the European Commission sees Declaration 11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam as an incentive to dialogue with churches and non-confessional organisations and is not restricted merely to a narrow legal view of the declaration. I believe, of course, that in this House there is no need to explain that dialogue is something different from the process of joint decision-making. I am also pleased with Article 52 of the as yet unratified European Constitution, which explicitly talks about a dialogue that the Union would maintain openly, transparently and as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">In the work of the Convention I have also called for an open, inclusive and public dialogue in the belief that such a dialogue is both necessary and important because it also entails a closer relationship with citizens with religious or other convictions as they reflect on a common European future.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event I would like this dialogue to contribute to a responsible and unfettered development of new ties and new proposals relating to our future, and to be far removed from the seductive ideological intolerance that we have witnessed on numerous occasions in European history and from which even today we are clearly not entirely immune.</p>
<p class="contents">In the spirit of the declaration and the as yet unratified Constitutional Treaty I expect the Commission to proceed according to transparent rules of the game and transparent procedures, and that it will continue to take a broad approach in the understanding of inclusiveness for participants in the dialogue. I am aware that the fact that there are so many old and new religious and non-confessional organisations makes it difficult for the Commission to make a choice, and such a choice may be impossible without some consideration given to the number of followers of each organisation. It also seems to me reasonable that, in view of the theme of the discussion, the Commission should be flexible in its choice of participants in the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have long been aware of the importance of a dialogue of this nature and have therefore organised such dialogues for a number of years. We also believe that with new challenges at a European and global level this dialogue is becoming even more important. I am thinking in particular of a dialogue with Islam, which is particularly alert to the religious dimension of those with whom it is in dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is undemocratic to confine Union dialogue to a select number of faith organisations and to exclude secularist organisations, as this new Commission has done up to now. We need a guarantee from the Commission that the dialogue it is engaging in will be balanced and transparent. I note that the Commission has not indicated what subjects it discussed with the religious organisations it spoke to in the spring, nor has it told us what it intends to discuss with humanist organisations in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a guarantee from the Commission that this secrecy and backdoor dealing with powerful organisations will cease. Agendas and minutes should be published. We cannot accept secret dialogues with powerful religious organisations, some of which do not countenance internal democratic processes or grant equality to all their adherents.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a critical period in Europe's history. It is a time of confusion worldwide, with unrepresentative groups using terror in the name of religion for political ends. Dialogue is therefore most important, but it must be transparent dialogue. We must know what the Commission is talking about and to whom it is speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">It also needs to be made clear that Europe's democracy is founded on the principle that this Union and the parliaments and executives in every Member State are independent of all religious dogmas. That independence is the best defence for European democracy and indeed for members of all religious persuasions. It is a principle that has taken centuries to establish and it must not be conceded if we are to avoid a dangerous regression in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Liberals and Democrats opposed a reference to a Christian heritage in the preamble to the Constitution because the Union also has a Jewish, a Muslim and a secular heritage. We do not oppose Article 52, which imposes an obligation on the State to maintain a dialogue with faith groups. Cavour’s famous dictum ‘a free church in a free state’ should be the basis for relations between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it is not only across the Atlantic that a regression can be seen: proposed concordats with the Holy See in some Member States show that the division between church and state in Europe needs reinforcing. Relations between Church and State should be based on mutual respect. One of the problems of the secular state is that respect has sometimes given way to indifference towards faith groups and occasionally even to scorn. Belief is an integral part of the human condition. For many citizens, religious faith is a part of self-development, and government at EU- and national level must value and respect individual faith and its expression through faith communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also echo the remarks made by other speakers concerning the separation of Church and State and wish that it applied to my own Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of us have been raising questions because we are concerned, for example, when money is involved and given to particular religious organisations for their events, without it being at all clear what the criteria for that decision were and whether they will apply to other organisations, faith-based or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions also arise about how organisations signal to the Commission their interest in participating in such dialogues and just what the criteria set by the Commission are for the involvement of particular organisations. We have to avoid the ghettoising of certain faiths around certain issues, but ensure that we have a very inclusive dialogue across a range of questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us would also be interested in knowing who decides the agenda for this consultation. There are many difficult political agendas around: for example, on how we achieve the Millennium Goals and gender equality. It would therefore be useful to know how the agendas are determined and who gets invited on what basis. I would echo what my colleague Mr De Rossa has said about the need for a public record in order to allay worries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, churches are public-law establishments and are not the same as private associations. That is why church services are public and accessible to everyone. The relationship between state and church has played a major role in the history of western constitutional law. What is all-important is that good public administration is inseparable from sound public morals. Procedures alone are not enough. Anyone who rejects this basic notion strikes at the roots of our democratic societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when inviting bodies to participate in this dialogue, the Commission would do well to draw a distinction between religion and ideology. Religion is transcendent in nature, while ideology is immanent. It is a God-less religion, a quasi-religion that is motivated and dominated by human desires. Ideology does not allow people any freedom and leads to all kinds of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warn the Commission and the Liberal and Socialist Members of this House against lumping these two very different notions together, as history shows that this results in social disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the law that applies in this case is the Amsterdam Treaty, declaration No 11, which the Commissioner quoted just a moment ago. It may have slipped your minds, but since the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the Constitutional Treaty really is old hat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One hundred and fifty years have passed since then, and there is no longer any point to such idiotic statements. Churches of all denominations, including the Catholic Church, are a part of Europe. They are not only part of European history, but also part of life in Europe today, since it is churches that shape the citizens of our countries. Communities and nations are the first to benefit from dialogue, or even cooperation, between churches.</p>
<p class="contents">I can provide many positive examples from my own country, Poland, of action taken by the Catholic Church and other churches. There are four places of worship close to my home in the town of Wrocław, namely a Catholic church, an Orthodox church, a Protestant church and a Jewish synagogue. All of these different faiths coexist alongside each other in our town and cooperate with the Wrocław authorities, which is a fine example of good cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent days the churches in America, and particularly in New Orleans, have demonstrated that they are capable of more than the incompetent state administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course there should be a dialogue, but it should be on the same the basis as for any other non-governmental organisation. We have to ensure absolutely the separation of religion and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Religions have achieved a great deal on behalf of citizens but, equally, they have opposed advances. In my own country, the rights of women, lesbians and gay men have been opposed every single step of the way by organised religion. There was a mention of slavery by the previous speaker. Indeed, when we were trying to end slavery in the United States, the religions there tried to prevent its abolition.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we should have that dialogue: a dialogue where we tell them what we – the institutions – intend to do, where we listen to their arguments as to why we should modulate or change, but we must have the courage to act in advance of public opinion and in advance of those sectors within religions that would prevent any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">When these meetings take place, the minutes, recommendations and list of attendees must be available for public dissemination. If they are not, I would point Members to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which assures public access to documents held, received or produced by the institutions and the agencies set up by them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, freedom of religion is a fundamental right in the European Union, but separation of Church and State is one of the basic principles underpinning our modern society. In your country, Mr Barrot, the principle of <span class="italic">laïcité</span> is one of the cornerstones of the Republic. I would also remind you that this principle is strongly emphasised in the debate on Islam currently taking place in most Member States. We should not apply double standards, but apply the same standards to ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Religious and non-denominational organisations are an important voice in society and it is therefore fitting that the EU should have a dialogue with these organisations. However, such a dialogue should fulfil the regular criteria of transparency that apply to all activities of the EU institutions. Frankly, closed meetings with organisations hand-picked by President Barroso are neither transparent nor balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue with churches must be transparent, as has been pointed out by several colleagues. The agenda and the minutes should be published on the internet. The meetings should take place in public, there should be an established list of participants and that list should be balanced with regard to the participating organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue should be organised on an equal footing with the dialogue with the rest of civil society, and I would prefer it to be an integral part of that dialogue. Can the European Commission guarantee that it will uphold these principles? If it cannot, can it tell us what its criteria are for this dialogue and can it give them to us in writing?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in reply to a Parliamentary question, President Barroso had agreed to organise the dialogue in the spirit of the EU Constitution, even if it is not in force yet. Despite his pledge, and in contrast to his predecessor Mr Prodi, he has called a number of meetings excluding the humanists – you made reference to it yourself Mr Barrot, and you do not seem to think it is a problem; well, I think it is. He has been reported to have had several meetings with representatives of the Catholic Church and, notably, the Vatican, thus granting a preferred status to one particular religion. I am afraid that your explanation is not satisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it is true that the Commission says that it regularly forgot to invite the European Humanist Federation to this dialogue, but it took the liberty of inviting in its place the Church of Scientology, which is listed as a sect in various European countries. On the basis of which criteria was this dialogue established? Are sects accepted from now on? What subjects are debated? I call for complete transparency in this matter. Beyond the issue of dialogue, furthermore, there is now the issue of funding. Allow me to return to the World Youth Days. On that issue, I cannot believe my eyes. This is truly John Paul II’s last miracle. That is how a ‘no’ vote from Parliament on the funding of the World Youth Days was transformed into a ‘yes’, following a questionable legal ruse by the Commission. That beats the wedding feast at Cana. Yet who are they trying to kid? First I am told: ‘Do not worry, the Pope will pay for his own travel’. Then, even more reassuringly: ‘Europe does not pay for the consecrated bread, but only for the milk of those taking part’. That is how we have become the cash cow of the Vatican. Yet on a more serious note, Madam President, I would point out to the Commission, with the full respect that I have for the young people who arrived in Cologne in search of spirituality and hope, that religion does not have a monopoly on this debate. Secularism is asking itself exactly the same questions: they are the questions of our civilisation. That is why I propose that the 2006 budget include funding for meetings held on the theme of ‘Secularism and humanism within a network of European towns’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like first of all to briefly point out that a <span class="italic">communiqué</span> has been published on the Commission web site to give details about this meeting held in spring. I should also like to make it clear that, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents, the Commission can answer any questions concerning the attendance list. That is an initial practical remark. You are right, the dialogue must be transparent and everything must genuinely be clear for all those people who could be asking themselves questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament greatly emphasises the need for dialogue, provided, of course, that such dialogue is balanced and transparent. I believe that I am able to say that such is the intention of the President of the Commission. There is no reason for this dialogue to be weighted in favour of any one community. I can confirm to you that a specific meeting with non-confessional representatives from civil society, and, in particular, representatives from the humanist movement, will take place in autumn. There is therefore a desire for balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I am totally convinced, not so much by certain remarks made by Mr Combes, but rather by a politician, many of whose works I have read and who I have held in high regard, Aristide Briand, who in fact brought us a law of separation of Church and State, a law that, in my opinion, he caused to command great respect when he had it adopted. I believe that, in today’s civil society, it is necessary for governments, both at national and European level, to be in touch with a civil society where faiths, which are undoubtedly different but which respect one other, are expressed. That also enables me to state that the phenomenon of sects must of course be fought against with a great deal of determination.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wished to say very simply, in the hope that this dialogue might be developed and with respect shown towards all of the conditions that you consider legitimate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
