<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Madam President, there were two issues within my area of competence dealt with in the Commission this morning and I have the pleasure and the honour to report to Parliament on both of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one as you mentioned, relates to the proposals on the amendment of the directive on general product safety. I am very pleased to be able to present to you the draft revision of the directive on general product safety which the Commission has approved today. The idea behind the directive is in fact quite simple. Only safe food or industrial products are to be placed on the market, and this means European products as well as imported products.</p>
<p class="contents">The two key objectives of the general product safety directive are, firstly, to ensure a high and consistent level of protection for consumer health and safety throughout Europe and, secondly, to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. We have undertaken an extensive stocktaking exercise on the implementation of the present directive. The report on the main findings will be circulated in parallel to the draft revision of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">While the general approach of the directive is sound, experience has revealed certain weaknesses which we are now trying to correct. We first wish to clarify the scope of the directive. This directive is meant to provide consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers. It is also meant to fill possible gaps in sectoral legislation, for instance market surveillance or emergency procedures, which are rarely foreseen in specific pieces of legislation. However, it does not apply where a specific sector of legislation covers the same aspects under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to make sure that the directive gives the best coverage possible to products used by consumers. This also means products which have migrated from the professional field to personal use, for instance laser pointers, and secondly products which are used to provide a service. Two examples of that would be hair-dryers in a hair salon or equipment in a gym centre. We want to have a more efficient system. This implies, therefore, additional obligations for producers and distributors to provide information. This is probably the most important element in this amended set of provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation is in fact far from ideal. It is quite extraordinary that, for example, the authorities of a Member State were informed by the United States of a particular product that was dangerous because the provisions that prevail in the European Union do not provide for this. This notification is compulsory in the United States but not so far in the European Union. This particular provision is designed to rectify that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want a reinforcement of the market surveillance by Member States. As you know, there is no good law if it is not applied properly. Member States now will be required to strengthen the tasks of the surveillance authorities. They will be required to establish sanctions; they will have to develop links with other Member States as well, in particular through a network of enforcement authorities of the Member States. This is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors, especially in relation to imported goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to improve the rapid alert system, a system which is operated by the Commission to monitor the information on dangerous products and measures taken. The scope of Rapex, as it is called, is extended to cover voluntary measures taken by industry to withdraw a product. The practical operation of the system will be improved. We now also foresee the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular candidate countries. We also intend to introduce provisions to simplify the procedures for emergency measures at Community level, so that we can take rapid action with the advice of a regulatory committee. I will mention here that we have now introduced an export ban for products withdrawn at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point to which I wish to draw your attention is improved transparency. Consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening. We believe that in line with the general policy of the Commission, citizens have the right to know which real dangers they are exposed to and the measures taken. The limitations to this is, of course, professional secrecy, as defined in Article 287 of the Treaty, but that of course is except when there are overriding public health considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I will say that consumers should be confident that products on the market are regulated in a consistent manner, that dangerous products are monitored in an appropriate way and that information is provided. I believe that this draft directive can effectively contribute to our common goal of ensuring a high level of consumer health and safety and I look forward to more detailed discussions with Members of Parliament in future on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is urgent that those countries which aspire to join the European Union should be perfectly clear about the changing nature of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and the regulations that they will have to follow. Is there to be a regular process of dialogue in which they will be involved?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, could I ask about the process whereby dangerous products, or products that are deemed to be dangerous, are removed from the market. In this instance, is it the case that it will be possible to speed up the procedure under the rapid reaction process for taking something out of the marketplace once it is perceived to be dangerous?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, could I ask him about those products about which many people, including myself, have been in correspondence with him, which are thought to be dangerous but are not so regarded at this stage by the Commission? Flammable furniture would be a case I have in mind. Is there going to be a widening of the area of scrutiny which will take into account products of this sort? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They should be able to be confident in all areas and that a whole raft of instruments seems to have been implemented to that end, particularly the White Paper on consumption and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in order to give more meaning to all the current thinking on consumer safety and in order to reconcile Europe with civil society, particularly that society which successfully made its views felt in Seattle and elsewhere, expressing its anxieties about food quality and food safety, could the Commission not take the initiative of organising a forum for a large-scale debate between, on the one hand, the responsible parties from the Commission, the representatives of governments and members of parliament, of course, but also the representatives of civil society, non-governmental organisations, consumers’ organisations, and professionals involved in the sector, in such a way as to ensure that these debates filter down to the European citizen? This would forestall fresh criticism of us as rather a remote body, a forum that does not sufficiently involve the citizen in all debates. Would you be in favour of establishing a forum of this kind? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, my service is currently putting the final touches to the framework document on public health, and contained in that document is a reference to the establishment of a public health forum, where issues relating to public health, and by extension the food and consumer affairs you draw attention to, will be able to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been concerned by the lack of the involvement of the civil society in the issues that you talk about, particularly in relation to trade. I also attended the WTO talks in Seattle with a view to promoting the ideas that you refer to, that is the involvement of, and the provision of a voice for, civil society, NGOs and consumers generally in the talks surrounding the whole WTO issue.</p>
<p class="contents">So I can assure you, Mrs Auroi, that I am concerned about these issues. I believe it is important that there should be a connection between the work in the Commission and civil society and of course this is something that the Directorate-General of which I have the honour to be the Executive Head, must be closely associated with. I take that responsibility seriously and we will be moving along in this way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like the Commissioner to explain how we can take such an initiative against the background of the common agricultural policy, which runs totally counter to promoting food safety and quality? As the common agricultural policy basically pays for production, and is based solely on quantitative criteria, namely production levels, and as farmers receive money according to the amount they produce, how can we accept a directive like this unless we first make our agricultural policy a policy based on quality, a policy based on food safety? Or is this simply a way of dealing with public opinion, as the public is increasingly suspicious of the food chain? We cannot change public opinion overnight on the basis of this agricultural policy. Why not start by changing our agricultural policy so that it inspires complete confidence in consumers?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was quite a considerable delay at that time which was a matter of concern to everybody, not only the Commission, but obviously Parliament as well. It was of such concern to the Commission that proceedings were instituted by the Commission against Belgium in the Court of Justice. That litigation remains in place, even though the other aspects of the particular problem that you raise have been resolved, because of the delay in reporting this particular matter to the relevant authorities and to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might continue with the other aspect of my presentation to Parliament this afternoon, which deals with the proposal for the introduction of BSE tests, and I have pleasure in presenting this to Parliament this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I have announced on several occasions that I consider the new rapid post-mortem tests to be one of the most important tools in our efforts to control BSE. The Commission’s services have worked on a proposal to introduce these tests in BSE monitoring throughout the Community since September last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently we have three different tests which have been found to give excellent results when used to test animals with clinical signs of disease after their death. The tests offer new opportunities to test a large number of animals on a routine basis. An active monitoring programme carried out in Switzerland has demonstrated that the use of rapid post-mortem tests could significantly improve the efficacy of BSE monitoring, particularly if targeted on animals which die on farms or are sent for casualty slaughter. Since 1998, the Community has a BSE surveillance programme in place which is based on the examination of animals with clinical symptoms suggestive of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission now proposes to replace that programme with a new programme where each Member State tests a representative sample of dead-on-farm and casualty-slaughtered cattle in its territory. Compared with the current monitoring, the sample size will be increased twenty-five to one hundredfold in each Member State depending on the size of the cattle population. I expect that the proposed new monitoring will provide significantly better information on the incidence of BSE in the Community than we have at present. I am also happy to be able to tell Parliament that these particular tests will produce a result within 24 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose to test a minimum number of 65 000 animals per year in the whole Community, and the testing will start in January 2001. The proposed decision does not in itself have implications on the Community budget but that is an issue that will be discussed in the special veterinary committee next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend these proposals to Parliament which have been put through the Commission this afternoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have asked you time and again for quite some time now: do you not consider that making the test compulsory as late as January 2001 is too little by a long chalk and much too late, given that the BSE tests were assessed a year ago? Do you also not consider, Mr Byrne, that taking dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview, i.e. carry out proper screening, by testing one animal in every five, six or ten thousand to be slaughtered, depending on the BSE status of the Member State?

In the event that there is not a clear agreement, then of course the appropriate procedures that are laid down have to be complied with, that is to go through the Agriculture Council and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, the systems have to be put in place in Member States to enable this to happen, so that the dates that I have put on this are, as it were, a conservative estimate. It may very well be that it can happen in a shorter space of time. Furthermore, a number of Member States have already announced that it is their intention to bring forward their own testing at Member State level, and it may very well be that we are going to have Member States introducing these systems in a shorter space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">One must always bear in mind, however, that a system such as this will require not only legislative provisions to be put in place but the technical details will also have to be arranged. Tests will have to be available to ensure that the systems that are put in place are monitored and working properly. All this has to be put in place to ensure that we get the best possible results for the work that has been undertaken and for the expense that is incurred.</p>
<p class="contents">So the best possible date that I can predict for all this to happen and the best estimate that I can give for a commencement date having regard to all these factors is January 2001.

The testing is not systematic or is limited to sick animals or dead-on-farm animals, and so we are in no way giving the impression of adopting a quasi-systematic, and hence reliable, approach with regard to meat quality and to the epidemiological policy which might be implemented.</p>

This was a report which related to a period during 1999, but which came to the European Parliament and to MEPs not very long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings of the report make extremely alarming reading. A large number of French departments – I think about 23 departments – had not apparently been monitoring for BSE in the cattle populations within their departments, although they were departments in which there were a large number of dairy cattle. The conditions and the controls in the abattoirs were such that one drew the conclusion from the report that it is perfectly possible today, 29 March 2000, that animals with BSE are still entering the food chain in France. This must be an issue of great concern to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I raised this with the French Agriculture Minister, Mr Glavany, when he came to Brussels last week. He rejected out of hand the conclusions of the Food and Veterinary Office report and the findings of the inspectors. I would like to know what the Commission is doing about this. I realise that my question will be more properly posed to the Agriculture Commissioner, but Mr Byrne is responsible for food safety, and clearly there is a risk to the safety of food in France if the findings of the Food and Veterinary Office are accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I therefore ask Mr Byrne what he is doing about this report? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
