<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mary Honeyball (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to thank the House for giving me the opportunity to present this report. It is an important report in terms of the schools which the European institutions run principally for the children of staff who work in the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite an undertaking these days. At the moment there are over 19 200 pupils in fourteen European schools in ten locations, including Brussels and Luxembourg. Therefore, we have a responsibility here to make sure that these schools are providing the best education possible, in the best way, making best use of the resources and using the teaching staff and the curriculum in the best possible way. That is what I have sought to look at in my report, and it is important that we consider these issues at this point because these schools were in fact set up about fifty years ago and, although there have been times when they have been looked at, essentially not very much has changed in that time. So we now have an opportunity to look at these schools, the way they are run, their governance, their funding and the curriculum, and make recommendations for improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I have specifically looked at those areas, that is to say, at finance, governance and government of the schools, at the curriculum and the way that it is taught within the schools.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I would like to raise the question of finance. Mr Bösch is here who in fact did a report a couple of years ago on this subject and I think he will want to talk further on this. However, it is important that we look at the way the schools are funded and make sure that we are using our funds to the very best advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular area I would like to highlight is the way that teachers are employed. At the moment, teachers are seconded from Member States to teach in the European schools for a certain period of time after which many of them go back to their own Member States. Given the way the schools are organised, in that in addition to mother-tongue teaching, there is teaching of certain subjects in Community languages, the system as it stands at the moment places an unfair burden on English-speaking countries, which provide proportionately more teachers because there is a demand within the European schools for English teaching. I hope, as a result of this report, that particular issue will be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing which is important under the ‘Finance’ heading is the question of fees and the way that the structure of payments works. Children of employees of the European institutions do not have a fee levied on them, which is absolutely right because that is the reason why the schools were set up. However, these days, many school places, not the majority, but very many places in the schools, are filled by children from outside the European institutions. There are a significant number who come from other government-type institutions and from local industry. They are generally paid for by the organisation which sends them. So that does not present too many problems.</p>
<p class="contents">But where there are real difficulties is in the remaining pupils, who are chosen by what appears to be a fairly random method and pay a proportion of the fees themselves – their families pay for them. This system has come in for considerable criticism because it is not transparent and very often the fees levied are not sufficient, they are not actually reflecting the market rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question of governance, I would like to see the administrative boards which govern the schools have more autonomy. In terms of curriculum, the main thing is that we reduce class sizes so that no class within the European schools is more than thirty; at the moment the maximum is thirty-two.</p>
<p class="contents">So I commend this report to you and I ask for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Siim Kallas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, Mrs Honeyball, your report considers some very sensitive matters and I have already encountered the difficulty which you mentioned in your introductory remarks. It is a very controversial issue and sometimes I ask myself why I am here on this side and not on your side asking the questions, because the European schools are quite autonomous bodies with autonomous structures, which decide a lot of these questions by themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully committed to the cultural specificity of the European schools. It therefore endorses most of the points made in this report, since the sound functioning of the European school system is our common objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the budgetary features, we would like to ensure accountability for all actors through transparency, planning and control and therefore sound and efficient use of our citizens' money. I understand people's frustration sometimes when everything comes down to money, but we must understand that in many cases the devil lies in the detail of these financial matters and they must be handled properly.</p>
<p class="contents">On governance aspects, I am very pleased to note that the report calls for greater representation for the EU institutions on the Board of Governors, more in line with the role they play and with the EU's financial contribution, currently at EUR 127 million, that is, roughly 60% of the overall budget. Experience has shown that the 1994 Convention is no longer equipped to meet the challenges relating to enlargement and its consequences. I trust therefore that I can rely on your support for improving the current governance mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to see that we share the same concerns as regards children with special educational needs, in line with the measures advocated by the rapporteur on this subject. Only by progressing in this manner and by making appropriate resources available will we be able to ensure a truly human and inclusive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as a European baccalaureate is concerned, I agree with the view that all Member States should be called on to ensure that it becomes more widely available. When designing the appropriate processes, however, we must be careful to ensure that the same quality standards are met.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that efforts should be pursued to allow European schools to offer, as an alternative, a leaving certificate for pupils who choose to follow a more vocational education. Nevertheless, I would like to stress the Commission's concerns in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financial aspects, we should find ways to seriously and concretely improve the management and reporting. I still believe that the idea of establishing a yearly ceiling on the Community contribution to the European schools should be carefully considered, as some Members have stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it is important to apply and to revise the so-called <span class="italic">Gaignage</span> criteria, which have been adopted after careful discussion by the Board of Governors, the decision-making body of the European school system. If we are to ensure the maintenance of the European school system as defined in its founding convention, we must have the courage to address the question of the future of those European schools that no longer fulfil the objectives for which they were initially created, without excluding any option.</p>
<p class="contents">I do understand the various expectations following enlargement, but the answer cannot be a systematic creation of new schools for which no justification exists. That would be in complete contradiction with the mission and the spirit of the European school system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur and also the Commissioner have already said, we are now at a stage at which such reports are extremely important. On the one hand, there is enlargement, which the European School system is clearly not yet tackling successfully. There has been a barrage of complaints from parents about the extent of the failure of this school system to cope with the enlargement by ten new Member States despite this being a foreseeable development. I would say to the Commissioner that this is a sphere in which we, and also the Commission, as the Union’s executive body, must take action. The Commission will have Parliament’s backing.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is that, of course, it is very important to this House that those who pay have a little more say on the Board of Governors than 1 vote out of 26. This emerges clearly from the report. Here, too, we are of the same opinion. After all, we are paying 57% of the budget; the Member States 22%, and this is completely disproportionate to our right to have a say.</p>
<p class="contents">A further challenge is that the Heads of State or Government never tire of inventing new agencies. The Commission is not entirely innocent of this. We should of course add in parenthesis at this point that every agency can potentially bring a school in its wake. For this reason, too, it is important to ask the right questions and seek answers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of the smaller schools, we shall have to proceed differently according to regional viewpoints, which is why we have attached great importance to preparing a certain amount of budgetary decentralisation. The Member States will have to be held more financially responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European schools system has proved its worth. Having paid particular attention to the Luxembourg school, I would like to congratulate the teachers and the management who have succeeded in bringing together, under the same system, children and teachers from the various Member States of the European Union. Multilingualism has also been able to prove its worth, just as one school system for the various EU nationalities has done, in spite of temporary overcrowding in the schools in Luxembourg and Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not, Commissioner, evaluate in the medium term the European schools system and expand the multilingual education model, encouraging the Member States to become more involved in it by drawing on the experience of the European schools? Furthermore, I believe that any country that puts itself forward to house an agency should be required to commit itself to ensuring that the children of the officials it is accommodating receive a multilingual education. Ghettoisation of the schools by only admitting pupils whose parents are sufficiently wealthy to pay the fees already required in Category III should therefore be prevented. For the 2004 academic year, 32% of the overall pupil intake – that is to say a third of the children – belonged to that category, for which the fees are very high.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have tabled an amendment to reduce Category III fees for future pupils too. Our committee is calling for class sizes to be reduced, special needs pupils to be admitted and a technical baccalaureate to be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">While the aim of the European schools system is to provide an education for the children of officials that does not neglect their mother tongue, this aim does, nonetheless, deserve a rethink in light of the mobility already achieved within the European Union and of what it will be in future. Mr President, although a British minister declared in 1998 that English would shortly be the universal language – the price paid by English teachers will perhaps be that of being in demand – I am of the opinion that multilingualism is part of European identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe – the EU – is an ongoing building process and its construction has been undertaken in a complex manner. Education plays a very important and fundamental role.</p>
<p class="contents">Different EU education systems are entitled to spread the ideals and values that Europe has traditionally inspired. From this, it will help to set up a sense of common European citizenship. The defence of pluralism and diversity has always been one of the core values that have influenced the European Union. This is one of the myriad of reasons why a stateless nation's citizens continually advocate the whole idea of Europe; we regard Europe as our national environment.</p>
<p class="contents">EU enlargement has provided all of us with a new challenge for European schools. This has to do with a new European Union facing its work. Such a moment will entail greater plurality and a healthy breath of fresh air for European schools. In a truly pluralist Europe, I consider that real multilingualism cannot be just partially expressed and the real linguistic plurality of our continent has to be uncovered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European schools provide the only practical way for many such parents to exercise that right. I have no quibbles there.</p>
<p class="contents">In most respects, the rapporteur has considered the European schools in the same proper light. It would be churlish of me not to say so. I do, however, differ from her on one or two points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the rapporteur defines Category I pupils as children of staff in the service of Community institutions and bodies. There is a significant omission here. Category I status also covers children of the staff of the UK Atomic Energy Authority seconded to the joint European tourist projects in Culham, near Oxford, and children of staff covered by the service regulations of the European Patent Office in Munich. The UK Atomic Energy Authority is most certainly not a Community institution and, furthermore, the joint European tourism project involves one EU pre-accession state, Romania, and one completely non-EU state, Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the European Patent Office, it covers Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and will soon bring in Norway. As I had to stress during the debate on computer patents, that means that it is most assuredly not a Community institution. I am sad to have to make that point again so soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often we see an assumption in this Parliament that Europe and the EU are one and the same thing. Here is another example. This is not a trivial point in a general sense, nor is it trivial with specific regard to this report, because the rapporteur states that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are Category I. She may well be correct, but if she actually means that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are children of staff in the Community institutions then she could be very wide of the mark. I hope she can clarify that statistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most concerned by the Commissioner's suggestion that the option of offering the European baccalaureate outside the current school system should be considered. Could the rapporteur please clarify that as well?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission suggesting that the European baccalaureate should be available in schools other than the European schools? I simply do not see why it is necessary to interfere with other schools in order to broaden and modernise the curriculum of the European schools. If I were a teacher and a pupil gave the EU as the answer, I would have to conclude that it was a very stupid question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EUR 127 million of taxpayers’ money – for whom? Why? Is it not the case that Europe is now so evolved that many officials stay in one place for a very long time, not to say their entire career? Is this form of assistance not tantamount to a further subsidy for this handful of privileged individuals in Luxembourg, Brussels and elsewhere? Is it not also true that, in reality, as a cost-accounting matter, these additional costs should be factored in from the outset when locating and relocating agencies? Yet this is not being done; the procedure is still marked by a lack of transparency. There is a reason why these reports have been appearing at two-year intervals, and it is that these schools are not doing particularly well. At the end of the day, the fundamental question arises as to whether this system, which actually did have some justification 20, 30, or 40 years ago, is sustainable as such.</p>

However, as a result of more complex organisation and the large number of pupils, certain deficiencies have begun to appear, and particularly since the accession of the new Member States last year, when the number of pupils increased significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Some schools have been over-subscribed and this has impacted on the quality of the teaching. Increased demand also requires more funds to be earmarked. The first year at school is particularly stressful, both for parents and for pupils, as from day one they have to cope with adapting to a new environment, a new language, new classmates and new teachers, so the understanding of teachers during this period of integration is essential. The greatest difficulties are experienced by those pupils who have to follow most subjects in a foreign language. Pupils who know a foreign language at a conversational level also have problems in specific subjects like chemistry, geography, maths and so on. The children attending these schools have varying talents and some are more hard-working than others, and not all of them can meet the demands of the programme leading to the European school leaving examination (baccalaureate). It is therefore necessary for pupils to have the possibility of receiving a different school leaving certificate and not only the certificate that they have passed the school leaving examination.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise there is insufficient provision for children with special needs, who require a greater degree of accommodation and specially trained teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">In overcrowded classes teachers cannot devote sufficient attention to children with special needs or those with learning and social difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event we should praise the efforts of all those who are striving to ensure high-quality teaching and assistance in the integration of and familiarisation with multicultural Europe. We should try to ensure that as many children as possible can use their mother tongue for at least some of the time in the European schools, or when they finish school they will have a great deal of knowledge but will not be able to use their own mother tongue correctly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was quite surprised to hear the Commissioner here this evening offering his defence and support for those children when the Commission has in fact defended discrimination against families with children with special educational needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman has found it necessary to present a special report to this House in the light of a complaint made to the Commission by a family who had been discriminated against, and the Commission defended that discrimination, despite the fact that it is contrary to the European Treaties. The Ombudsman found that the discrimination was such that it constituted an unjustified discrimination. It is sad to say that this is not the only such case: a number of other cases have also been the subject of complaint to the Commission, and have also been defended by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Honeyball report and urge this House to support, in particular, paragraphs 24, 25, 26 and 27, which deal with this question of special educational needs and the need for the Commission to ensure that sufficient resources are available to ensure that no child is turned away from the European school system because of their disability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission communication makes it clear that constraints are placed on the long-term financial planning of individual European schools in the shape of staff management and school development strategies. It is impossible to manage any company well in the face of such uncertainty, let alone an educational institution. I therefore very much welcome the proposal to transfer such decisions to headteachers and boards of governors, as they are the ones who best know the current needs and requirements of their institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should now like to touch on a number of areas where improvements would lead to an increase in the standard of education. Many fellow Members of this House, as well as teachers, experts and parents in the majority of Member States, would be up in arms if the maximum number of pupils per class were 32. In most places such class sizes have been consigned to the dim and distant past, but in certain European schools they are part of everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">Classes are not usually so large, of course, but such cases have been known. It is self-evident that a smaller number of pupils makes it possible to apply different pedagogical methods and procedures in the classroom. We must not neglect the requirements of pupils with special educational needs and those who receive most of their education in a language other than their mother tongue. If the EU institutions wish to make good on the commitment they made 50 years ago, namely to offer the children of their employees a high-quality education, then they should give due consideration to these obvious requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to lend my support to calls for the introduction of an alternative leaving certificate, in addition to the highly academic European Baccalaureate, for pupils who decide to study vocational subjects. At the same time, it would be appropriate to earmark a certain percentage of resources for the civic and practical skills needed to prepare all children for their future. I should like to thank the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the objectives of European schools cannot be better expressed than through the words of Jean Monnet, who said that children of Europe educated side by side from an early age familiarise themselves with all the different cultures. They learn to live without prejudice and thus there is born and matures within them the idea that they belong together. Looking incessantly at their earth with love and pride, they will become Europeans in spirit and through education they will be ready to complete and consolidate the work of their fathers and to put flesh and bones on a unified and flourishing Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">European schools, therefore, are an institution which promote the ideas on which the European Union was built. They are an institution which respects and promotes multilingualism, while pupils learn from pre-school age to live and act within a multicultural framework. The 14 schools which exist today provide a common education of a high standard which will prove in future to be fundamental to European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The European baccalaureate awarded to pupils is their passport to university and certifies the European profile of future workers. It is therefore important for more European schools to be founded, probably in the new Member States also; this will bring us a step closer to European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to safeguard and maintain the standard of education, a solution needs to be found for oversubscribed schools, especially the schools in Brussels. The European schools are an institution which need to be safeguarded and developed in proportion to the demands of the times, because education is the most important means of shaping perceptions and because, to paraphrase Monnet, when children become European in spirit, they will find it easier to love their earth and to forge a more substantial path towards European union.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, does the Commission agree that the sharp increase in the number of Category I and Category II pupils in the Karlsruhe European School differentiates it clearly from the other three smaller schools? Secondly, is the Commission aware that, currently, more than 60 companies throughout the Karlsruhe region have Category II agreements in place? Thirdly, can the Commission confirm that its own financial contribution to the Karlsruhe European School has been halved over the past five years thanks to these Category II agreements? Fourthly, does the Commission agree that this school’s pupils now include not only Category I children of employees of the Institute for Transuranium Elements, but also some 50 children whose parents work at institutions here in Strasbourg, and who take the daily shuttle bus?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, does the Commission agree that the city of Karlsruhe only recently invested large sums of its own money in an exemplary school renovation and extension project? Sixthly, why, in its answer to my written question dated 15 June of this year, was the Commission unable to tell me the number of pupils with Category I entitlement within a 100 km radius of the school? Is it still possible for the Commission to ascertain and publish these figures? Seventh: particularly as the rapporteur mentions at the beginning that Category III pupils are not paying sufficient school fees to cover all the costs, how does the Commission justify the privilege – incomprehensible to the public – of its own staff and other parents of Category I pupils, which is that they do not have to pay any school fees at all?</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much obliged to Commissioner Kallas for his attention and for his readiness to provide a written answer to these questions. I would invite him most cordially to join me and see for himself the significance of this site in Karlsruhe at either end of one of the forthcoming plenary sessions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, they are not. Where do they rank according to the PISA study? Are they meeting quality targets? The answer is ‘no’. Are their shortcomings purely due to budgetary factors? Again, the answer is ‘no’. The list of shortcomings grows longer; complaints by parents and pupils grow louder. Action is needed, as indeed the present report makes plain for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use my speaking time to give a voice to the letters of complaint I have received from parents and pupils. They complain of overcrowding in the European Schools. In Brussels, there has been an intake of 8 600 pupils this year, although the intended number was just 7 300. The classes are too large. High-achieving pupils are rarely being stretched or encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second school year following the major enlargement, the languages of the new Member States are still not on the curriculum. The availability of languages rapidly decreases if pupils put the main emphasis on scientific subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the role of the ‘educational advisers’, as they are known, remains unclear. The European Schools lack an appropriate administrative culture. Letters are going unanswered. The European Schools and their heads need more efficient disciplinary control. There are often failures in control at Member State level, and there is insufficient provision for control at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In May, the Commission received a petition from parents of pupils in the German language section at Woluwé, voicing their concern and asking the fundamental question as to whether a fourth German language section would be set up in Brussels at all, and whether the German section would be forced to move from Woluwé to Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">These are questions about questions, not just questions about money. I would ask the Commissioner to tell us how he is dealing with these misgivings on the part of parents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, once again I must say that a lot of these questions – or at least some of these questions – should not be addressed to me but to the board of governors. I know about the problem of overcrowded schools in Brussels very well because when I started my work I was immediately made aware of the urgent need for additional schools.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore approached the Belgian authorities, who provide the schools, and asked them to speed up the process of building a new school. A very interesting picture emerged. We have a school, we have three categories of pupils, we have category 3 pupils, and we at the Commission say that there has been an increase in the number of officials in the European institutions with children and we have to provide these children with normal conditions in schools, but in fact they cannot go to these schools because they are overcrowded and the schools themselves have taken in a lot of category 3 pupils.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has asked the board of governors several times to suspend the enrolment of category 3 pupils until the opening of the fourth school in Laeken, but this has constantly been rejected. It is very interesting; the European institutions are providing money and asking for good conditions for their children in return, but the board of governors is deciding otherwise and they are deciding whom to take and whom not to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we have a controversial situation. The Belgian authorities ask us to clarify the situation ourselves among the institutions, and then we can talk because they are the same finances.</p>
<p class="contents">In Brussels, there is a very big concentration of officials in European institutions. One aspect which has not been touched on at all so far is relations with the local authorities. This is another big issue and one that I do not want to raise. So, please, provide your support, let us take the same line with all the institutions and make it very clear that we need clear policy guidelines on this issue, more transparent management and more transparent decision-making on all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What about multilingualism? From my point of view, I can only assure you that I come from a very small country, and multilingualism and linguistic problems are very serious for small nations. I can only promote multilingualism, and we will try to find solutions to allow the continuation of teaching in all languages that are in use and to ensure that children can learn in national languages as much as possible. That is the main issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Somebody raised the question of whether these schools are like ghettos or some place that nobody wants to go. I investigated this issue a little in Brussels. Of course, the schools are considered to be good ones and are very attractive. That is the reason why there is a very clear desire to have people from outside. It was very interesting to hear that there is some doubt about the question of institutions that are not European institutions that can provide places for category 1 pupils for their officials; we will definitely examine this question.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Karlsruhe, I understand that you do not expect me to give immediate oral answers, but, as you asked, this can be also answered through the written procedure. I will do that with pleasure and will definitely provide all information concerning the Karlsruhe school.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the specific question raised about the discrimination of pupils with special needs: according to the information I have, no discrimination was discovered, but there was just the question of how to cover all costs for this particular case. Parents were asked to provide some additional financing. Of course, we have a special allowance for children with special educational needs, but sometimes we have asked for additional resources from parents in this particular case. That is the information available to me.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that this schools issue is a very serious issue and I can promise you that the Commission takes it very seriously. But let us also clarify the whole landscape: what is going on in this whole entity concerning possible decision-making? How are decisions made, how are strategies defined? In this particular case, again, as in many different cases, a responsibility is being asked of players who are not so directly involved in decision-making. So the responsibility for the consequences is in one place and the decision-making in another.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, financial matters are also very serious. As I have said before, especially concerning education and cultural issues, people sometimes say that we are again talking about finances but nothing can be done. Finances are a kind of common denominator, and in this particular case I must say that we are not satisfied with the current system of financial organisation of this entity.</p>
<p class="contents">You know as well as I do that these things can explode and can have very dangerous consequences, as we have seen in the European institutions, and they can do enormous damage to the image of our undertakings. So, on this particular point also, I would like to ask for your support when we have certain proposals on how to clarify, for example, fiscal management, as we have done in several other cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, on the question of agencies, there is an enormous desire to establish new agencies and new institutions everywhere in Europe. I absolutely agree with the opinion that the educational aspects can also be considered, and so the Commission certainly asks for Parliament's support, and asks Parliament to be very cautious and to investigate all these proposals on all the possible consequences very carefully, including the consequences for the development of the system of European schools. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The summary of the Ombudsman's recommendation of 27 May 2005 stated that: 'The Ombudsman found that the financial aspects of the situation constituted an unjustified discrimination and made a draft recommendation that the Commission should take the necessary steps to ensure that parents of special educational needs children who are excluded from the European school because of their degree of disability should not be required to contribute to the educational costs of their children.'</p>
<p class="contents">They found clear discrimination. I would ask the Commissioner to address that fact and to provide me with his opinion in writing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
