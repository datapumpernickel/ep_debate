<p class="contents">Now we are at the end of more than two years of intensive work, and I think that the result is very good. I would like to highlight the essential contribution that the European Parliament has made to the four texts that make up this second rail package. I would particularly like to thank the four rapporteurs, Mrs Ainardi, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary, for the considerable work that they have done and I would also like to thank their colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have closely monitored this matter. My thanks also go to Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee and, in particular, its Chair, Mrs Cederschiöld, who reached an agreement with the Council at the final conciliation meeting on 16 March, a compromise which we consider to be very balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">This second package of measures opens up new possibilities for development for rail transport in the enlarged European Union, and I therefore hope that Parliament will adopt the results of the conciliation and therefore give the definitive green light for implementing these texts. From that point onwards, I can assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to establish the European Railway Agency as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you a few thoughts on future work in the railway sector. When examining these texts in the second railway package, Parliament wished to highlight the importance that it attaches to opening up the passenger transport market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission itself indicated in the White Paper in September 2001 that proposals would be made. This is why it adopted a series of proposals on 7 March regarding opening up the market for international passenger rail transport services from 2010, and also regarding passenger rights. These texts are accompanied by a significant proposal for a directive on certifying locomotive drivers and crew and a proposal for a regulation on contractual quality clauses for rail freight.</p>
<p class="contents">It will of course be up to the new Parliament elected in June to examine these new proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that Parliament can be proud that we have overcome the hesitant position of the Council with the results of the conciliation procedure on the second railway package and have created a new, practical European dimension for the development of railway companies in the Union. With the amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC, all railway companies will now be given non-discriminatory access to the rail networks of all the Member States for cross-border freight traffic as of 1 January 2006 and – this is Parliament’s achievement – for freight traffic within them as early as 1 January 2007. At the same time, the Commission, Parliament and the Council recommend an opening up of the network also for cross-border passenger traffic for the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are grateful to you for the third railway package, as put before us by the Commission. I personally am not sure whether it is necessary to regulate quality control for freight services – which I believe should be left to the market – and compensation for delays and so on in railway transport – aviation is rather different from railways. However, we will do this in the next round. In any event, we are in favour of the opening up of passenger traffic, on which we agree, Commissioner, and also on the fact that we need a European driving licence, so that we can have a European labour market for railway employees too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to go on to say, however, that, with the new Directive on railway safety in the Community, we will for the first time be developing a European safety standard for railways, that we will be overcoming the small-state approach to questions of safety and will in fact be introducing rules across the Union for a uniformly high level of safety for private and public railway companies. I believe that this will be a major step towards a European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard Mrs Ainardi’s amendment on interoperability as important precisely because we will be able more rapidly and better to coordinate and accelerate technical specification work for rolling stock in other parts of the railway system. Finally, I also believe that with the regulation establishing the European Railway Agency we will have created an important institution which will be committed in practice both to European safety standards and also to the rapid processing of the technical specifications for interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with that. I believe that, by means of the conciliation procedure, we have created the right – that is to say, favourable – parameters for ensuring that in the railway sector too there is a European internal market and, now that we have created the parameters, it is now up to the railway companies – whether public or private, on that we are neutral – to exploit, at a high level of safety, the opportunities in the market and at the end of the day to achieve our common objective of reviving rail transport in the European Union and shifting as much freight as possible from road to rail, so that our policy can make sense both environmentally and commercially. We have thus taken a major step towards a reasonable modal split between future transport providers and a good new opportunity for railway companies in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objective of the new directive on railway safety is to harmonise the regulatory structure in Member States and to develop common safety targets and methods in Europe. Harmonisation aims to reduce the number of barriers to an EU-wide railway network. The proposal defines the main elements of common safety systems, puts in place a common system for the issue of safety certificates, as well as introducing the principle of independent technical investigations in the event of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">In conciliation an agreement was reached on 10 March which was confirmed by the Parliament delegation and the Conciliation Committee on 16 March. Under the agreement Member States agree to keep the introduction of national safety rules to a minimum. This way the objective concerning the application of just European rules gains depth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s powers to scrutinise new national rules were strengthened. It was given the power to suspend the application of a national rule if there is a serious doubt about the compatibility of the draft safety rules with the European rules. The Commission can also act if it considers that a rule constitutes arbitrary discrimination or disguised restriction in respect of rail transport operation between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States will be obliged to ensure access to training facilities for train drivers and on-board safety personnel. To allow mobility of these members of staff between railway companies, it has been agreed that train drivers, on-board safety personnel as well as ground-based infrastructure managers will have the right to have access to and obtain copies of all documents attesting to their qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">This new directive is an important step towards the creation of a safe European railway system and sets out a clear regulatory structure for its gradual establishment. The European Railway Agency, another essential part of this railway package, will play a key role in the implementation, monitoring, development and harmonisation of the system. The agreement reached within the Conciliation Committee fully reflects Parliament’s position at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all this railway package is a major step towards freeing up traffic by means of the railways. We need our railways to be efficient and safe and to provide a high quality service. Otherwise they will be unable to compete equally with other forms of transport. A functional railway system will mean greater and greater benefits to the consumer and also allow us to achieve sustainable development in transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A package has been completed, but it is also true that we have not yet completed the necessary revitalisation of the railways. At the end of this long and educational road, I would like to thank all my fellow rapporteurs who, despite differences of opinion, even seeing things in an entirely different way, have allowed us to work in a way that respected everyone’s points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">As this discussion follows many others and closes the package, I would like to give an overall view of the proposals. In my opinion, this package is in line with the twofold reality of European integration today. It is also proof of the positive contribution that Europe can make to its people in order to tighten links and develop solidarity. The same applies to the reports on interoperability and the creation of the Rail Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the ‘interoperability’ directive, for which I am rapporteur, was to bring the national networks forged by history into harmony with each other in order to achieve faster, more efficient and more harmonious transport. This is essential in order to revitalise rail transport and help international trade to flow more easily. It means that techniques need to be made coherent and that we need to ensure that the diversity of networks does not hinder traffic or cause delays. Considerable progress has been made in this respect and also on how we can achieve it. To give just one example, the black box proposal, which everyone welcomes today, was suggested to me right at the start of the debates by actual railwaymen, which shows that we have everything to gain from the participation of the main people involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, as rapporteur, I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for helping me to complete this task, and also everyone within Parliament and outside, professionals and associations, who have helped me to look in detail into these questions and gain a better grasp of the issues at stake. This is also one of the main reasons why I welcome the report on the creation of the Rail Agency. Representatives of the profession, and in particular of employee organisations, will be on the board of directors of the agency. They will also have the opportunity to take part in working groups on the TSIs that affect them. Even though I wanted other improvements, in my view these two points demonstrate what Europe can gain by trusting and giving a voice to those who keep it going day by day. They deserve strong support from Parliament at the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the other aspect of the twofold reality that I mentioned earlier. In my opinion, this package also reveals an ideological bias towards opening up markets and liberalisation. The unbridled race towards ever more liberalisation is one of the sources of discontent with Europe. The directive on opening up the networks proposes total liberalisation of freight, even though the first package has just been transposed and no serious, transparent and balanced evaluation has been conducted on its effects. Moreover, a date for the total liberalisation of passenger rail transport has been announced, prejudging the debate, which has not yet started, on the third package. I think we need to stop being deaf to the opposition expressed by all the rail workers’ unions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Even on a subject as important and decisive as safety, it is being proposed to us that the first Article be amended to place opening up to competition on the same level as safety. In my view, this is sending a bad signal. I do not wish to repeat what, as my colleagues know, I have already said several times on this matter. I will simply say that, on issues of such importance, with the experiences that we have had in Europe, it is worth adhering to the precautionary principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is a very good example of Parliament adding value to the initial Commission proposals. We have added a considerable amount to them, which I think is positive, and in response we have had great understanding from the Commission and the Council, which means that the texts are ultimately very gratifying to us as MEPS.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to go back to this package to say that, as a whole, we are very pleased with it, particularly thanks to the work of Mrs Cederschiöld in the Conciliation Committee, in particular the safety package, which was absolutely necessary as a strong political signal prior to enlargement. I think that the date that we are reaching is not insignificant. At a time when we want to welcome ten new countries, we have to renew a very strong safety requirement in an area, railways, in which ultimately the job is about safety.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to interoperability, we know that it is one of the essential conditions for opening up the networks. Opening up to competition would not overcome the technical barriers that still exist and which mean that, for example, the Thalys locomotive has to take on board computer equipment capable of reading the different control and operation systems on the small Thalys network. Therefore, bringing all of this up to standard and starting on this vast project is essential for the future of the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Agency, I think that it is very important to establish a tool to enable the Commission to work on a more daily basis on implementing this major policy and major ambition for the railways. I am personally very honoured to have been able to bring this matter to a close having made significant changes. These include, for the first time, involvement of all the social partners – in particular, but not exclusively, the unions – in working groups and management board.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have liked to set an example in another area, as we think that for the Agency, the Council should stop requiring one representative per country, which now means that we have a representation of the Council of 25 members, two of which do not have rail networks. This shows the absurdity of the system, which creates mechanisms that will very soon be unworkable, in particular when we want to push enlargement further, towards the Balkans and perhaps beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the commitment made by the Council and the Commission to adopt a directive in the coming years to create order within the agencies and establishing a standard model for all of them, in order to put an end to the disparities, will be respected for the purpose of better governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding access to the network, my fellow MEP Mr Jarzembowski is aware of my reluctance, not regarding opening up to competition, but the fact that it brings with it a number of requirements. I consider that in this text, which is acceptable regarding freight, we are going to have to be careful about opening up to international passenger traffic. In particular, what bothers me in this text is that it states that there will be an evaluation on 1 January 2006, when 1 January 2006 is the opening date. I do not see how we can evaluate a text which will be implemented at the same time as the evaluation report.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note and to conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give you a few comments on our major objective, which is sustainable mobility, and therefore developing railways and waterways, rather than giving in to the rise in road traffic that will one day pose severe political problems. I think that opening up, in the sense in which we see it, in other words as purely liberal, creating competition on the networks, is not the panacea. We are currently blindly working towards that goal. In reality, we are well aware that there is no funding for interoperability. We are well aware that there are colossal investments to make and the financial perspectives do not respond to the request for financial resources made by Commissioner de Palacio herself in order to fund trans-European transport networks and, in particular, rail networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I do not think that anything will be done. Today is a step forward without the railwaymen, because there are extremely strong national cultures in these companies, that is how it is, because they are labour companies. I think that we need to promote sectoral dialogue before issuing directives, which is what we did this time. We need to continue in this way, but I also hope that one day we will move towards a collective railwaymen’s agreement, whether they are employed by private or public companies, so that they can own this tremendous rebirth of the railways which is of benefit to everyone who wants us to have a less polluting method of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, annoying that the Council refused to reduce the number of members of the board of the new European Railway Agency, as Parliament wanted it to. This will indubitably lead to unnecessary bureaucracy, as explained so eloquently by Mr Savary here in the House and, best of all, during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European Parliament’s side, we succeeded, however, in introducing a legally binding document whereby the Commission is to carry out a thorough review of the structure and composition of all the authorities. Efficient management must be based upon the general European interest. It would be a retrograde step if the view were to be taken that the greatest merit of the decision-making bodies were that they were constituted on a national basis, because that would reduce the chances of bringing about the greater efficiency that is needed. National interests may certainly have their place, but they must definitely not reign supreme.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament succeeded in bringing the liberalisation of freight services forward to 2007, thanks to Mr Jarzembowski. His wording means that the Commission must seek also to liberalise passenger services in a similar way after 2010. To ensure rail safety, all railway workers, such as train drivers, who affect rail safety must, from now on, use a generally known vocabulary and system of orders to eliminate any risk of misunderstanding. All trains must, furthermore, be provided with black boxes similar to those on aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">The railway package’s four rapporteurs – Mr Jarzembowski, who was responsible for the report on the development of the Community’s railways; Mr Savary, who was rapporteur for the report on a European Railway Agency; Mr Dirk Sterckx, who was responsible for the report on safety on the Community’s railways; and Mrs Ainardi, who was responsible for the report on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system – have all helped inject life into the European railway sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to develop the railway infrastructure in order to reduce the congestion on our motorways and enable us to fulfil the environmental requirements. I wish to thank the European Parliament, together with the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary, Mr Sterckx and Mrs Ainardi for this important step.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly worthwhile instance of progress was the fact that we succeeded in uniting all the different parties. There was only a minor split between the parties. We were able to maintain a more or less common front against the Council, a fact that is, of course, in large part the reason for the outcome. The conciliation was held in a constructive spirit, and the entirely new mood we can now sense exists between Parliament and the Council found its optimum expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many ways, it was easy from the start because the policy ideas were similar and ran in parallel, whereas in other aspects it was slightly more difficult, but if one is used to debating from different standpoints and if one is prepared for a compromise, then one will indeed find a good compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I think, as a Social Democrat, that this is a good compromise? It is because I am constantly telling my friends that in the last few years and decades, since there was no liberalisation or opening up of the market, the railways have lost market share. What happened was not liberalisation but scrapping. The fact is that, on the one hand, there are heavy goods vehicles, driven more or less the length and breadth of Europe without borders. Drivers do not have to change at the border, and the driving cabin is not changed at the border; there are, no doubt, various detailed provisions about traffic signs but they are relatively easily intelligible. On the other hand, unfortunately, there are still national railway systems, which are separate from each other, which involve obstacles and which of course also make the railway inflexible. For that reason, many companies which, whether we like it or not, have relied more and more on just-in-time production, have frequently found themselves forced to prefer the lorry over the railway. Coming as I do from a country which is burdened by a massive amount of lorry transit traffic, I can only hope that there are efficient, market-oriented but still, of course, environment-oriented means of transport and for me that certainly means the railway.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski was right to say that railways must now do something about this. I have constantly criticised the fact that railways have taken a long time to start thinking in international and European terms. However, I believe that today – not least because of the work of this House – the railways, and even the representatives of the employees, the trade unions, have a European orientation. There are probably not many trade unions that are now as European-oriented as the railway unions, because they know that the future depends upon their being involved at European level. I believe that they are also to a large extent responsible for this evolution. The times when there were still firemen on English trains even though there were no fires left to stoke are, thank God, over and it is employee representatives who are now working, as we also see with the train drivers, very constructively on deliberately giving the railways a renaissance at European level and also enabling them to compete with the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is still much to be done. This very week, we voted on the Cocilovo report. It is not yet the optimum solution, but there has been some progress. Mr Jarzembowski does not regard it as progress, but the good thing is that he must also sometimes make compromises, even in Hamburg in Northern Germany he must be able to make compromises. So with any luck we will be able to find a good solution for the question of the offsetting of external costs. For I believe that any reasonable person, any reasonable traffic expert, would say that we need both rail and road. What is at issue is the appropriate balance. In this period, I believe that a good compromise has emerged. We will see what to do about passenger traffic. I agree with Mrs Ainardi that we need to review the steps that have been taken. Only so far, there has in fact not been much market opening, not much readiness on the part of the railway companies to accept the market. I hope that this will now be the case to a larger extent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur warmly for her work once again. I would also like to thank you, Mrs Cederschiöld, very much for the way in which you have chaired the conciliation committee in a purposeful and cautious manner. This made it possible to be on a level with the Council and the Commission. That itself, I think, is an important milestone in the development of the European railway system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am nevertheless pleased to be able to make this speech on this important matter of the rail package and everything that it implies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to say on behalf of my group and also personally that we think it is very important to maintain and particularly to develop a quality, tight, diverse, secure European rail network, providing a public service to all the citizens of Europe and contributing to a balanced use of land in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the rail package and what underlies it are an example of a Europe that we no longer want, a Europe which has given priority to free competition, very often over any other consideration. It is true that thanks to the fight by the unions in the sector and by a party in Parliament, not forgetting the real pressure of public opinion that is increasingly sensitive to our arguments, the points that were most dangerous for the future of rail have been removed or deferred. But in our view, and in my view, the result is still not acceptable, in particular with the Jarzembowski and Sterckx reports, despite the Savary and Ainardi reports which we consider to be positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, the overall result is still too negative in our view. To conclude, I would like to express my hope that in future there will be more forces that wish to construct the other Europe that we want, a social and citizen’s Europe which we think is much closer to the dream of the founding fathers of Europe than this Europe of a big liberal market that years of liberalisation decisions have finally led us to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a consequence, this mode of transport has lost a great deal of influence to competing sectors, to road transport in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the presentation of this second rail package in which the Commission proposes new measures that will enable us to move towards liberalisation, whilst at the same time maintaining the safety standards required for the sector. I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the excellent work of the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">From our point of view, the compromise that could be reached with the Council is acceptable as regards the points under dispute. The most complex issue was, of course, the process of liberalisation, because this clashes with interests that are deeply entrenched in the various Member States given the special role that the rail sector plays in each country’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the conciliation that has been achieved moderates the more radical proposals without, however, discounting a future opening-up of the market to passenger rail transport. Another point that must be highlighted concerns the agreement reached on the composition of the administrative board of the future European Railway Agency. The principle of including on the board one representative from each Member State, which has already been applied to the other agencies, was fortunately accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say a final word about the need to include a common rail safety strategy, which is ultimately one of the most important aspects for users of this transport sector. We fully agree with the need to harmonise minimum safety standards in this field and the provisions in force in the various Member States. We should also emphasise the set of proposals put forward by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on introducing a safety certificate, on training and certifying rail staff and on introducing a common working language for international transport, similar to the situation in the air transport sector. In short, the compromise that has been reached demonstrates the bold and forward-looking vision that we should all adopt towards the crucial transport sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, reality is still far removed from that. In order to bring the high hopes within reach, a powerful European incentive is crucial. We are therefore pleased with the progress that has been made under the supervision of Mrs Ainardi, Mr Savary, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Sterckx. These Members of our House have each contributed to the setting up and further elaboration of a sound legal framework within which European railways can develop as competitive carriers over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">An important area of concern was passenger transport. I endorse the current insight that passenger transport is, as a market, entirely different from goods transport and the concept of one type cannot be applied seamlessly to the other. Development of this market therefore calls for a cautious approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has spoken; Parliament has spoken, and so have I. It is now up to the industry to take up the challenge. </p>

The Members who have followed this railway package will remember that there have been moments when we doubted that we would succeed in the endeavour to close such a complex chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">The first result that we must be proud of is, therefore, that of having reached the destination and of having achieved the result. The second is that, objectively, apart from some things that may not convince all the respective political leanings – as we have also heard this evening – we must recognise that we have achieved a balanced result. In these four proposals – for which the rapporteurs must, of course, be thanked for the great work that they carried out – we have a balanced mixture of, on the one hand, the urgent need to open up this market and modernise it and, on the other hand, the need to give us guarantees, both in terms of security and in terms of the ability and experience that the workers in this sector bring, which we want to safeguard.</p>
<p class="contents">More than anything, what I want to do is say thank you. I would just like to make one observation, because I have heard comments that I am struggling to understand. When talking about this liberalisation, which some are demonising, I would like to call for us not ever to forget that our focus and our objective are the users of this service. No one has the key to liberalisation as such. We must ensure that, by using competition opportunities, we, on the one hand, effectively improve the service for many users who are, primarily, workers – the commuters on this service – and, on the other hand, ensure that this takes place safely and also makes good use of workers’ professional skills. I believe that we have achieved this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is my last speech of this parliamentary term, I will take this opportunity to thank my fellow Members. For me, this has been my first parliamentary experience and to have had it in this committee has helped me to understand on many occasions that more is done to build Europe in this difficult, regulatory work that has a direct effect on people’s lives rather than in the many, often pointless, debates on the future and meaning of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The wholesale shift towards liberalisation, like other parallel factors, was bound to reach the railways, in the same way that it has reached education, health and water, establishing the market economy as a single and fundamentalist ideology. We do not, out of a sense of nostalgia, want to turn the clock back. We do, however, want to help to ensure that the railways and with them public services move into the future in a way that will benefit the community and that they are not motivated solely by financial interests, serving few areas and passing through at high speed. Interoperable networks, multimodal links, proper safety, environmental safeguards, real participation and liability of Member States as a crucial part of a rail structure are prerequisites for ensuring that this happens. I therefore thank the rapporteurs for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
