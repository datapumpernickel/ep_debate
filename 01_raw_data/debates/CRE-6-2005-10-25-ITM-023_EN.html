<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that the Commission’s proposal has received a very warm welcome from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as well as the rapporteur’s support, and I believe I can say with all certainty that the proposed amendments are heading in the right direction. I agree with the overall spirit of these amendments, or most of them, at least.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I believe it is right to specify and lay down a broader range of penalties, such as the seizure of assets, the principle of publishing judicial decisions, and disqualification from pursuing a professional or business activity; I think it is important to highlight the penalty of disqualification from public office for those found guilty of belonging to a criminal organisation. The issue of disqualification measures is currently being examined by the Commission, and I shall put forward some ideas for reflection in an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> communication on the subject by the end of this year or the beginning of next.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that, in order to fight organised crime, we have to hit those responsible where it hurts most, that is, in their pockets: measures targeting the assets of organised crime are therefore indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of the idea of setting up a central unit in each Member State to coordinate operations against organised crime and to handle the actions involved in making positive use of the assets that should be seized from perpetrators of very serious crimes, that is to say, members of criminal organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Another interesting topic in the report is informant protection. The protection of witnesses and those who cooperate is a very important matter, as such people need to be safeguarded from the risk of reprisals by criminal organisations. I can tell you that the Commission intends to put forward an organic proposal on this topic as well, taking account of the excellent work that Europol is doing in this area and also of the witness protection work that the Council of Europe is developing.</p>
<p class="contents">The final subject, which is particularly close to the rapporteur’s heart, concerns information sharing. We often find ourselves facing criminal activity on which we do not have adequate information or statistical data. As you will probably know already, the Commission has recently drawn up a proposal for a European crime statistics system. It is a necessary part of our strategy for preventing and combating serious crime because, unless we have safe, reliable and above all comparable statistical data, we shall not have a very effective means of prevention that can enable us to attack crime at its roots. The Commission is therefore also working on the statistical aspect of criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude my speech by saying that Europe certainly needs a more incisive and more coherent policy to prevent and combat organised crime, which unfortunately is expanding considerably in a great many areas, from the terrible traffic in human beings to drugs and arms trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe I can speak for the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in saying that we support him in what he is doing. We want to press on a bit harder, but we all want to fight organised crime as effectively and as quickly as we possibly can. We therefore support you, Commissioner, in what you propose and we will continue to push you hard to keep up the progress, if we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak for the committee as rapporteur, not for myself. We recommend full support for the Commission proposal but, as the Commissioner has said, there are little extras that we have suggested adding. We want to strengthen Europol but we want to make it an EU agency. I hope that colleagues can support Amendment 45 by the Socialist Group which refers to there being no more strengthening until it is a proper EU agency. Then we can give it flat-out support. We want to confiscate the profits of organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point that the Commissioner has not mentioned: because organised crime crosses frontiers but law enforcement is up to the individual Member States and cannot cross frontiers, the committee wants to point out – and we voted for this – that there is a pressing need to create a European Union police force. We are not saying ‘create it’, but that there is a pressing need. We have to think about that, however politically controversial it may be.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Commissioner for talking about a centralised agency within each Member State. We need that to coordinate the often-fragmented efforts within individual Member States. He did not mention the idea of an asset recovery bureau, modelled on the Irish system in Dublin whereby a government agency can actually confiscate the assets of suspected criminals and subsequently give them back if they are proved to be not guilty. Because criminals operate to make money, if one takes away their assets, they get very upset. That is the way to hit them hardest. We, as a committee, would like to see an asset recovery bureau set up in every one of the 25 Member States to really hit the criminals where it hurts the most.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee is in full support of the Commission proposal, but we want to go further and faster. I believe that Parliament and the Commission are allies on this. The real problem – and I am sorry to see that the Council benches, as usual, are empty – is the Council putting into effect and ratifying the things it says it will. For example, none of the protocols strengthening Europol in the past have been ratified by all Member States. Europol is still much weaker than it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Commission and we would very much like the Council to move a bit faster.</p>

Nevertheless, the topic that we are debating this evening, the fight against organised crime, is one that the public believes to be a particular matter for the European Union. It is a good thing to ask ourselves this question, therefore. Parliament, the Committee, has done a good job of this. In view of the debate with the Council on data retention, I should like to say that the Committee is a good cooperation partner; one with whom it is possible to have constructive discussions, and which takes its work seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, supports the legislative proposal. We had proposed a further addition with regard to the matter of detail as to who has jurisdiction when various European judicial authorities argue over a case. If, in the space of two months, no settlement has been reached, we think it sensible to let Eurojust decide and exert appropriate pressure on the States to ensure that they really decide who has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to deal particularly with the future, however, and how we can make a little more progress. I regard the reinforcement of joint investigation teams as an important approach. We must make it the norm in European investigation work on organised crime that officers from a wide variety of countries carry out investigations together, tackle crime together. Mutual trust among police and among investigating officers is crucial in this regard, however. That is why we have to invest in familiarisation with the various systems and in confidence building. This also applies to data exchange, to SIS II. We must invest in confidence in these systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to touch on the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to develop a common code of criminal procedure. We do not see this as the primary objective. The primary objective is to reinforce the mutual trust of the officers concerned. The public expects a fight against organised crime. There should be no retreat in Europe, but instead a decisive campaign. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has become so widespread that we need to put in place effective tools to counter it. This draft directive comes within the framework of strengthening European judicial cooperation. It is based on two fundamental principles that we want to see strengthened: mutual recognition and harmonisation with regard to how crimes and punishments are defined. International crime has networks throughout the world and it is very difficult to combat them because they are generally based outside the EU in countries in which it is difficult to enforce the law and which are plagued by corruption and destabilisation. Terrorism is very often funded and encouraged by organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore enhanced the definition of aggravating circumstances so that it also includes mafia-like criminal organisations linked to terrorism and to trafficking in human beings. We have a great deal of difficulty in understanding how this cross-border crime operates, as our law enforcement agencies are themselves national bodies and work within their own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has Europol, a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime. That is why we want Europol to become an EU organisation under the democratic control of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have another tool known as Interpol, which is located in my hometown of Lyon, in France. It is unfortunate that the relationship between Europol and Interpol is not clearly defined. For each country individually to fight against organised crime on its own soil is an aberration. It is imperative for the Member States quickly to coordinate all of their actions in order to increase their effectiveness. As far as criminals are concerned, there are no borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft framework decision therefore constitutes a move towards closer cooperation but, in my opinion, this is still not enough.

<p class="contents">Mr Newton Dunn’s report is an excellent one, but is it enough? I would just mention two aspects that should, I feel, cause us to consider reviewing our strategy further. First, fighting organised crime using the classic police and judicial methods has proven largely futile. We need to look at new, fresh methods of dealing with it. For example, much organised crime is connected with drug trafficking. By adopting a more liberalised stance on drugs, we could help drug users deal with their sickness and at the same time eliminate drug traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in some cases organised crime thrives because it has the backing and cooperation of corrupt politicians or corrupt policemen. Do we have in place in all Member States the necessary effective means to correct this situation, or do we just pretend that this corruption does not exist? Unfortunately, this piece of legislation, although it contains many fine things, does little in respect of the two points I have just mentioned. That shows, in my view, that neither the Commission nor Parliament is yet ready or brave enough to cut deep and remove the cancer of organised crime from our society before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are being asked once again for non-binding advice on Council framework decisions in a key area of internal security, of judicial and police cooperation, which 25 parliaments are ultimately supposed to transpose into national law.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, that means that what we are concerned with is purely and simply a kind of ratification process under the pressure of the difficult task of reaching agreement between 25 governments, without the consultation being binding, without codecision, without Community law, without comprehensive rights of scrutiny, and without any extension of the competence of the European Court of Justice. A continual deepening of police and judicial cooperation is taking place here that, although necessary, does not take sufficient account of the issues of the degree to which the guarantees of fundamental rights are binding, of parliamentary legitimacy, and of legal and parliamentary control, and disregards the conflicts with regard to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This report demonstrates once again that we have reached the upper limit of the legitimacy of intergovernmental cooperation in this field. The report contains a number of vague legal terms, which is surely the most dangerous thing possible in such an explosive field. Promotion of criminal organisations: what is that, what does it mean, what is the legal definition? Particular investigation methods are demanded, and appropriate instruments, infiltration methods and techniques proposed, without the rapporteur actually taking the trouble to clarify the problems regarding the rule of law that these vague legal terms entail.

That also says a lot about the level of disagreement and difficulties within Europe regarding the fight against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a land where judges, politicians and trade unionists have been mown down by Mafia gunfire and where the current president of the region is on remand for having links with the Mafia. I therefore believe that the problem needs to be tackled in all its complexity and that the seizure of assets is pivotal: it is a law that has been very successful in Italy, even though only 1% of the Mafia’s assets has been seized.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that these assets should be reused for social purposes, thus returning the ill-gotten gains to society. In addition, I do not think that the Mafia and organised crime can be beaten just by military action: it will also take political and social measures. In my view, therefore, there is no point in creating a new European police force, whereas it is appropriate to establish democratic control over the activities of Europol.</p>

<p class="contents">In Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, we have had at work for many years one of the most sophisticated terrorist and criminal organisations of modern times, the IRA. For decades it funded its vicious terror campaign out of the proceeds of its vast array of criminal activities. Now that – at least for the present – the gun has served its purpose, the product of its criminal empire is being used to fund its pseudo-political party, Sinn Féin. It is one of the richest political parties in Europe, because it lives off the proceeds of crime. Most notorious of late was the robbery of EUR 40 million from the Northern Bank in Belfast. That is only part of the IRA's programme of criminality, which ranges through fuel smuggling, drug dealing, money laundering and all things illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">Happily, the Assets Recovery Agency has recently struck a powerful blow against the IRA's international criminal network by smashing a money-laundering operation in Manchester, through which its chief of staff, Thomas Murphy, was laundering millions of pounds via property deals.</p>
<p class="contents">If they were the true democrats that they claim to be, there are two Members of this House who could shed much more light on these matters, because their party is inextricably linked with this large-scale criminality. I refer to Sinn Féin Members Bairbre de Brún and Mary Lou McDonald who, as ever when we discuss these matters, are absent and notable for their complicit silence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, there is a lack of trust between the different police forces, which are reluctant to share information, and it is no comfort that this lack of trust is even more acute at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore of pressing importance that the broadest possible cooperation, based on common procedures and minimum harmonisation of legal standards, be introduced as soon as possible. Without such cooperation, we will be less effective in combating transnational crime, and in preventing criminal networks from taking advantage of the discrepancies and loopholes in the Member States’ legislation. The absence of a common legal area has led to a number of Community initiatives intended to align national laws, to step up police and judicial cooperation, to set up joint investigation teams, to create a European arrest warrant and to encourage the exchange of information and mutual assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a framework decision is an important step, insofar as it ensures that Member States will work more closely together, and seeks to forge a common approach, through a minimum harmonisation framework covering the definition of organised crime, offences and types of offence and the establishment of common principles of determining jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mr Newton Dunn on his work in committee and on his excellent proposals. I also wish to thank Mr Frattini for accepting most of the amendments tabled by Parliament. It should be borne in mind, however, that, in addition to legislative standards and activity, this must be reflected in practical instruments for the judicial and police authorities, which need more effective measures to pursue their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by pointing out once again that the prevention and control of organised crime require global cooperation, with stronger and more concerted responses, based on the principles of transparency and democratic control, and that applies to Europol, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The opening up of borders and markets, the improved transport networks and progress in communications have, unfortunately, also become a gateway for the establishment and organisation of international crime organisations.</p>

<p class="contents">In general terms, the present proposal takes a stricter, but not necessarily a more effective approach to the problem. The definitions of organised crime are broader, the criteria are more relaxed and, for the sake of combating it, the protection of the individual rights of the innocent and the guilty are jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we need to stamp on organised crime, but not on the basis of the recent models being promoted, such as the action plan on terrorism.

He has written a book on the ‘European FBI’. So I am quite glad to see that the rapporteur actually knows his stuff.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms I, like my group, represented by Mr Weber, support both the approach of the Commission and that of the rapporteur. I like the way in which the report starts in a dramatic way. For people sitting up here, they should know that if organised crime were a state, it would be the fourth biggest economy in the world. That says quite a lot about the money involved. I also like the ambitious goals of the report. It is one of the key areas, as the rapporteur said, an area where we really have added value from the European side. It is also an area where the Member States cannot do it alone; we need to do it together. There is one ‘group’ that I would like to give some encouragement to: the interior ministries of Member States. They are very conservative on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, I like Mr Newton Dunn’s Amendment 39, where he calls for Member States to collect statistics on organised crime. The only sad thing is that we have not done that already. We should have done it a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Newton Dunn’s Amendments 15 and 29, which deal with the confiscation of funds and goods which have been gathered illegally, I fully agree: those assets need to be taken away.</p>

I think the most important political point is the added value of European action. I cannot even imagine Parliament taking a different line from that of the Commission and the Council when debating the fight against organised crime. Added value therefore comes from the joint efforts of the three institutions of the European Union – the Commission, Parliament and the Council. It is quite clear that the more united these efforts are, the greater the political force that our actions will have and the more they will be a tangible demonstration to large criminal organisations that Europe really is united around this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As has rightly been said, ‘Parliament’s voice must be heard’, and I intend to listen to it fully. An essential point, which Mr Coelho mentioned, is certainly mutual trust among the Member States’ security and police authorities. If there is no mutual trust and if the necessary information is not made available to Europol and Eurojust, the European strategy is materially weakened. That is why some of you – Mr Stubb was the last – did well to mention the need for the Home Affairs Ministers to make substantial progress with their cooperation policies so as to strengthen this mutual trust. I am fully in favour of strengthening Europol and Eurojust and I shall personally encourage the Member States that have not yet done so to ratify all the Europol protocols.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the idea that assets seized from criminal organisations should be put to good use and utilised for social purposes. Mr Catania mentioned that under Italian law – and under Irish law, too – assets that organised crime used for evil purposes should be used to do good. That is an example that I believe could be exported to the other European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, an appeal to make joint investigation teams work even better. They are a highly positive experiment that has produced good results so far. I believe that if this experiment is strengthened and if Eurojust is strengthened – as I hope it will be – we can respond to our citizens’ needs with some tangible, unified action from the European Union’s institutions.</p>
