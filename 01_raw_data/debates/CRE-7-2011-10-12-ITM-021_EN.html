Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the national parliaments were constantly complaining that 80% of the laws they passed were actually decided by Europe; that they were simply rubber-stamping it as a kind of agent of the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has changed that. The national parliaments play a leading role and can exert an influence. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the EU more democratic because it has given greater power to the representatives of the people. This applies to the European Parliament just as much as to the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliaments then continued to complain nonetheless; this time, about the increased workload, the mountains of documents constantly landing on their desks with just a few weeks for them to respond. The important thing, however, is that the representatives of the people in Europe’s capitals now have a means of exerting influence over the European Union’s initiatives – and I get the impression that the national parliaments are increasingly realising this and making use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost two years have now passed since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, when these procedures also took effect. I and a few of my fellow Members therefore felt that the time was right to ask how the Commission sees the situation now. Is it satisfied with the quality of the response from the national parliaments? How does the Commission deal with this? Does it have sufficient resources – including human resources – to deal with it? Moreover, in some Member States, the regions are important, such as the <span class="italic">Bundesländer</span> in the case of Germany. How is input from this political level dealt with? Does it have sufficient resonance? Is there also adequate cooperation with the Committee of the Regions?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the questions put jointly by Andrew Duff, Alexandra Thein, Michael Theurer and myself. I look forward to hearing your answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The subsidiarity control mechanism is up and running, and its implementation has so far been very smooth, thanks not only to thorough preparation by both the Commission and the national parliaments before the Treaty entered into force, but also to the excellent cooperation and constructive contacts between the Commission and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience gained so far has clearly shown that national parliaments are well prepared and ready to assume their new role and powers under the new Treaty. By the end of September 2011, the Commission had sent to national parliaments 139 draft legislative proposals falling within the scope of the subsidiarity control mechanism, and had received a total of 61 reasoned opinions stating that the respective legislative drafts did not observe the principle of subsidiarity. However, in no case have the thresholds provided for in Protocol No 2, triggering the so-called yellow or orange cards, been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that relations with national parliaments should not be confined merely to questions of subsidiarity, and it supports a deepening of the political dialogue with national parliaments, of which the subsidiarity control mechanism is only one aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the political dialogue, the Commission currently receives and replies to more than 600 opinions per year from national parliaments, including their opinions on the content of Commission proposals. One of the questions put to the Commission was about how we are staffed. A unit in the Secretariat-General is dedicated to relations with national parliaments and, in addition, every DG has designated coordinators for relations with national parliaments, who contribute to smooth implementation of the subsidiarity control mechanism and political dialogue, as do the offices of the relevant Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the overall assessment, the question of the subsidiarity control mechanism and political dialogue is an item regularly discussed at the COSAC meetings, where the Commission meets with members of the national parliaments who work in the European committees. I agree with the honourable Member who pointed out that it is very important that national MPs be more involved in discussions on European legislation. We can see that debate on these issues is much more frequent and more detailed, and that the quality of the opinions coming from the national parliaments is much higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to take the same approach on the Commission side because one of the matters raised at recent COSAC meetings concerned comments from national parliaments suggesting that, on some issues, we should be more precise. The national parliaments would like to see more thorough explanation of the subsidiarity clauses in our legislative proposals, and therefore it is a mutual learning process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next phase, we should ensure that sectoral proposals – for example, on the environment and transport – are discussed by the national parliaments not only in the European committees but in the relevant sectoral committees. I believe this would increase interest among national MPs in European legislation, and they would also gain greater ownership and be much more careful when it comes to transposition, which, as we all know, depends heavily on national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the mechanism is working very well. The political dialogue is important because it gives us at the Commission the chance to receive not only reasoned – i.e. negative – opinions, but also a great deal of encouragement and positive opinions from the national parliaments. I am sure that the dialogue will evolve and that the number and quality of both the national parliaments’ opinions and the Commission responses will gradually improve in the coming months and years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the areas falling within the exclusive competence of the EU, the subsidiarity principle is also held to cover, on the one hand, protection of the decision-making powers and activities of Member States, while, on the other hand, legitimising the involvement of the Union in cases where the aims of a particular activity cannot be satisfactorily achieved by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliament involvement resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and particularly Protocol No 2, forms the subject of the annual report submitted by the Commission. The report addresses the issue of whether the principles of subsidiarity are put into practice by institutions such as the European Commission, Parliament, the Council or the Committee of the Regions. It also addresses the subsidiarity mechanism of national parliaments, which was one of the anticipated innovations implemented through the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. In my opinion, Mr Šefčovič, it is right to focus attention on certain initiatives that have provoked questions in the area of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been defending the idea of the subsidiarity principle for many years now. Since 1 December 2009, Member States have had the opportunity to inform the President of the European Commission in a reasoned opinion that proposed legislation is not, in their opinion, compliant with the subsidiarity principle. I would therefore be interested, Mr Vice-President, to hear the Commission’s opinion as to what it has managed to do in this matter, and how it has handled the requests of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue has really been turned on its head.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, instead of the Member States deciding what the EU can do better, the EU decides what the Member States can do better. Now they tell us that the Member States can object! If that is the case, what are the practical consequences of this? The fact is that the monitoring process offers few guarantees. The conditions imposed, particularly the federalist drive that is becoming ever stronger in this process, prevent decisions taken at EU level from being reversed, even when they disregard the subsidiarity principle. First and foremost, it is therefore important to turn the subsidiarity principle back around so that it is facing the right way; in other words, it should be the people who decide what can be done better on their behalf at EU level, rather than the Union stipulating what it believes can be done better by the Member States and imposing it on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far, two years after the Lisbon Treaty came into force, there has not been a single occasion when there has been a sufficiently large number of members – two thirds – in the national parliaments to lodge an objection, thereby enabling the principle of subsidiarity to be blocked. Essentially, this was actually included in the Lisbon Treaty in the clear knowledge that it would not work. You are very well aware that a parliamentary procedure for adopting a decision in just one parliament takes two, sometimes three months, let alone 18 parliaments doing this. Indeed, the figures presented by the Commissioner here speak for themselves: 130 motions – 60 objections. Less than half an objection to one motion, when 18 objections are required. I think that, in the case of subsidiarity, the principle should be applied in reverse. The first step is to obtain approval from the parliaments, after which the next step is to adopt the act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a strength in the sense that Member States can legislate in certain areas themselves, and they cannot be blaming the European Union for everything and say the European Union should do this, that or the other thing. It is a weakness and particularly it is a weakness which we see in the response to the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain things that probably most people would agree need to be done at a much quicker pace, but because of subsidiarity, that cannot happen. Nevertheless, if it comes to Treaty change, it is going to be vital that we spell it out very clearly and work very closely with national parliaments to get the issues which we want resolved. Having said that, it is encouraging to hear what the Commissioner said regarding the responses from national parliaments in relation to the Lisbon Treaty and subsidiarity, and that is certainly my experience in my own country as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also, I have to thank the European Parliament for a very constructive approach towards this mechanism and also towards the cooperation between the Commission and the national parliaments. I am deeply convinced that the good work of the subsidiarity control mechanism and its efficient application is in the interests of all of us. This is not about blocking European integration but about making it more transparent to the citizens and also more democratic, because the issues are, in this manner, being brought closer to the hearts of citizens and to their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much welcome the positive tone and constructive approach of the speakers and the roles of the national parliaments in this debate, because their role is also essential when it comes to the building of an inclusive Europe that resonates in the capitals of our Member States and is closely linked to the concerns of the citizens. The Commission is fostering an active political dialogue with the national parliaments. This has been very fruitful, as has been demonstrated by the numbers of opinions and reasoned opinions. We would, of course, very much encourage this tendency to continue in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question relating to the Committee of the Regions, of course we cooperate with the Committee of the Regions very closely. The Committee can play an active role in the mechanism and, most importantly, ensures that there is a voice for local and regional authorities at European level. More specifically, the Committee of the Regions’ subsidiarity monitoring network provides a very good access point for regional and local authorities, and can enable the Commission, in some situations, to reinforce the analysis of regional aspects in its impact assessments. It can also help the Commission to strengthen the analysis of subsidiarity and proportionality in the future. In conformity with the Protocol on Cooperation between the Commission and the Committee of the Regions, the Commission regularly provides the Committee of the Regions with comments on its opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the subsidiarity control mechanism and regional bodies, we have to respect the Treaty. The Treaty is very clear in this respect, because it states that it is for each national Parliament or each chamber of a national parliament to consult its appropriate regional parliaments with legislative powers. We have to respect the Treaty in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and last questions were on how the mechanism works in practice. I have to say that the national parliaments have been quite efficient and effective in their responses to the legislative proposals from the Commission. It does not look as if they have a particular problem with respecting the eight-week deadline, and we are absolutely punctual when it comes to the legislative deadlines. At the same time as the legislative proposal is sent to the European Parliament and to the Council, it is also sent to the national parliaments. We have seen that within eight weeks, the national parliaments are ready and able to send us their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to do now in the Commission is to be more efficient in terms of responses. The Commission has installed a new IT system which is making it easier to record all the responses, and it is trying to improve the quality of its responses to the national parliaments and to work in more detail on the opinions we receive from the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, two years after the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the subsidiarity monitoring mechanism is working very well. I am sure that it will be a very important tool for involving the national parliaments more closely in the process of European cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, they are supposed to verify Brussels’ right to act. However, if I have correctly understood the figures quoted by Commissioner Šefčovič – specifically, 61 opinions on 139 legislative proposals in September – the mechanism is not working properly and the thresholds laid down in the Treaties to oppose a text cannot be used. The Commissioner seemed to be saying that all this was improving and that ongoing dialogue was taking place with the national parliaments to seek their opinion. Personally, I question the ability of parliaments that are completely sold on the idea of a European superstate to oppose anything, regardless of what the peoples whom they ‘represent’ want! We have seen this in France, when the parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority the text of the Lisbon Treaty, which was rejected by the French people. We are still seeing it with the stability funds and mechanisms, which give the European Union outrageous powers to run the peoples into debt in order to save the euro, when the only solution is to give Greece back its monetary sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, two years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, it seems appropriate to ask the Commission about its assessment of the application of the subsidiarity principle, in particular, according to the data it has on the participation of national and regional parliaments. It is vital that the Commission has the resources to work alongside national and regional parliaments and with the Committee of the Regions, with a view to the effective monitoring of the application of the subsidiarity principle. Some legislative proposals for monitoring the subsidiarity principle have already been tabled by the Commission, which reveal its support for dialogue with the national parliaments. However, it is also important that the regional parliaments be able to participate effectively in the European decision-making process on issues that concern them.
