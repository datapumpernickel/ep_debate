<p class="contents">At the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, held on 30 November 2000, I expressed the Commission’s sympathy with Member States who face the problem of terrorism and, in particular, with Spain, and I was delighted to welcome the bilateral agreement concluded between Spain and Italy. On that occasion, I announced that in the course of 2001, the Commission would submit proposals on three essential points for the Council’s consideration. Firstly, there will be a proposal on common definitions, incriminations and sanctions for crimes involving terrorism. Secondly fast-track extradition procedures between Member States will be introduced. Thirdly, we will submit a proposal on the creation of an instrument known as the European search and capture order. The Commission has already called a meeting of national experts in these fields, which will be held in the next few days, on the basis of a working paper that is being drawn up to present the proposals that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to reiterate the Commission’s commitment, using all its powers under the Treaties, to encourage tougher European action against terrorism, an issue that will be given great prominence in the Commission’s work programme for 2001, which will shortly be discussed in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, Commissioner, the European Parliament has urged that the European search and capture order should be pushed ahead as an instrument providing the necessary flexibility and speed to facilitate the capture, prosecution and sentencing of those who in European territory are violating the most fundamental right of all; the right to life.

That is urgency is most vital. Secondly, on the European search and capture order, as you will see in the 2001 work programme, we shall have very concrete dates and deadlines for the Commission to present its proposals. I can guarantee that 2001 will be a turning point in the fight against terrorism, which is a fight shared by all European countries, not as a problem for a single State but as a threat to freedom, security and justice throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Women persecuted without asylum or refuge</span></p>
<p class="contents">In some countries women suffer cruel persecution and punishment, basic human rights violations which may involve mutilation and may cost them their lives. In many cases, this is a consequence of the application of fundamentalist laws or the carrying-out of ancestral practices and traditions. The European Union says that it intends to protect women from such unacceptable persecution and punishment, but it has not yet found a way of translating its declarations into political actions and decisions offering grounds for hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the Commission be in favour of putting forward proposals whereby such situations afflicting women might be considered grounds for granting asylum and refuge, in political terms, in the European Union?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At European level, a non-binding common position of 4 March 1996 adopted under the Maastricht Treaty applies; this relates to uniform application of the term “refugee” under the terms of Article 1 of the 1951 Geneva Convention. However, there is no uniform application of the definition of the term “refugee” throughout Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the 1951 Convention nor the European Union texts make specific reference to issues concerning requests made by women, specifically women whose human rights have been violated, with particular reference to gender-related abuse, such as sexual violence, genital mutilation or fundamental legal discrimination on the grounds of their gender.</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union now has, following Tampere, a mandate to adopt common minimum rules in the field of asylum and refugee protection, with a view, in the medium term, to adopting a common European asylum system. The Commission intends to table specific proposals in relation to some of these in the course of 2001. These proposals will take account of the specific circumstances of women who have been victims of abuse and mistreatment. Indeed, the Commission has already begun to develop actions designed to address the specific circumstances of these women. An example of this is the proposal for a directive on providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons, which we presented on 24 May last year.</p>
<p class="contents">In this proposal, under the terms of Article 11(4), Member States are obliged to provide appropriate medical assistance or other forms of assistance to women who have been victims of torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the Commission’s proposal on minimum standards to apply to the process of granting and withdrawing refugee status, which the Commission adopted on 20 September 2000, contains various provisions addressing the specific needs of women, such as Article 4(4), which lays down that women have the right to present a request for asylum separately from their husband, or Article 3(8), which enshrines the principle of an independent and separate interview for women when presenting a request for asylum. There is also Article 7(8), which gives women the right to have a different interviewer or interpreter if they feel inhibited about explaining the reasons for their request for asylum due to the fact that the interviewer or interpreter is male, particularly in situations of sexual abuse and, finally, Article 14(1)(c), which lays down the obligation on Member States to guarantee that staff interviewing persons in a vulnerable situation are given the necessary basic training to deal with the specific problems of these women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also intends to propose measures concerning persons with special needs in its proposal for a directive on reception conditions for asylum seekers, which will be presented in the first quarter of this year. With regard to the specific issue of gender-related persecution forming the basis of the asylum request, the Commission has already embarked on extensive consultation on this matter and we hope that in the course of this year we will be able to draw the necessary conclusions to present to Parliament and the Council a proposal for subsidiary protection that would also cover this type of situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: European chemical industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">The carbohydrates industry employs some 8 500 people. However, even with the export refund applicable in previous years, the competitive disadvantage to the European chemical industry is demonstrated by the fact that four European production units have already been closed down and six new production units have been set up by European companies in third countries, with the adverse consequences of loss of direct and indirect employment (farmers) and a loss of outlets for European agricultural products. What will the Commission do to reverse this trend?</p>

<p class="contents">The carbohydrates industry uses 1.2 million tons of starch/glucose produced from 2 million tons of cereals grown on an average of 400 000 hectares. Does the Commission realise that, by withdrawing the export refund entitlement for chemical products derived from agricultural raw materials, it has further seriously impaired the competitiveness of the European chemical industry which is already deprived of the economies of scale enjoyed by the glucose suppliers of its US counterparts as a result of the EU quota system for isoglucose and the lack of an ethanol programme in the EU?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is important, however – as transpired last year – is that on the basis of the budget discipline considerations, and other considerations, this option was not available for a while. That is point one.</p>
<p class="contents">Point two is that industry has been making distinct noises to the effect that the existing discrepancies are forming an obstacle, and so are costs incurred in processing. These aspects very much form part of the European agricultural policy. Alongside this, it cannot be denied that producers of vegetable products in the European Union are going through a rough time at the moment. In that sense, every kilogram of extra sale to the chemical industry is a welcome bonus, especially when producers can prove that they are having to produce against a higher cost price after all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would still like to ask the Commissioner, based on a real cost-price analysis for companies in Europe and elsewhere, also taking into consideration the genetically modified aspect, to again cast a critical eye over whether these regulations outside the scope of active improvement could not, in fact, be applied more forcefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, I would like to thank you for your response and the clarification as well as the distinction you have drawn between national measures on the one hand and Community measures on the other. In practice, however, I have noticed that all hell has broken loose, not just in my own country but – I assume – in other countries too. Our own regional Minister for Agriculture in the Flanders Region, Mrs Dua, has mentioned levies on meat. Others have mooted the idea of an increase in VAT, others still would like to pass the buck to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can see is a great deal of chaos and insecurity in my country. Despite the fact that, apparently, the Commission will have to be notified of such measures, there is a great deal of concern among farmers, and also amongst those in the meat-processing industry, and certainly among our local butcher shops, who, at the end of the day, will have to take the first blow. Would it indeed not be preferable to harmonise the compensation or the way in which the costs will be met, at the time that all tests need to be carried out, in advance rather than afterwards, thus ruling out any distortion of competition?

<p class="contents">I have one more comment to make on a point that was raised. Where, as the honourable Member mentioned, a Member State introduces fiscal or parafiscal measures, such as value added tax surcharges, then any such measures must, of course, be taken within the framework of existing legislation, i.e. they must be compatible with European tax directives, and any measures taken must be checked by the Commission accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is also the job and the responsibility of the individual Member States to announce regional measures.

<p class="contents">This revision incorporated the provisions of the 1989 Basle Convention on movements of hazardous wastes into Community legislation. As from 1 January 1998, the Community has therefore banned all shipments of hazardous wastes to be used for material recycling or to be deposited in countries outside the OECD. The Community therefore complies with the 1995 amendment to the Basle Convention which has not yet come into force internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation is not, however, applicable to exports of waste from the Swedish mining company, Boliden to Chile during the 1980s because Sweden was not an EU Member at that time. Furthermore, the provisions of the Basle Convention did not apply in the 1980s. In this specific case, the Commission believes that there is no Community legislation which can now make the company liable for possible environmental damage due to these waste products.

<p class="contents">More than 80 000 objections to the draft national hydrological plan have already been lodged during the consultation stage for those affected. Objections have been submitted by ecological organisations, who complain that many of the works planned under the scheme will affect areas declared as sites of Community interest by the Spanish Government, seriously threatening protected species, by trade unions and farmers' associations, who stress the negative aspects of the plan and propose a thorough revision, and by many local authorities, who have drawn attention to the inconsiderate planning of some of the diversions and their social and economic consequences for people living in the areas concerned. All these social agents have expressed the wish that the Commission should take up a position on the plan and should contact the Spanish Government urging it to correct its negative aspects. Can the Commission specify its position on the matter and say what conclusions it draws from any contacts it has had with the Spanish Government to date in relation to the plan?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

True, that proposal contained an appreciably larger number of infrastructures than the current project.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Action being taken by the Commission to increase coordination of fire protection in EU Member States</span></p>
<p class="contents">The EU's strategies for fire safety are inadequate. In particular, recent disasters such as the tunnel fire in Austria as well as earlier fires in restaurants, hotels and ships, etc. highlight the importance of better coordination of fire safety policy in the EU. Increased integration between the Member States means that common strategies need to be identified in these areas of fire safety as well.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Commission, there is to my knowledge no coordination between Directorates and no Commissioner seems to have overall responsibility for these issues. Fire safety touches on many policy areas such as tourism, environmental and consumer issues, transport networks, etc. People must be able to feel safe wherever they are in the EU.</p>

The Commission also regrets the environmental and economic damage caused by fires. This issue is particularly important in the present situation in view of the fires which occurred at Christmas in the Netherlands and in China and in which many young people died.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that it is very important to coordinate fire safety issues. Improved fire safety within the Community, especially fire prevention, is a high-priority issue in the programme of Community measures in favour of civil protection<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I can also tell you that the construction division of the Directorate-General for Enterprise has recently initiated an investigation into fire safety in the European Union in relation to buildings under construction. This investigation is aimed at improving the harmonisation of building standards so that buildings throughout the Union might fulfil the same safety requirements. The building products directive lays down essential requirements for all types of construction, including tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">In close cooperation with the Member States, the Commission is also assessing the consequences of the Council’s recommendation on fire safety in existing hotels. In this area, the Commission plans to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council during the first half of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be borne in mind that the Member States can establish their own safety requirements and that fire prevention measures mainly come within the Member States’ area of competence. Nevertheless, this is an all-embracing problem of which Community policy takes account in a variety of areas with a view to complementing measures adopted in the Member States. There may still be certain weaknesses when it comes to coordinating fire safety issues. In order to get to grips with this problem and improve coordination, my own Directorate-General’s civil protection division, together with the competent divisions in the areas of industry, health and consumer protection, set up a working party last October including representatives of different branches of the emergency services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, a good deal of progress has nonetheless been made in this area. I have no intention whatsoever of removing responsibility for these fire safety issues from national or local authorities. The principle of subsidiarity must, of course, apply in this area, just as in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask this question partly against the background of the numerous discussions I have had with firemen and their trade unions, who are quite worried. Just like the public, they are, in fact, affected more and more by cross-border factors. Firemen have to work with ever more vessels, vehicles and products from countries with which they are unfamiliar and whose levels of fire protection they are not used to. People travel more and more and naturally want to be able to feel safe irrespective of what country they are in when they take a ferry, travel through a tunnel or go to a discotheque.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I believe it is especially important not only for each Directorate to deal with these fire safety issues but also for there to be real coordination where this strategic common responsibility is concerned. I interpret the Commissioner’s statement here to the effect that there is now just such a coordinating working party as a step in that direction and, that being the case, I should just like to thank her for her answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There ought to be a way in to these issues in the Commission too. However, it is not entirely easy because we are also dealing with states of affairs which differ considerably from one country to another and in which systems are often devolved to the greatest possible degree to local level. Consequently, it can be difficult to issue recommendations and still more difficult to issue a directive which would, as it were, be applicable everywhere and clarify all these various aspects. As I said in my first speech, we are nonetheless attempting to coordinate matters as far as we can. We are also trying to see if we can obtain similar standards in all Member States and ensure that we coordinate our own efforts.</p>

What we need is a collaboration plan between all the local rescue units so that, if one country suffers an earthquake, flood or fire, the forces from all the countries which are not affected can rush to the scene and at least save lives.

You may for example be aware of the initiatives taken by the Mediterranean Environment Agency or by the Landes general council, Acquitaine region, which recently organised a meeting on how to manage the primrose willow.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Community funds, in particular the Structural Funds, and the LIFE instrument could be used to aid the management of the primrose willow in respect of Natura 2000 sites.

<p class="contents">This British regulatory body recently published a revised interim report on the progress made by BNFL. Following the February recommendations, the Commission’s services are also studying this second interim report.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission knows that, since the revised report was published in November the British regulatory body has been satisfied with the way in which BNFL has dealt, for example, with the 15 recommendations in the report specific to the demonstration plant, and that these recommendations have been closed, as they say in the nuclear industry, which means they are considered to have been complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission observes that the British regulatory body appreciates the effort and commitment displayed by BNFL with respect to its concerns and also that significant progress has been made (I am quoting directly) regarding its other recommendations in the February report. Much still remains to be done, however, since in November 2000 only 3 of the inspection team’s 28 recommendations had been formally closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the British regulatory body has recognised that many of the measures already introduced by the company will still need time to take effect fully. In the words of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, British Nuclear Fuels Limited has made a good start, but it must keep up the spirit of change while it continues to operate its plants safely.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ahern, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission appreciates the progress made and shares the inspectors’ desire to see a steady drive towards an improved safety culture at all levels of management, and, of course, within my competences, or rather in this field, my non-competences, I shall keep a watching brief on what is happening at Sellafield. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly they have not been complied with in full. We can argue about progress being swift or slow, but we have to see compliance in full.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Mrs de Palacio that you will state here today that you wish to see compliance in full with the recommendations and swiftly, because that is what I want to hear.</p>
<p class="contents">I also referred to the adverse affects on other Member States, namely the Republic of Ireland, and would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to a report published by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in December 2000, which is critical of emissions from Sellafield and their adverse effect on the Republic of Ireland.

These initiatives are intended to combat growing congestion, negative environmental effects, our over-dependence on oil and the high number of road accidents. The Commission is drawing up a set of economic measures regulating infrastructures to favour greater use of those transport modes that still have available capacity and are less harmful to the environment. The intended aim is to give a boost to new technologies and to encourage greater cooperation between transport modes.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the review of trans-European networks will be carried out in two stages. The first stage will focus on a few priority topics, emphasising the encouragement of rail freight transport. In the second stage, which is expected to begin before 2004, a more profound review of the guidelines will be conducted, looking especially at the enlargement of the Union and the environment, and the principal multi-mode transport routes will be determined.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s guidelines concerning the Structural Fund programmes for 2000-2006 recommend that priority should be given to intermodal transport.

<p class="contents">Secondly, what is intended in this White Paper – in which we shall have the opportunity to discuss all these issues in great depth, and in which problems of charging and the competitiveness of the various modes of transport, etc., will also appear – is precisely to make progress in sorting out bottlenecks, which does not mean that in some cases we shall not have to think about enhancing certain road infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also intended is a greater use of transport modes such as river or coastal transport, and what is intended, above all, is to facilitate the integration of the transport system, because in the end, sooner or later, roads always seem to come into it to guarantee the ‘door to door’ factor, which is a decisive element. This means intermodality, interconnection platforms, and also interoperability in freight systems too.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the sums for the 2000-2006 period, I frankly cannot give you the exact figures. What I can tell you is that at the moment more than 50% is already being earmarked for projects that have to do with the rail sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Supply of energy and nuclear energy</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has just adopted a Green Paper on the security of energy supply. This document gives fresh encouragement to the nuclear industry, while at the same time the Commission’s estimates suggest a progressive reduction of the proportion of energy consumption supplied by nuclear power, down from the current 15% to 6% by 2030. Civil society is rejecting the promotion of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission considering increasing the proportion of energy consumption supplied by nuclear power? If so, up to what level? How does it think it will be able to finance the development of renewable energy? How does it plan to use nuclear industry profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it not consider it advisable, and indeed necessary, to redirect the financial resources now allocated to the promotion of nuclear research, including research into nuclear fusion, into the promotion of renewable energy?</p>

Let this be quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In no document, or anywhere else, have I shown that I favour the use of nuclear energy. In the Green Paper – which you can get hold of – what emerges quite clearly is the increase in support, incentives and all kinds of backing for the use of renewable energies. A result of this is the discussion on the directive on the use of green electricity – electricity from renewable sources – or our collaboration with the Directorate-General for Competition on the question of the processing of aid to these kinds of sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Green Paper also puts forward the possibility of using some kinds of compensation or crossed subsidies from the usual or traditional energy sources – coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, or all of them together – to provide support for renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in any case, in addition to this aid for renewable energies, which I believe is essential and is put forward not just as a statement but as an objective – and remember that for the first time concrete objectives tailored to each individual Member State are being proposed, and this is being done in the green electricity directive – I consider it vital to maintain support for research in the nuclear sector, especially into matters of safety, storage and waste treatment (because burying it is not a solution), or into alternative issues such as the fusion system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is beginning to incorporate it, but renewable energy is apparently continuing to be viewed as a back-up supply rather than as the energy of the future. The facts are clear, and the view is expressed that funding is not sufficient, especially compared with levels of investment made in the past for other forms of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, nuclear energy and nuclear-based electricity, which does not produce any greenhouse gas, were widely promoted as part of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and it was basically asserted that nuclear energy could be seen as an alternative to combat the greenhouse effect. Therefore, this is why we asked the question, to see if the Commission is still on the same wavelength, in wishing to continue to develop renewable energy in both the European Union, and elsewhere in the world, and not just as a backup energy source. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our potential for renewable energies in the European Union is limited, both for physical reasons – because, apart from solar power, where we could have a greater margin, the others have clear limitations – and for economic reasons, because it is true that we have to grant aid to the renewable energies – and I have already said that I have taken concrete, positive initiatives in this respect – but even so, we have to maintain some level of competitiveness and balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Obtaining 12% of our basic energy from renewable sources seems to me to be a very ambitious target, and I am prepared to make every effort to reach this target by 2010. Having said that, I cannot deny the evidence, and the evidence is that, apart from other very serious problems such as waste, nuclear energy does not involve pollution from any emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must say that the nuclear problem is a very serious problem, but it is under control. At the moment, unfortunately, the problem of climate change is absolutely out of control. It is a problem that is out of control now, and what is more, I am afraid it will not be controllable unless we take major steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I share your concern. Not only the Green Paper on energy but also the White Paper on transport – because transport has a lot to do with this subject – take a clear line of trying to minimise the effects from a climate change point of view and from an environmental point of view, while maintaining development, growth and the quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In your response you relied heavily on the economic argument, but we have to say that both nuclear energy and coal are, in fact, heavily subsidised. As Mrs Isler Béguin said, can we see the same level of subsidies – look at the money spent on research in fusion – in renewable energies? To date we do not have level of funding either from the EU or from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two other points. Firstly, do you consider waste incineration a renewable energy, because we need clarification on that? Secondly, where we get industrial profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy, will we see a level playing field across the board?</p>
<p class="contents">I would refer you also to the fact – I have said this in other fora – that Director-General Lamoureux has made statements on nuclear energy which vastly exceed the brief of the Commission. It is for the Member States to decide whether they will build or not build nuclear power plants. Will the Commissioner disassociate herself from those comments? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, renewable energies need backing and to be given a similar level of support, at least – and I think they need even more. In other words, I fully agree with you, and I say so plainly in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, waste as such is not renewable energy. Waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy. But in the case of the appropriate incineration of waste from renewable organic components, then yes, we are in the field of renewable energy. You know that this was the subject of a debate in this Parliament and also that, in the end, a compromise was reached by which we agreed to accept a particular type of waste in certain respects and under certain conditions. But if you just say waste and that is all, then I will say no. Only waste considered in a particular way and, of course, specified and selected.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Lamoureux’s statements, he says what the Treaty states, and, of course, the decision to set up a nuclear power plant or not or to opt out is up to the Member States; it is not up to the Commission and neither is it a Community decision. It is the Member States that take their own decisions according to their own options, within the general framework, of course, which does not mean that I do not believe we should think carefully about it, because I believe Europe needs a common energy policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission action plan also contains commitments to partnerships with the ACP. The Commission action plan also contains commitments to partnerships and consultation of civil society and non-State actors.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European NGO Liaison Committee (CLONG) is concerned, our relationship with it has always been active and fruitful. In addition to contributions to NGO projects, projects that actually reach people in the developing countries, the CLONG is also financially assisted by the Commission. In accordance with its financial rules the Commission received the preliminary results of an audit of the CLONG in December 2000, which shows poor financial management within the CLONG. The Commission will draw the consequences of this audit in order to put its relationship with the CLONG on a sound basis. However, it should be mentioned that the dialogue between the Commission and the CLONG is not and will not be interrupted.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue with a number of other NGOs and other NGO umbrella organisations – there is a number of them – also will be deepened over the next year as the new organisational structure decided in May 2000 comes into place.</p>
<p class="contents">On this matter it is important to ask you not to make the mistake of thinking that accepting a special lower standard of financial management for the CLONG is an adequate way by which the Commission should demonstrate its positive attitude towards the inclusion of civil society as such. This is not the problem, the problem we are facing here is simply one of financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that NGOs have a distinct and crucial role, which is different from and not in competition with UN agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO's use of NGOs, the UN and other organisations reflects what is best in the situation. Situations change and so does the pattern of how we distribute through different partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many of the staff with experience of NGOs in the Development DG have now been transferred to the EuropAid Cooperation Office – our new implementing body. Therefore they will bring their knowledge to the new office and concentrate on how to handle the relationship better to reduce some of the problems we have had in the past with the not always very smooth dialogue between the different parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, we understand that the solution that may be presented is not in proportion to the seriousness of the irregularities that the CLONG administration may have committed, and that if a way out of the current situation is not found the NGO Liaison Committee may close.</p>

Let me here make the point that we are not at the final conclusion, we have received the report from the Auditors and we are looking at what kind of conclusions we will draw in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have indicated – and this reflects what the Auditors are saying – that there is a need to recover something around EUR 1 million. That recovery normally also leads to a stop in the funding of the recipient in question. This is normal procedure. I am faced with a situation where if I do not do this I would be acting in a manner which would in all probability be strongly criticised by the Court of Auditors and by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I still remember the very loud applause I received at my hearing in the Committee on Development and Cooperation a year and a half ago when I said that I and this Commission would take the line of a zero tolerance policy relating to mismanagement and all these problems. Everybody agrees on that and what I am doing now is following normal procedures, to the extent that we have such a thing in the Commission. But here I am on clear ground. I am aware of the problem that Mrs Sauquillo has raised and we are doing everything we can to find a solution which will allow the substance of the cooperation with the NGO world to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">But if some sort of reconstruction is necessary, this is a phase they may have to go through. For the time being I am very careful not to stipulate what the outcome ought to be because it is very much in the hands of the owners of CLONG and the many different NGOs all over Europe. But we are not turning our backs on them and we expect and hope that future cooperation will be normal and fruitful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial decision for Indonesia was signed in December 1999 and EUR 900 000 were used for the continuation of these two programmes. Two further emergency operations with a budget of EUR 1.5 million began in March 2000 because the number of displaced persons continued to rise. These operations covered the distributions of foodstuffs and first aid and the operations also ensured medical aid and a supply of drinking water to the displaced persons from the archipelago. As the conflict has reached the north of the Molucca islands and particularly the island of Halmahera the two NGOs financed by ECHO in Ambon, Medecins sans frontières, Belgium, and Action contre la faim, France, have extended their action to include displaced persons from this island. The resumption of violence in May and June last year provoked new displacements all over the archipelago. Therefore an emergency aid decision for Indonesia was signed in August 2000 for EUR 2 million. It is funding a new programme of assistance for displaced persons with a budget of EUR 600 000 which involves distribution of food and first aid. World Mission Germany is carrying out this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that the situation in the Moluccas remains a cause for humanitarian concern, a new humanitarian aid decision of 2 m was signed on 5 December 2000. The decision includes a project for the improvement of the victims' nutritional and health conditions which will be implemented by Action contre la faim, France. It also includes a project aiming at ensuring the transport of drinking water which will be carried out by the international committee of the Red Cross.</p>

<p class="contents">I visited Tanzania in March 2000 and on that occasion I also went to see camps with refugees from Burundi. The overall number of refugees in Tanzania, including those from Burundi, continues to grow. By the end of 2000 there were approximately 500 000 refugees in camps in Western Tanzania of whom around 360 000 were Burundians, 110 000 Congolese and the remainder Rwandans, Somalis and other nationalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Through ECHO the Commission funds more than one third of the total humanitarian aid available to refugees in Tanzania. In the year 2000, ECHO's budget for aid to Tanzanian refugees was EUR 26.85 m. ECHO's level of support is expected to remain substantially the same this year. The key partners in Tanzania are the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the UNHCR, UNICEF and the World Food Programme. The main objectives of the humanitarian aid are multi-sector care of refugees, feeding, education, health care for children and finally, public health, water and sanitation in the camps.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the standard of nutrition inside the camps, ECHO contributes one third of the total cost of the World Food Programme in Tanzania, which provides a balanced daily ration of 2166 calories per refugee, well over the minimum recommended by the WHO. The WFP recently alerted the international community to potential problems of supply, which would be due to delays in funding from sources other than the Commission, and daily rations were temporarily reduced to 80%. However, the rations remained adequate in view of the fact that many refugees have access to additional sources of food.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, FAO joined the international relief operation by introducing a programme to improve nutrition standards among the most vulnerable households. In collaboration with UNHCR, FAO provided 15 000 families in six of the camps with seeds and hand tools in order to plant household and community vegetable gardens. Training was given and FAO estimates that more than 50 000 people have benefited directly from the project. I have seen this programme and it is in fact so well-organised and so neat that the alternative that we can offer the refugees when they return looks much less organised. But, of course, this is what we are going to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the possible repatriation of Burundian refugees in Tanzania following the signing of the peace agreement at the Arusha Summit, the Commission is maintaining a state of readiness for this eventuality. I was myself present at the Burundi donors' conference chaired by Nelson Mandela in Paris in December, which endorsed the peace agreement. The Commission is pursuing a twin-track approach. Firstly, the current level of humanitarian assistance to refugees will be maintained while they remain in Tanzania. Secondly, should the conditions be met for their repatriation – and we are pushing everybody concerned and some who do not think they should be concerned to make this happen – then the funds allocated by ECHO to the Tanzania programme will follow the refugees back home.</p>
<p class="contents">An additional sum of EUR 25 million has been allocated by the Development DG under the Lomé Convention's Article 255 to assist UNHCR in a planned and orderly repatriation. At this stage, the preconditions for an orderly and voluntary repatriation unfortunately are not met. This was discussed in ECHO's annual strategic programming meeting with UNHCR in December when it was agreed that repatriation may only take place if all parties are convinced that the security situation inside Burundi is stabilised and sustainable. This is a major operation of ours and we want to follow it through to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We had the World Food Programme report, which said that food reserves would run out by the end of the year. There is also the need to provide for the training and education of all these refugees, even though they are in an anomalous situation in their lives, precisely so that these years should not be wasted years. Therefore, not only is it essential to give humanitarian food aid, but education programmes and health programmes are also needed so that these tragic years for this people will not be wasted years but can be the starting point for better times and especially for the permanent reconciliation of the Burundian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Peace and democratic stability are indispensable preconditions for economic and social progress. Conflict prevention is an integral part of the EU's external policy objectives. The challenge is now to address in concrete terms the root causes of conflicts and to focus on actions and the implementation of policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's contribution to conflict prevention is greatest where we can use or adapt our different instruments, especially trade and cooperation agreements, development assistance and social and environmental instruments, to tackle causes of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The last Development Council, by focusing the objective of development policy on poverty reduction, has laid the basis for addressing one of the major causes of conflict – the widening of disparities in prosperity and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again repeat that the HIPC initiative alleviating the debt of the poorest countries is also a very real contribution to conflict prevention. Globally, the low level of development assistance is, in my view, the biggest single issue that needs to be addressed if we are to be serious about conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already had numerous discussions with the Swedish Presidency and we share their concerns. It was, for example, decided to have a policy debate on conflict prevention in the General Affairs Council on 22 January. We agreed that we needed to incorporate the concept of conflict prevention in existing policy instruments to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations, the OSCE and other regional organisations and to find common approaches to cross-border phenomena of destabilisation such as the trade in narcotics, weapons or diamonds. We really need better instruments in these fields, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will present a communication on conflict prevention this spring. It is fully aware of the crucial role of development cooperation in this context. We will work closely with the Swedish Presidency to maintain conflict prevention and peacekeeping at the top of our agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder if you would look at that issue and try to ensure that we have more staff on the ground in these units.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, are you aware that they depend on annual funding which means that they cannot make long-term planning of the kind that you suggested now, so it is important that the Commission looks at these issues. Secondly, Commissioner, the whole matter of decentralisation to the delegations: will you be ensuring that in the delegations you have members of staff with expertise to deal with conflict prevention and peace building? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in the hands of Members States and this House in our struggle to get enough staff, qualified staff, to do what we are expected and supposed to do. But, I am not able to say, "yes" we will do this as Mrs Kinnock and I would like. That is not so easy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the distribution of people geographically as to their responsibilities in the early warning group and the political bodies we have created to do these things better, I do not think it can be measured only in that way. Definitely with the new structure the more cross-cutting, general handling of relations with the ACP countries for instance, the Development DG will be given more emphasis as the division of labour changes between the Development DG and the new cooperation office. This is part of our own adjustment to these priorities, and that is definitely the way I will try to improve our efficiency, even on the basis of the given resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
