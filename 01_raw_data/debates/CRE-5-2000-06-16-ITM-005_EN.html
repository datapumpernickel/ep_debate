<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grossetête (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the fact that this report is the final subject for this week’s part-session does not mean it is unimportant. Quite the contrary, we are all interested in a Citizens’ Europe, in a Europe for the citizens. It is our duty to consider the interests of the European citizen, to ensure that Community law is applied in all of the Member States and that the European Commission, the guardian of the treaties, monitors this process with the utmost vigilance.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures for 1998, in the report drawn up by the European Commission services, do not, sadly, indicate any significant improvement, and require vigilance from the outset. Few areas are spared and Parliament must pick out those which are particularly prone to difficulties: the environment, social conditions and public procurement contracts. Having said that, I am convinced that, in future, we will need to extend our vigilance to other spheres of activity. The European Parliament must also reiterate its request for information concerning the application of international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the Member States are affected to a greater or lesser degree by the problems of applying Community law. This is why I wanted to stress just how important it is that they behave in an exemplary manner in the period prior to several successive enlargements. How can we demand that those countries wanting to join the European Union apply Community laws if Member States are themselves unable to respect them?</p>
<p class="contents">If additional information is necessary, this is also in the interests of the citizen, who is becoming increasingly involved in the process of monitoring Community law. This is where the whole question of the infringement procedure comes in. The European Commission should not advocate more selectivity in dealing with cases which may give rise to an infringement procedure, a proposal according to which the Commission could abstain from intervening in cases of limited importance, such as, for example, the mutual recognition of qualifications. We must protest most strongly against such a move, which could not be justified on the grounds of cost and effectiveness. In doing so, the European Commission would find itself turning away from its role as guardian of the Treaties and would deny European citizens access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As for methods, I think they can be improved. As has been indicated several times by the European Ombudsman, it is important to safeguard the rights of individuals through improved confidentiality, better access to documents and justification of the European Commission’s decisions on classification. In the same vein, more data should be obtained on Member States’ responsibility for damages suffered by private individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody would think of doubting the importance of petitions, which play a significant part in signalling that, in some instances, Community law has not been applied in Member States. In this spirit, we are urging that special publicity be given to all complaints in order that any action taken is made more obvious. Bearing in mind the approach that has been adopted, however, which centres above all on defending the working methods of the Committee on Petitions, I do not wish to support Amendment No 2.</p>
<p class="contents">The attention paid to the CELEX and EUR-LEX databases, that is to say improved access and ongoing optimisation is, I believe, beneficial to the citizen. Consolidated documents should be associated with some indication of the successive amendments introduced, as required by Amendment No 1. I therefore support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the problem of the preliminary question. I do not believe that it needs to be called into doubt in principle, but we can look into its forms. When such questions are badly drawn up, the effect can run counter to the aim of legal clarification. I therefore suggest that the Court of Justice reconsider the way this procedure works. Moreover, I believe that, in order to clarify the text of Recital G, which reads: “whereas it is primarily national courts that must apply Community law”, it would be preferable to state “control the application of Community law”.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also, finally, the matter of relations with public administrations which are having to come to grips with new Community standards. The current state of affairs in Europe’s construction tends to emphasise the principle of subsidiarity. In consideration of this key principle, I am opposed to Amendment No 3. I do not consider creating a European administrative law to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the fact remains that the aim of a control system is to penalise non-application of the law. With this in mind, I want to stress the importance of the procedure outlined in Article 228(2), of the Treaty. This is a new procedure, and is certainly a deterrent in effect, and the Commission should be less reluctant to consider it in future. By voting in favour of this resolution, we will be sending out a positive signal, from a European Parliament which is in tune with the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figures given by the rapporteur have only compounded our concerns as they are a clear reflection of Member States’ failure to apply Community law and this report actually incorporates proposals that would force them to do so. The fact that 1101 letters of formal notice, 675 reasoned opinions and 123 referrals have been presented to the Court of Justice clearly highlight the difficulties inherent in applying European Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to chiefly focus on the proposal put forward by the Committee on Petitions that incorporates amendments signed by all of the groups in the committee. I should also like to point out, as a result of those gremlins which sometimes appear in this House, that the Committee on Petitions’ conclusions were not incorporated in the rapporteur’s report. I have the distinct impression that the Committee on Petitions is considered the poor sister of Parliament and, in fact, at the end of the previous legislature its very future was in doubt. However, it is in my view one of the most important committees in Parliament, as it has direct and clearly defined relations with the citizens of Europe and the ability to deal with issues, such as concerns for the environment. The rapporteur points out that more than 25% of the petitions lodged concern environmental problems, freedom of movement, fundamental freedoms and the internal market, issues that, in my view, are central to the European Constitution. What is more, in view of the rising number of incoming petitions every year they also highlight citizens’ desire to see Community law complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">At times it appears that citizens’ groups, residents’ associations and other types of association show greater concern with regard to the application of Community law than the national public authorities themselves. This is particularly true of environmental issues, something I have personal experience of as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. Proof of this lies in the petitions we handle on a daily basis in the Committee on Petitions. This is why I urge you to approve the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Petitions that are no more and no less than a clear reflection of the Committee on Petitions’ concern regarding the procedures used for handling citizens’ complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">There are considerable delays – often one, two or even three years – between the Committee on Petitions’ or the European Commission’s final decision on a matter following the initial complaint. The amendments tabled call for procedures to be simplified, as failure to do so would seriously undermine citizens’ confidence in the effectiveness of the European institutions. Among other things, the amendments call for a certain degree of harmonisation in European administrative law so that all citizens of the Union receive equal treatment. </p>
<p class="contents">Much more could be said, Mr President, about the nature and importance of the Committee on Petitions, but as time is short, I would simply urge members to agree to vote in favour of these amendments today, as they represent the opinion of the Committee on Petitions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One great Italian thinker maintains that a society is commonly perceived as such only insofar as it succeeds in establishing rules for itself which are respected by its members. Certainly, the European Community used to be an institutional model with a remarkable history and the Union is so today; within this Community we have established rules for ourselves – and the Member States and the citizens respect them – but Parliament must not shirk its lawful duty to implement and ensure the implementation of the rules of Community law. Moreover, it must draw fresh strength, fresh nourishment, from its tasks. Although we have come a long way and we are making every effort now, I feel that we still have a long way to go. It is our duty to take on board the fact that there is still a great deal to do in the internal market in terms of standardisation, but also and above all, we must realise that there are a great many gaps in the development of the European legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good to know that the rate of transposition of Community directives into Member States’ legislation stands at 95%, but this is not enough if the failure to apply Community law correctly is the result of bad practice on the part of administrations rather than the failure to assimilate directives. An effective intervention to deal with the national administrations is therefore, in my opinion, necessary, as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has stressed. This need is all the greater in that those who are in contact with the law and justice are often unfamiliar with the rules of Community law. </p>
<p class="contents">As the report requests, it is therefore appropriate for candidates to the magistracy and forensic science professions to pay particular attention to the rules which we are developing. I tabled some amendments to Mrs Grossetête’s excellent report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, prompted by the concern that the legal protection of the citizens we represent is given insufficient recognition and enforcement in the individual countries. Petitions to the Commission and the European Parliament in this context should give us not only food for thought, but also cause for concern. The fact that some national courts hardly ever put preliminary questions to the Court of Justice under Article 234 of the Treaty is a further cause for concern, and the representatives of the Commission should instruct their departments to investigate the reasons for this situation. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, we must not underestimate the economic and practical difficulties encountered by the citizens in gaining access to Community case law. It may be that we need to adopt a legislative initiative as soon as possible in order to facilitate access to case law in economic terms, perhaps by establishing a support fund.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, has produced an extremely balanced report containing a series of accurate observations which deserve special attention. The two reports quite rightly divide the subject of the application of Community law into three dimensions: the non-transposition of Community law and the incompatibility of transposition measures with the letter of Community law and application methods.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as non-application is concerned, there are still serious delays in certain sectors, including the social sector, to which, I am sorry to see, the Commission’s report only devotes a few lines, despite the fact that the issues in question relate to social cohesion. There are numerous reasons for non-transposition and they need to be studied. Also, it is time that we considered political methods for reducing delays. For example, what if each country were to appoint a uniform body at the highest political level which would be responsible, vis-à-vis the European Union, for transposing Community law correctly and on time?</p>
<p class="contents">What if each country which took over the presidency had to make a prompt, public declaration of its country's degree of compliance with Community law, given that it does not make sense for a country to be responsible for administering political matters when it has not honoured its own commitments? It might also be useful if the state of compliance of each country were publicly announced before each summit. Negligence in transposing Community law in the past did not have the same repercussions as it has on a single economic area in which the idea of not having a uniform legal Community order at the same moment in time is inconceivable</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the method of applying Community law is concerned, this issue relates mainly to the legislative system, both national and Community, and to the appointment of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman. The two basic problems relating to the legislative system are: first, often unjustified recourse to the procedure for obtaining preliminary rulings from the European Court and, as Mr Álvarez has mentioned, poorly prepared references and, secondly, the failure to take such recourse on crucial issues. Despite appearing different, both have the same root cause, which is the national judges' lack of familiarity with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">A general campaign is needed here. We need to propose to the Member States that all judges should gradually be trained and that this should be the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for the promotion of older judges to more senior positions and for the admission of newcomers to the bench.</p>
<p class="contents">The present Grotius and Falcone programmes have become out-dated as a result of developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a brief word about where the Committee on Petitions can play an important part in improving the degree of application of Community law. This committee forms the interface between the European citizen, the European Parliament and the Commission. We need to upgrade this committee if we are to uncover omissions in the practical application of Community law. I am in favour of Mr Álvarez's proposals, which really do form the starting point for European administrative Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly want to stress a clause which she mentioned in her own speech: recital (e) says that on the eve of several successive enlargements the conduct of the current Member States of the Union in the application of Community law must be exemplary. And so indeed it must. Alas, we know that it is not so in all cases. I have on more than one occasion in this House referred, as others have done, to the shocking case of the foreign language lecturers in Italy who first received a judgment in their favour eleven years ago. The law of Italy has not yet been brought into conformity with it, to satisfy their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are tested by our will in favour of the individual, the citizen, seeking their rights under Community law. No rights are more important than those against discrimination and those in favour of freedom of movement. If we do not satisfy these we let ourselves down in the face of our own aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received disturbing correspondence this week from a number of sources in Germany, suggesting that a similar problem may be building up concerning self-employed foreign language teachers working there, where laws are being applied retrospectively for the convenience for the state with apparent injustice to the teachers. I shall be following that up and we may have to look into it again. I cite these two exemplary cases simply to stress the importance of Mrs Grossetête's report and to thank her personally for her own intervention in the former case which I am sure will move it forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise for the fact that I cannot stay to the end of this debate owing to exigencies of transport between here and Edinburgh, but I am delighted to have had the chance of participating so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European citizens have used this last resort as a way of expressing their anger and indignation at the disruption and even destruction of their daily way of life, foisted on them by bureaucrats for a purpose that sometimes escapes us and for stakes that do not justify it.</p>
<p class="contents">While this report should have offered us an opportunity, as elected Members, to assess the many texts on which we are voting, and to learn from them for the future, we are limiting ourselves to a control/sanction approach. This type of constraining, over-regulated Europe is certainly not the one our respective fellow citizens want.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which this report has been adopted is appalling. The rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has demonstrated absolute scorn for the Committee on Petitions by not even seeing fit to put its conclusions to the vote. Yesterday, the plenary displayed a similar contempt when it ignored the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee regarding the Maaten report. I greatly fear that the trend will spread and the Commission will not see the text, on which we in this half-empty House are about to vote, as very much more important.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than unnecessary amendments, I should like a response to the following question. The 1998 figures show that reasoned opinions have doubled in volume, cases of non-conformity or poor application, revealed automatically, have gone up by over 50%, complaints by 18% and letters of formal notice by 12%. This is not, at this stage, evidence of effective control, but rather of the existence of a profusion of texts which, in the hands of the judges, leave our national assemblies, which are expressing the popular will both legitimately and democratically, under threat of condemnations as well as of penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Do the Commission and the rapporteur not think that it would be a good thing to reduce the number of texts and, above all, to modify those which quite clearly raise crucial political, legal and practical questions that do not appear to be so obvious and acute when they are framed, or would they prefer to carry on sanctioning our States and turning our fellow citizens into the real victims? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to comment on the issue of a community based on law and one based on values. In my view, the community based on law and the community based on values do not stand in contradiction to one other, rather they are interdependent. Anyone who breaks the law or perverts the course of justice violates certain values. And anyone who violates these values can be judged and condemned under the law. You will understand that, in this context, what I am saying from the Austrian point of view is that, in their actions towards Austria, the 14 Member States of the European Union have infringed EU law, international law and the UN Charter, that they have defied the spirit of the European founding fathers and thus damaged the community of values. And I therefore call upon you to repair that damage.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. On 1 February 2000, the Commission issued a statement on this matter saying that it would continue to fulfil its duty as guardian of the Treaties. And with regard to Austria it said that, in this context, the Commission, in close contact with the governments of the Member States, would closely monitor the situation, maintaining its working relations with the Austrian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that, as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission has been closely monitoring the situation since 1 February 2000 and, to this day, it has not found any grounds for criticism, which makes it clear that neither the community based on law nor that based on values is being violated in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment is that yesterday I made a mistake! I should like to say this in conclusion. I criticised my Socialist colleagues from Austria for the inconsistent way in which they voted, and I insinuated that at the end they had abstained from the vote on the Feira resolution. That is wrong; they voted in favour. This does not in any way change my critical attitude towards the double standards of the Austrian Social Democratic movement, which were also plain to see yesterday in the way its Members voted. But I must admit my mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not hurt the 14 either if, in Feira, they were to publicly retract the statement they made on 31 January 2000, contrary to the law, about one Member State, and if they were to rectify this mistake.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur is absolutely right, Mr President, to say that these amendments, though very interesting, are not relevant in this case. Firstly, everyone is aware how hard I have fought to establish genuine administrative law in this area, however, the report centres on a different issue. The same can be said in relation to the Committee on Petitions’ other amendment that refers to an interinstitutional agreement and appeals to the Council and the Commission for greater cooperation. We shall have to vote on these amendments, but in another report.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Grossetête’s report, Mr President, the fact that I have only tabled one amendment – and even that was in conjunction with Mrs Grossetête herself – is proof of my appreciation of her work and the spirit in which it was carried out. Those of you who know me will be only too aware of the fact that, if I disagree with a text, particularly one that is close to my heart and to which I attach great importance, I never hold back when it comes to amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue that I hope Mrs Grossetête will raise during the vote – I unfortunately cannot attend, which is why I am making a point of it here – and that is the mistake in recital G. It should state that monitoring the application of Community law is first and foremost the responsibility of the courts. As regards the other issues, this report is, in my view, thorough, comprehensive and of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a few points in relation to Mrs Grossetête’s report. We should perhaps consider broadening its scope, not only to encompass Annex IV and the development of Article 65, but also possibly take it further and perhaps consider –as part of the creation of the Europe of the Citizens – setting up communication channels to enable citizens to discuss issues that affect them in relation to Community law and even the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year, Commissioner, we should like to see a more balanced and exhaustive report drawn up. As Mrs Grossetête herself pointed out, this report is very balanced and exhaustive in some areas but not in others.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall message put forward is that Community law must be applied properly; our Community is a Legal Community; there will either be a European rule of law or not; and monitoring compliance with Community law must be considered a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should briefly like to highlight the importance of the infringement procedure and draw people’s attention, as others have before me, to this reform which is desirable and on which we all agree. We need to improve the way in which the infringement procedure operates, but do so in a way that does not prevent citizens in the slightest from fully exercising their right to directly contact the Commission which, at the end of the day, is what brings them closer to it. As we so often speak about bringing citizens closer to the institutions, this is surely one of the ways to achieve this aim.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with her: there is nothing more important that we could devote time to discussing in this Parliament. Preceding the downfall of the Roman Empire it was customary to take out the imperial decree, unroll the great scroll of purple and gold, read it, have it copied and distribute it – and nobody took the slightest notice of it. There is no surer way to bring about the downfall and disintegration of this Union than to make laws that Member States do not ensure are then observed.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that did not come up in the discussion was the greater use that could be made of the proceedings in this House, particularly Question Time, to bring to the attention of the Commission and exchange views with them on grievances that arise throughout the Union. These are increasingly being brought to the attention of Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the early days I lived in a border area where the right of freedom of movement of goods and services was not being observed and I found I could get a lot of satisfaction by raising questions directly with the Commission. In those days Parliament did not have the same power or prestige that it has today. So instead of reducing working time in this House we should devote a little more time to underlining the failures of the European Union to implement its decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some areas that people, particularly in business, are well-familiar with, such as the single market. But there are other areas where there is a lot of confusion. I was at a conference last week. Someone pointed out the fact that we need 100 million migrant workers in this Union over the next 25 years if we are to maintain economic growth and meet our social obligations. If that happens, there will be a lot of movement of people. If, from the very beginning, the European Union and the Member States make it clear that these people have equal rights, that the conditions on which they are admitted are common conditions and that they are free to move within the Union after they enter, then citizens would be half-way towards accepting the situation and we could forestall a lot of the difficulties with migrants which are already emerging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, the report on monitoring the application of Community law that has today been put before you, is the sixteenth report of its kind. In this way, the demand made by Parliament in its resolution of 9 February 1983, has been fulfilled. In this report, the Commission makes its annual assessment of the monitoring of the application of Community law, which is one of its essential tasks.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission constantly endeavours to improve the speed and efficiency, not to mention the transparency, of its working methods in this sphere. The report compiled by Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for which I would like to offer my sincere thanks, contains numerous findings in this respect and makes various recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to highlight the salient points. Firstly, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to say how much I appreciate the fact that the recently introduced reforms in connection with the treatment of complaints submitted by citizens were so well-received by Parliament. In addition, the Commission noted, to its satisfaction, that emphatic reference is made in this report to the fact that its services are committed to improving training in Community law among members of the legal profession in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the Commission is called upon in the report to redouble its efforts in respect of the transparency of investigations into infringement cases. I can assure you that these efforts will be pursued and intensified wherever possible, which will mean taking account of the Treaty provisions and, in some cases, the restrictions deriving from them, especially with regard to confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as I see it, the steadily increasing number of press reports published by the Commission (there were 334 in 1998) and the fact that each press report relates to more than one issue, would indicate that the Commission is committed to a form of transparency that goes much further than a complainant’s natural, fundamental desire for information on the further treatment of his or her complaint. It has now become quite routine for a press report to be published when the Commission decides to send a reasoned opinion to a Member State or to involve the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission’s recent initiatives in the sphere of information for the citizen, such as ‘Europe direct’ also guarantee enhanced transparency. The services of the Commission devote special attention to compliance with confidentiality requirements in their dealings with complainants. Confidentiality with respect to the complainant’s identity is always the guiding principle, unless they expressly ask for their name to be disclosed.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I can assure you that the Commission has no intention whatsoever of attaching less importance to the treatment of the complaints submitted to the Commission. I want to stress this because certain Members of the House here today have asked me to address this point. It is quite clear from the sixteenth report that these complaints are indispensable to the services of the Commission in their investigations into breaches of Community law. The Commission’s aims are two-fold here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it wants to cut down the amount of time taken to examine the dossiers, which is still too long in some cases. Secondly, it wants to make national jurisprudence more accessible to European citizens, since this is the only form of jurisprudence that can redress the damage sustained by the injured party.</p>
<p class="contents">This highlights the significance of the measures recently communicated by the Commission to Parliament as part of the overview of the demands relating to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. The Commission is endeavouring to nip breaches of Community law in the bud and is therefore constantly updating its procedures pertaining to the monitoring of the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Various types of measure could help to achieve this goal. First and foremost, we need to improve the procedure in respect of the prejudicial issue laid down pursuant to Article 234 of the EC Treaty. The Commission has already submitted concrete proposals in this connection, as part of its contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference. By amending Article 234 of the aforementioned Treaty, the intention is to achieve the following.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to make the national judges accountable for their actions when they are called upon to enforce Community law. Secondly, to request national courts that do not deliver the final decision to provide reasoned grounds as to why they doubt the interpretation of Community law. Thirdly, to compel each and every national court to involve the Court of Justice when they are minded not to apply a piece of Community legislation on account of its putative invalidity.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also aiming for more effective implementation of Community law in the Member States by making the monitoring of the transposition measures pertaining to the Community directives more systematic.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when the channels of communication between the services of the Commission and the national authorities, are improved they will be better placed to trace breaches of Community law at as early a stage as possible and to call a halt to them.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Two final comments. As far as the possibility of taking account of the application of the second and third pillars in the report is concerned, I would reiterate that we have no instrument at our disposal, within the framework of these pillars, that bears comparison with the infringement procedures laid down in Article 226 of the EC Treaty. Breaches of Community law pertaining to international agreements fall within the scope of the annual report.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission is delighted at the support it is receiving from Parliament in the exercise of this complex task, i.e. monitoring the application of Community law. Whilst having due regard for the Treaties, the Commission will reflect on any improvements that need to be made, as part of an ongoing process of analysis and improvement in respect of the infringement procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of respect for my colleagues, in my previous intervention I made reference to what I termed the ‘gremlins’ that sometimes appear in Parliament, but it is not these poor gremlins’ fault. Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi made it very clear that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens’ Rights had no intention of incorporating the Committee on Petitions’ conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Proof that these conclusions were unanimously adopted lies in the fact that they were signed by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, another member of the Committee on Petitions from the European People’s Party, two members of the Socialist Group and I myself as draftsman of the opinion. I am of the view that it is imperative for any report on the application of Community law to incorporate the Committee on Petitions’ conclusions, as this committee plays such a key role in ensuring Member States apply Community law. This is why I urge you to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 2 and 3.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that the basic points made by the Committee on Petitions have already been included in the text of the report I drew up. The reason why we do not agree with your amendments, as Mrs Palacio has explained, is because this is not the place to include them. If you look at the report in detail, you will find that the basic elements of your conclusions have been incorporated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is paragraph 11, which invites the Commission, and I quote,: “to be less timid in the use of the periodic penalty payment procedure in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 228(2) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This Article stipulates that the Court of Justice may, as it sees fit, impose penalties or fines, sometimes very stiff ones, on a Member State that, for whatever reason, fails to apply Community law. We feel, however, that the legal problem is not that simple, and that inflicting such penalties on Member States is excessive. In fact, there may be totally legitimate contradictions between Community law and national law. For example, a contradiction which may appear following a qualified majority vote in Council – and there are an increasing number of such votes – or a contradiction which may appear between a national constitution and Community law, or even a contradiction which may appear between Community law and a law which has been voted for after due consideration by the population of a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">These contradictions are very serious, they are still unresolved and this is why we see the existence of Article 228, which was brought in by the Maastricht Treaty, as wholly contestable. I should like in particular to point out that France is now liable to incur severe penalties through the 1998 law, concerning, for example, hunting seasons which contradict Community law, the embargo on British beef and the conflict which, Mr President, is in the process of arising, relating to the patenting of human genes which authorises a European directive that contradicts French law. This is why we absolutely cannot accept this report. It is a question of respecting national sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In doing so, the European Parliament sends a positive signal to Europe’s citizens, who have the right to expect a high level of protection through Community law. This Assembly has also demonstrated its vigilance faced with the difficulties of application that exist in several Member States and in many spheres of activity. It has remembered the importance of the infringement procedure, which must not become subject to opportune reform by the Commission. It has highlighted the position of the preliminary question in the European system and the need to step up training in Community law within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">While nobody would deny the importance of petitions, I did not wish to go along with the amendments tabled by the members of the Committee on Petitions, in particular the request to set up a ‘European administrative law’. Account must be taken of the current state of progress in the construction of Europe and of the principle of subsidiarity. I should stress, however, that the intention is to ask the Commission to intensify its relations with national administrations when there is a problem, in order that it can be resolved beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken as a whole, the resolution adopted serves to improve transparency and effectiveness, which is to the benefit of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
