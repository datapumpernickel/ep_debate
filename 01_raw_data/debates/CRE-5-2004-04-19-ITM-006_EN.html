<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, just a year ago this Parliament adopted its resolution on the Commission's new consumer policy strategy for the next five years. We are discussing today three key proposals within the context of that strategy. I am particularly pleased that Parliament has decided to discuss them jointly, as all three pursue the objective of boosting consumer confidence in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer purchases represent close to 60% of the EU's GDP. A loss of consumer confidence – even by a small amount – can have significant repercussions for our economy and collective wealth. Last month, at the spring European Council, the Heads of State and Government took stock of our pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda, which aims to boost the competitiveness of our economy. It would be no exaggeration to say that there is definitely room for improvement in this respect. Consumer confidence is good for business and would contribute to boosting our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has come a long way in eliminating barriers in the single market. In tearing down regulatory barriers we must, however, realise that consumers – the demand side of the market – are also confronted with barriers, namely confidence barriers. Not addressing these confidence barriers would not only be irresponsible but also very damaging to the interests of consumers and businesses alike. It would also put a heavy burden on our ability to meet our competitiveness objectives set out in the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals we are discussing today will allow us to maximise the benefits of the single market for consumers. I would like to thank the three rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their hard work on these proposals, as well as the rapporteurs from the committees providing opinions for their time and effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn first to the proposed regulation on enforcement cooperation. It addresses what has always been the weak point in consumer protection: the effective application of the law. In cross-border cases, problems increase because national enforcement mechanisms are not designed to deal with such cases. Rogue traders who seek to cheat consumers have spotted this and are more prevalent in cross-border cases than in domestic ones, targeting consumers across borders through the post, by e-mail or via websites. To deal with this, the proposed regulation sets up a network of public enforcement authorities, with at least one in each Member State. The effect of the proposal will be that national authorities can cooperate quickly and effectively in tracking down rogue traders and stop them from harming consumers and legitimate businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation will send a strong message to European citizens, telling them that the EU is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that they can have greater confidence in shopping throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Gebhardt and colleagues who worked with her towards a compromise agreement with the Council allowing for the adoption of the proposal in a single reading. The compromise that was negotiated between the institutions ensures that enforcement authorities will at last have the necessary tools at their disposal genuinely to cooperate in cross-border cases. At the same time, it respects the various traditions that exist among the different Member States, with some relying more on public enforcement and others relying more on private actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware and indeed concerned that some of you would prefer the opinion of the lead committee, which is expressed in Amendment No 29, over the compromise solution contained in Amendment No 76, which has been worked out with the Council. Pursuing this approach risks leading to prolonged discussions with the Council and to a second reading, further delaying the creation of an effective enforcement mechanism capable of dealing with rogue traders.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no reason why either our businesses or our consumers would in any way benefit from such a delay. The amendments tabled and supported by some in no way enhance the effectiveness of the mechanism, neither do they present a meaningful contribution to safeguarding established national mechanisms and traditions. I therefore urge all Members to stick to the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the last legislative part-session of this Parliament before the elections. It is therefore also your final opportunity to ensure that when you have to inform your voters about precisely what you have done to further consumer interests and the enforcement of law, you have a tangible example to show them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal on the table today is the proposed directive on consumer credit. There is broad agreement that a new directive on consumer credit is both necessary and desirable. The market and the products have evolved considerably since the mid-1980s and the existing directive is no longer adapted to new developments in the area of credit. This new directive is necessary to allow the emergence of a real single market in consumer credit. It is desirable in order to achieve a high level of consumer protection in line with the consumer policy action plan endorsed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why I consider a full harmonisation approach the only means to really create a level playing field for lenders throughout the EU. Many of you have called, and will call, for minimum harmonisation, allowing Member States to top up the rules at national level. This would, however, mean maintaining differences between national legislations. It will continue to ensure that the credit market remains a domestic and local market, depriving consumers of all the advantages a single credit market could offer them. It would not improve legal certainty for creditors and consumers contracting across borders. It would not help to develop a genuine single market in consumer credit. The full harmonisation approach will not lead to a lowering of consumer protection standards, as we have rightly chosen a high common level of protection as the starting point. Moreover, I would stress that the harmonisation applies to only those areas actually covered by the directive. In areas that fall outside the scope of the directive, Member States remain free to maintain their own national provisions. Full harmonisation will improve the overall level of consumer protection in the EU and facilitate the provision of cross-border credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, I come to the framework directive on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices. This proposal aims to put in place a high common level of consumer protection against unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices EU wide. In doing so, it will stimulate consumer confidence and ensure that rogue practices can be addressed wherever in the EU they arise. Just as importantly, it will reduce the barriers that prevent legitimate businesses from making the most of the internal market and reaching new consumers. Both businesses and consumers will benefit from the security of having one set of rules rather than 15 or, from 1 May, 25. Both business and consumers will therefore be better placed to take advantage of the enlarged internal market. This in turn will have a positive effect on the competitiveness of the EU economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I will leave it at that for the time being and look forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the Member States have precautions in place to protect consumers, whether this is done using public authorities such as the UK’s Office of Fair Trading or France’s <span class="italic">Direction générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes</span>, or by such bodies as the Dutch <span class="italic">Consumentenbond</span> or the <span class="italic">Zentrale zur Bekämpfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs </span>in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">All of them help if, for example, a letter lands on your doormat telling you that you have won a prize in a lottery, and that all you have to do to get it is to sign and post the form, so you do and off it goes. A week later, you get goods you have not ordered, which you are told you have to pay for. Alternatively, you fall for one of the slimming courses that are on offer – particularly frequently in young people’s magazines in recent times – the effectiveness of which is much exaggerated and whose side-effects are glossed over. Perhaps you have been enticed by an offer that has turned out to involve ‘modem jacking’, in which a website offers you the chance to download music free of charge, you accept the offer, and, in the course of the process, you, the customer, without being aware of it, are cut off from your usual Internet Service Provider and attached to another one that is much more expensive. Only later do you get the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">In most cases of fraud, the national authorities can provide help. It is something like 20% of cases that matters become problematic, when the only known address is often a PO Box in a foreign country. In such situations, good advice soon becomes invaluable.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft piece of legislation is of great importance in terms of dealing with cases such as these. Legislation is also urgently needed, for problems are piling up, and we should not leave the public to their own devices. That is why, as your rapporteur, I acceded to the wish of the Irish Presidency of the Council that the legislation should be adopted, if at all possible, in only one reading. What is on the table is what has emerged from negotiations. I also want to put on the record my thanks to the Commission for its active help in achieving this result.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation is primarily concerned with mutual assistance in enforcing consumers’ rights, for which every Member State is to set up a public office to function as the point of contact for the authorities in other Member States, although I wish to stress that no Member State will be obliged to set up a new authority. It is for the Member States to decide how to allocate the functions described in this Regulation to existing authorities. This is not about creating bureaucracy, but about successfully putting a stop to the fraudulent schemes of a few rogue traders, who use cross-border businesses as a front.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, public agencies can, by mutual agreement, delegate the handling of cases to non-governmental organisations, and this is the traditional practice in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. I am working on the assumption that, in these states the norm will be for tasks to be handed over to time-tested bodies such as consumers’ associations or business self-regulators. On that, I believe, depends my recommendation, as rapporteur, to my fellow-Members that they should vote to accept this compromise text. The only exceptions I can envisage are where statutory bodies have to exchange particularly sensitive data, but we have made definite arrangements for that in this document.</p>
<p class="contents">By agreeing to this draft legislation, we can redeem a pledge given by all of us as MEPs, our pledge that we would commit ourselves to dealing with the public’s concerns. I hope that, tomorrow, we will do so with a resounding yes.</p>

We were, unfortunately, obliged to consider a Commission proposal that was not entirely consistently thought through, that was sloppily worded and had not taken account, above all, of the serious consequences it would have for consumers, for example on their access to credit. We in the committee therefore had to propose extensive changes to this directive, achieving the sad record of 650 amendments to what have to date been 38 articles, but your concentrated collaboration means that it has now been possible to assemble all this into a genuinely consistent whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must I let this opportunity go by without very warmly thanking Parliament’s Bureau and the groups’ secretariat, not to mention my own staff, for the endless hours they devoted to this project.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell the House that what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to do by means of this proposal is to send out three signals. One carries the message that the European internal market needs the best possible consumer protection. We will achieve this if we combine the European Union’s minimum standards with the legislation of individual states, but if, on the other hand, we were to take the approach of harmonising everything or as much as possible, that would amount to only the minimum of protection for the consumer. This is where I want to express my disagreement with what Commissioner Byrne had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that I get the impression that what matters most of all to the Commission is that consumer law in this area should be completely centralised, with the European Union alone being entitled to do anything that has to do with consumer protection. That would not, however, be objectively reasonable, as the national markets still differ to a large extent, and it is there that there must be a rapid and flexible response when improper business practices crop up.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are sending the message that financial markets need to be opened up to individual consumers too. We want the standards of protection not only to enhance public confidence in <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce and in buying by mail order, but also to encourage the public to seek out offers throughout the internal market in order, eventually, to find credit on favourable terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are signalling our opposition to over-regulation and bureaucracy, for there is, quite simply, no sense in deluging ordinary customers – responsible adults though they may be – with a flood of information that they cannot read, let alone understand; hence our proposal for clear technical information that will provide consumers with the key facts on their loans at a glance.</p>
<p class="contents">We also made it our concern to maintain access to credit facilities particularly for the man and woman in the street and for the vulnerable members of society. It is these sectors of the population who need short-term loans simply to stay on top of day-to-day life. The end result of the Commission proposal would have been that the only people who could get credit would be those who had no need of it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two more specific points I would like to address briefly, and these are still subject to discussion between the groups. The first has to do with the entitlement to early repayment. One position on this is that this should generally be permitted, and without any additional costs being incurred, whilst the other is that consumers should be allowed to choose between fixed-term loans and those capable of being repaid early. In view of the fact that we have still not yet come to an agreement on this, let me draw still closer to the Group of the Party of European Socialists; you will have seen that I have already tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment No 173, in which I propose that, where loans are taken out for a period of over three years, it should be possible to repay them at any time. I would now like to add to that by combining it with Amendment No 96 as recommended by the committee, whose effect is to bring about a commensurate reduction in costs in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there are some points from today’s debate that I wanted to mention, let me bring this speech to a close. I see this package of reports – Mrs Gebhardt’s, Mrs Ghilardotti’s, and my own – as the culmination and conclusion of our legislative work in the field of consumer law. We have always managed to discharge our responsibilities in a state of tension between the demands of the internal market and those of consumer protection, and what we have put before you I see as being a single piece of mature legislation. Whatever our differences about the details, then, I hope that they will receive the general support of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghilardotti (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive concerning unfair commercial practices takes over a large part of the Green Paper on consumer protection, referred to by the Commissioner in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons underlying the directive, which is designed to achieve higher consumer protection, are of an economic nature, and therefore relate to the completion and smooth operation of the internal market. In order for these general economic goals to be achieved, it is necessary to have a consumer protection policy to create European consumer confidence and to give a fresh impetus to international and European commercial transactions. The benefit of economic growth in the internal market ought to translate into both higher profits for businesses and higher protection and financial benefits for consumers. Through a joint policy for consumers and the harmonisation of the internal market it will also be possible to achieve price convergence. Conversely, unfair commercial practices lead to irrational financial behaviour in consumers, create distortions of competition and place barriers in the way of the proper functioning of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I endorse the Commission's approach, which is based on harmonisation, on the principle of mutual recognition of the country of origin, on a general prohibition on unfair commercial practices, on the identifying of specific criteria and examples and on the fact that the scope of application is limited to a framework directive based on business-consumer relations. The creation of a European legislative framework covering unfair commercial practices based on an appropriate level of harmonisation and aimed at clear and effective protection of consumers within the European Union will result in enhanced consumer confidence, an increase in international trade and will allow businesses to compete in a situation of legal clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">While endorsing the basic approach and the main objectives of the directive, Parliament is nevertheless tabling a raft of amendments which, in our opinion, make a series of definitions and options clearer and unequivocal. In this regard, we have tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis, that is, a proposal to include, in addition to the legal basis proposed by the Commission in relation to the internal market, a legal basis based on Article 153 concerning consumer protection, so that we can reconcile the objective of harmonisation and mutual recognition of the internal market with the possibility for the Member States to maintain legislation which goes further to protect consumers. In this way, I believe that we can respond to the fears of those who think that greater harmonisation could lead to downward levelling of consumer protection or entail a step backwards with regard to existing legislation in many Member States. We also feel that it is important – with regard to the definition of consumers – to refer to a particular group of consumers, specifically vulnerable consumers who, as a result of various factors such as age, physical or mental abilities, their level of literacy or disability, need greater protection. Again with reference to Article 2, in relation to the definitions, it is important to amend the definition of professional diligence and I will retable an amendment in plenary in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, we support the Commission’s approach to the regulation of misleading and aggressive practices but we stress, though, that the information which consumers must receive about unfair commercial practices and codes of conduct is an essential element. Similarly we also think, in relation to codes of conduct, that the distinction between national and Community codes is slightly artificial, and we therefore point out the need to provide for appropriate, efficient mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the codes.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point, which concerns the codes of conduct as a method of regulating and resolving disputes between businesses and consumers, is arbitration, which cannot and should not replace or prevent recourse to administrative bodies, but which could play an important part.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as my fellow Members and Commissioner Byrne also pointed out, adoption of this directive and tomorrow’s report is of the utmost importance both for the development of the internal market and for consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by thanking all my fellow Members who sought to improve this document and find a solution with their contributions. In particular, I would like to thank Mrs Paciotti, who deputised for me for a time when I was absent owing to ill health, and did an outstanding job on my behalf. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, Commissioner, for your proposal; it provides a basis to work on. Happily, this Parliament will separate after working on that basis. You know that we support the ambitious concept with which you began, that of total harmonisation, but we can see how difficult it will be to push through. Perhaps we should do more work around that concept, in order to achieve real consumer protection, which is what we are interested in.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the clarity and efficacy of this text, it seems to us that what Parliament is actually proposing on the subject of harmonised rates is a useful path to follow. We retain only one rate, the overall effective annual rate. That will make things much simpler for everybody. Let us bear in mind, however, that consumer goods are goods for which credit is a particular kind of credit, inasmuch as, as soon as that credit is contracted, the goods are no longer the subject of credit but rather, in a way, of a debt, since the goods lose their value as soon as they are purchased.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points to which my attention has been drawn in particular, Commissioner, and, of course, these concern the scope of this directive. As you are aware, practices and conventions vary within the European Union, so that between mortgage credits, between personal loans, and between credits allocated there are very different balances from one Member State to another, and we have to face up to the reality of the mechanisms and risks of dumping which exist as a result of different national practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, if you remove mortgage credits from this directive and move them to another directive you will be opening up the field to the banks, which will take advantage of mortgage credits to attack other consumer credit markets. I do not think that that is the objective sought by this directive which should, first and foremost, protect all forms of consumer credit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet that confidence is based on consumers’ ability to conclude, without incurring any legal or economic risk, all kinds of commercial transactions, in particular by means of new electronic trading procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The systems for preventing and penalising infringements of consumer laws currently in force in Member States generally function in the context of national markets, but are unsuitable for use at Community level. This deficiency obviously works to the advantage of unscrupulous operators, to the detriment of consumers and honest traders.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, therefore, only welcome the Commission’s initiative, which consists in setting up a network of authorities which are able to cooperate with one another in order to rid the internal market of dubious practices, although I, for one, would have preferred us to opt for a network that would be completely public in nature, along the lines of the committee’s original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the need to take into account the diversity of Community practices and the urgent need to make this instrument available, however, I believe it is reasonable to adopt the compromise which has been achieved, in particular thanks to the work of our rapporteur. I would therefore like to express the hope that a real spirit of mutual assistance will prevail in the cooperation between Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a debate about people and our concerns for them. I would like to say, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, that we very much support what the rapporteur has said on unfair commercial practices, that is, that the principle of the vulnerable consumer must be accepted and recognised, that we must take into account disparities between national protection rules, that we must insist on a double legal basis and that the principle of optimum harmonisation should hold good for all three directives.</p>
<p class="contents">In my remaining seconds I would just say that I am very grateful indeed to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, on the issue of enforcement for accepting that each state should be allowed to decide how the regulation should be implemented by the public authorities, but according to Amendment No 76 it will be implemented by public authorities in alliance with, but not supplanted by, other public interests and by NGOs. This is a good day for consumers and, despite the rather stunted debate we have had, we should shout that fact from the rooftops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the framework directive is concerned, our group’s guiding principle is that a high level of consumer protection is a prerequisite for the actual application of the principle of mutual recognition. We accept the restriction of the scope in respect of the industry-consumer relation. However, in order to clarify the connection between this framework directive and the competition-related aspects to everyone, we would still like to table amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To our group, the average consumer remains the point of reference. We accept that further amendments will be tabled, but these amendments may not go so far as to fundamentally depart from the option. In addition, we remain adamant that it should explicitly be stated that the black lists of aggressive and misleading trade practices are exhaustive in character and that the directive’s harmonisation objective may not be undermined. If the black lists are amended, we believe this should be done by way of the codecision procedure. We also remain convinced that a double legal basis for the framework directive is not justified, not necessary and surplus to requirements. We will therefore follow the legal recommendation of our Legal Service and endorse the reasons that we have previously clarified in the various committees.</p>
<p class="contents">During this part-session, as in past ones, we have enacted much fine legislation on consumer protection, and it has only been thanks to Commission proposals that we have been able to do this. I would therefore echo everyone who wants to thank the Commissioner today for the proposal we have received, for without the Commission proposals we would not have been able to do the work. It is, of course, the case that, no matter how many fine laws we enact, legislation depends entirely on their effective implementation and enforcement. That is why I am a great fan of the Commission proposal to develop a network of administrative bodies that are responsible for the application of all those fine consumer directives. I very much welcome this Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Members of this House will reconsider the amendments, because I know that there are people in our group who would very much regret it if we were to end up with a regulation that is all too bureaucratic and involving a great deal of red tape. We would regard that as indefensible. We should therefore ensure that we get a maximum number of votes to approve the proposal for a network. We should ask the Council to reconsider the matter. After all, it should not always be the case that we adapt to the Council’s position. We agree on a great many points. We should, for once, ask the Council to adapt to Parliament and respect democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we know, there was an initial stage of indecision, during which the rapporteur thought that the directive was being modified in committee, which led this proposed directive being referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but, fortunately, we managed to resolve the issue and finally the rapporteur decided, in agreement with us, to present it once again with a series of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problem is lack of time. This term of office is coming to an end. During this term of office, Parliament has not been able to complete its examination of the proposed directive and we are limited to a first reading so that the next Parliament may have the opportunity to examine it in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern is naturally not to kill off consumer credit – which, for better or for worse, has become an essential part of our lives – and also to provide a guarantee that credit will not end up being a noose around the consumer’s neck.</p>
<p class="contents">Our amendments are of a different nature. Some, for example, relate to the legal basis. We believe it is important to introduce Article 153 as an additional legal basis in the field of consumer protection and, furthermore, we also believe it is important to point out certain elements in the definitions. In the definitions and above all in the adherence to certain basic principles, such as, for example, the APR – Annual Percentage Rate – which is a concept we have developed here, and we must prevent it from being replaced by other criteria which are much more difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we hope that tomorrow's vote may lead to a directive which is clearer to the consumer and that on this basis the next Parliament can definitively approve this directive which is so important for all the European Union's consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is both astonishing and depressing how much energy some Members have put into attempts to water this proposal down. I cannot conceive of a situation in which everyone but the consumer has rights in the internal market. That has been truly depressing, but I welcome this proposal, and hope that a large majority in Parliament will support the compromise proposal drawn up by Mrs Gebhardt.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Mr Wuermeling’s report on credit for consumers, I must say that I welcome the fact that we are having the debate today and that we have managed to make a good deal of progress. As previous speakers have said, improvements are needed, however, because otherwise there is a risk of the directives diluting the rights that consumers already have.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier on, a speaker mentioned the actual annual percentage rate of charge, and in this case, too, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I should like to see a broader definition. The right to earlier repayment must also be improved. I do not think that the rapporteur’s compromise proposal goes far enough in this respect. As I often do in these debates, I should just like to mention the right to number portability in the telecommunications sector, which has given consumers important rights. In my home country, costs have fallen by 7% over the past year, and I think that the right to repayment has been a significant contributory factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that better information on credit cards is needed, and that the exclusions in some amendments are not really desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in my opinion, joint and several liability is really needed in order to develop the internal market and afford consumers protection when new products are placed on the market. I should also like to mention here something that happened in my home country. A new low-cost company went bankrupt, and only those consumers who had paid by credit card had any kind of protection. This also goes to show that this aspect is necessary for consumers when markets are developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last Friday I visited Blantyre in my constituency to talk to an alliance of Credit Unions in that part of Scotland. As the Commissioner will know very well, Credit Unions in some parts of the Union provide cheap and affordable types of safe credit to consumers through voluntary organisations carrying out voluntary effort in a non-profit way.</p>
<p class="contents">They were very concerned early on in the process that they may be caught in some of the technicality of this directive. I am extremely grateful to Mr Wuermeling for the way in which, in Amendments Nos 4 and 62, he has sought to create an exemption for that kind of activity. It is really very important and my constituents were very grateful to learn just how much had been done in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">While there may be still issues among us about the exact balance between the consumer and the lender contained in the Wuermeling report, we are all agreed that it is vitally important to make safe the internal market so that there can be much wider trade, but not at the cost of unfairness to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate him genuinely on the work he has done. While we will be supporting some amendments against him tomorrow, it will not be at the cost of backing the general project.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for Mrs Gebhardt's proposal. We are talking about consumer rights. No rights without remedies is a good old slogan and I think that the point of the new regulation of which the Commissioner and Mrs Gebhardt have spoken is very much to secure that there are adequate and forceful remedies for rights that we all support.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, if I may say to Mrs Ghilardotti, the idea that we should begin to develop a jurist prudence of fair-trading in the European Union is a grand one. This will be done, of course, in a negative sense by generating a general duty not to trade unfairly. I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti for all the work she has done. There may be one or two points of disagreement in the vote tomorrow, but the point is that we are all piloting the boat in the same direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, in our view, far too long, not least because the positions of the advisory committee were largely determined as early as before the summer of 2003. It very much looks as if the European Commission, which proposes maximum harmonisation, has wrongly evaluated the political feasibility of this. My group, on the other hand, endorses minimum harmonisation of consumer credit provisions, so that the acquired rights in the Member States remain in place. One of the acquired rights in my country, the Netherlands, is that consumers are allowed to run up a short-term debt with a bank on their current account without any extensive contracts. We call this being ‘in the red’. It is being proposed, with good reason, to delete paragraph 2c of Article 3 by means of Amendment No 52. I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether he will be adopting this amendment. Can existing practice of current-account credit remain in place under the new directive without any extra administrative steps?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to draw attention to the Commission proposal on unfair trade practices. Article 4 of this proposal states that traders need only meet the requirements that apply in their home countries. Consumers will find that incomprehensible; they want the protection that they enjoy in their own countries. This article constitutes a huge stumbling block in terms of effective consumer protection. Traders simply need to comply with the requirements applicable in the country where they introduce their products onto the market. Our group has for that reason tabled Amendment No 95 to address this problem. I hope that this will meet with approval from the House. I should like to hear from the Commissioner here whether this amendment could also be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If one thing is clear it is that Directive 87/102/EEC no longer reflects the situation in the credit market. We could say that all we Europeans are currently plagued by debt. We therefore need a directive which prevents the impression being given, when consumers are offered credit, that we never have to return the money, for two reasons which I believe to be fundamental: firstly, in order to harmonise the conditions in which consumer credit is offered and, above all – and this, incidentally, is a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists – in order to guarantee consumers a high level of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that I do not have sufficient time to comment to the Commissioner on the amendments we consider essential in order to fulfil these two objectives at least. I do hope, however, that some of my fellow Members can do so, because consumers must be protected in an age when it appears that credit is never going to be repaid. We citizens do have to repay what we owe, but our debts are more than we can afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, dishonest traders take advantage of the new technologies provided by the information society, thereby undermining consumer confidence in <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems do not only closely concern consumers, but also businesses and the economy as a whole. In order to protect consumers, therefore, we have to establish a body of clear, effective rules and also strengthen cooperation between national consumer protection authorities, by promoting information exchange and providing for the possibility for authorities approached by consumers to request the assistance of an authority from another country. It is precisely this second, important objective which the proposal for a regulation being discussed and voted on by Parliament this week seeks to secure.</p>
<p class="contents">Current national systems are not capable of preventing and suppressing cross-border exploitation and existing informal networks face obstacles of a legal nature regarding, in particular, difficulties relating to the flow of information from one authority to another and even the lack of public consumer protection authorities in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the regulation lays down precisely the Member States’ obligation to designate a public consumer protection authority, which will be part of a European network. The authority of one Member State may request help from other members of the network in order to investigate possible infringements, to receive information and thereby to end exploitation by dishonest traders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has provided some further guarantees in the proposal for a regulation, in order to avoid possible abuse of power by the national authorities, to protect confidential information held by businesses which is not strictly necessary to the investigation and to ensure that the requests for cooperation are reasonably justified and do not pointlessly impede traders.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation, moreover, provides for procedures which are at times a little cumbersome and onerous for consumers and the public administrations, and risk making the costs far higher than the loss or damage suffered by consumers. This is why we oppose certain provisions laid down by the Council and the Commission which would greatly complicate the system, and if we have to adopt the regulation at its reading before enlargement, we shall ensure that it is reviewed, on the basis of experience gained, five years following its entry into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that, owing to innovation and evolution, many of today's products offer the consumer more choice and flexibility, but many are difficult for consumers to understand: 56% of consumers in the UK did not understand the terms used in credit agreements, 77% find the language in advertising confusing and while 68% are aware that lenders do not calculate APR in the same way, they do not know how the system works and find it difficult to price one loan against another, which makes it difficult for them to shop around for the best deals. More importantly, it also means that credit providers are under less pressure to keep their prices and offers competitive. If this is the case in just one Member State, imagine what the situation is like across 25. This is why the directive must provide maximum levels of consumer protection as regards advertising, information and rules on the calculation of APR and a high level of consumer protection and redress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pinpoint two areas that the Commission should look at more seriously. Firstly, joint and several liability. In the UK, Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act provides for remedies and redress. I understand what the Commissioner is saying: Member States can go further. However, I do not want this directive to be used as an excuse for credit providers to opt out of the very high consumer protection that is already offered in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperatives and credit unions were also mentioned. I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken on board the amendment drafted by Mr Crowley and myself. It is true that credit unions provide a very important service in that they not only offer affordable loans, but also help the poorer elements of the community – the deprived and people on low income – to stay out of the clutches of loan sharks. I fear that if the regulations proposed in this directive were to be applied those consumers in poorer areas would end up with no credit unions and no option but to turn to loan sharks. The PSE voting list tomorrow will reflect our desire not only to see the opening-up of a consumer credit market in this area but also to achieve the highest possible level of consumer protection for consumers right across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the beginning of the mandate we also thought that with the advent of the euro and e-commerce these would deliver a double boost to Europe's economy and the internal market. Sadly the realities have perhaps been more disappointing, particularly with regard to the participation of consumers in cross-border transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an interesting report from the European Consumer Centres who are very much at the sharp end. This report was delivered on European Consumer Day this year. Of 114 cross-border transactions only 75 actually resulted in a delivery. There were problems with payment and problems with refunds. This is hardly the safe, well-functioning market that we had in mind to create, nor have we got the level of confidence that we really need.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that in various complimentary ways these three measures will help to improve matters. The unfair commercial practices legislation should create that high level of consumer protection across the board. With the measures it contains by way of codes to help with alternative dispute resolution, combined with proper enforcement through the enforcement directive, perhaps we will get the access to justice across the market that there ought to be for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to consumer credit, there should be a provision to make sure that consumers are backed up by the credit provider: this provision exists in my own country and others. This should be extended across Europe; one of our amendments to this effect was adopted in committee. It is aspirational for the future to deliver the consumer confidence that we really need to make the market work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate the efforts that the rapporteur and the Commission have made in their desire to do the right thing in terms of cross-border cooperation. Although the usefulness of this is not a matter of doubt, I do wonder whether the proposal put before us by the Irish presidency really does represent an acceptable position and whether we might be creating a bureaucratic monster. Firstly, I think it is quite wrong that we should now, for the first time in the history of the European Union’s lawmaking, be seeking to interfere in the Member States’ right to organise the way in which they, within their own borders, transpose regulations and directives. In this instance, we prescribe that Member States may not transfer certain functions to private bodies, but that these functions must be performed by the authorities, and so that is precisely what we are doing – tampering with matters that are for the Member States to organise – which may well mean that the whole Regulation contravenes the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">My second worry is about the bureaucratic monstrosity of decision-making in the event of dispute. This I can describe only as real-life satire. The situation is that the Member State delegating the function has to consent to the Member State that accepts it entrusting the performance of the tasks to a private body. If neither that, nor the re-examination of the criteria by mutual agreement, is possible, a comitology procedure is set in motion, in which the decision rests with the Commission, so people travel to Brussels from 25 national capitals in order to decide whether or not the matter can, under the directive or a regulation, be referred to private bodies. I see that is quite disproportionate to the matter in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">We should respect the Member States’ exercise of their powers and acknowledge the efficient way in which they perform their functions. I therefore propose that we should stick to what was decided by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. The Council will do likewise when it has come to its senses. Earlier on, Mrs Thyssen pointed out that we have no reason to give way on this; it is the Council that must give way to us, and then this can be adopted quickly, in one reading, but on the basis of the motion for a resolution produced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rather than on the compromise proposed by the Irish presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to expressly thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and the good cooperation between the committees. He had a hard task because the Commission’s draft was, to put it mildly, a bad one. The Commission’s proposal starts from false assumptions. It plays the interests of consumers against those of the banks and in many cases it actually incites the one against the other, despite the fact that Europe needs more cooperation not recrimination, more seriousness instead of populist superficiality.</p>
<p class="contents">We say a clear yes to consumer protection, yes to greater transparency, yes to reciprocal information, yes to lower and upper limits for the applicability of the directive. We say a clear no to more red tape for retail loans, no to making retail loans more expensive and no to the inclusion of overdrafts in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the draft Parliament has produced, based on the rapporteur’s proposals, does justice to the real intentions of this directive, which are to improve consumer protection while cutting bureaucracy, to provide greater transparency and to make for greater trust and mutual consideration, and that it will thereby promote consumer interests and cross-border borrowing.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you all to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur, because that is the only way to increase cooperation rather than conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is his second attempt to reach a compromise on the Consumer Credit Directive, Parliament having opposed many aspects of the proposed directive and referred it back to committee in November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive aims to harmonise laws, regulations and administrative procedures of the Member States concerning agreements covering credit granted to consumers and surety agreements entered into by consumers. Having expressed my opposition to many aspects previously, I will be happy to support Mr Wuermeling's report provided the amendments on so-called 'responsible lending', the compulsory use of credit reference databases and the exemption for mortgages are all adopted, and provided the so-called credit union amendments, 4 and 61, are supported by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Credit Union movement in Ireland and the UK is unique. Most financial institutions that lend money are in business to maximise profits. Credit unions are different as they are owned and run by their members. Each member on their boards and principal committees is a volunteer – there are 15 000 of them in my own country – as are the majority of their staff, except in the larger credit unions which have up to 2000 paid employees. They are restricted from operating outside their local geographic area and provide mainly small amounts of credit for low-income members and for those in financial difficulty. Through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service known as MABS in Ireland, they provide access to credit for individuals who are often seriously in debt and otherwise prey to illegal money lenders providing loans at impossibly high interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, where we have less than four million inhabitants, there are 2.5 million members of credit unions with savings in excess of EUR 9 billion. 37% of loans issued by the credit unions are for EUR 750 or less. The average loan is EUR 7000. A total of EUR 5 billion is out on loans at the moment. Effective leadership for all our credit unions on the island of Ireland is provided by the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, harmonisation is needed and welcomed to the extent that it respects the different range of financial products and the cultural differences in financial services in each Member State. We need a balance here in protecting the consumer from the lender and the lender from the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's original proposal failed to do almost all these things, and Mr Wuermeling's report, which we warmly welcome, is a significant step in the right direction and a substantial improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as a number of colleagues have said, consumer rights have to have proper enforcement mechanisms. The other two proposals being discussed tonight have that link in common. We warmly welcome Mrs Gebhardt's to achieve a compromise, which we will support because it is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made substantial progress in developing a workable proposal on the issue of unfair commercial practices, where enforcement is the key. There is no point in having new rights for consumers unless they can be enforced. Companies need to know where they stand in relation to their national legislation and they also need to be encouraged to adopt best practice through codes of conduct. We have moved substantially in that direction. The important proposal of mutual recognition is also absolutely essential to making everything work successfully.</p>

I know that there is much common ground between Parliament and the Commission. Allow me to respond to some of the points that have been made during the course of the debate and to indicate the Commission's position on the key amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, enforcement cooperation. On this regulation the Commission can accept all the amendments tabled in the plenary by the rapporteur as they reflect the compromise reached with the Council towards a first reading adoption of the regulation. Amendments that are not part of the compromise package are not supported by the Commission. Prolonging discussions beyond the compromise reached with the Council will not bring material improvements to our capacity to better enforce consumer protection rules. It would, however, provide rogue traders with more time to exploit the absence of effective cooperation between the enforcement authorities in the Member States. The compromise represents a reasonable balance between the enforcement traditions of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important question in these discussions has been the public nature of the network proposed. The thinking behind the Commission's proposal was that only public authorities can deliver adequate guarantees on effectiveness and confidentiality. In a minority of Member States effective enforcement is fulfilled by financing private consumer organisations to take action on behalf of the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 76 successfully reconciles both traditions. Those Member States with a strong tradition of private consumer bodies would be able to delegate a fair number of cross-border cases to them. In the cases which involve confidential information or which require significant investigation, in other words the most serious rogues, a public authority will be lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference to comitology was inserted at the request of those MEPs who support delegation by Member States. For a Member State prevented by another Member State from delegating to a private body, it provides a useful opportunity to air grievances.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 29, removing 8(2)(b) and 8(2)(c), will be completely unacceptable to Council and the Commission. Both have argued that 8(2) is a package and cannot be touched. I therefore commend that particular approach to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to be debating the Consumer Credit Directive here today. It is now a little over 19 months since the Commission sent this proposal to Parliament, just a few weeks less than the gestation period of the elephant, and I suppose it is not surprising therefore that we have this weighty tome from the rapporteur. I am sure the rapporteur will understand if I do not accept all of his amendments, although I am trying to adopt a compromise approach to his position and to his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and discussed today can be accepted by the Commission. Some can be accepted partially or with limited changes. I also note that more than 200 amendments were tabled for this plenary sitting which, together with the comments from the various speakers, demonstrates that opinions are very divided. This reflects the divide in approach to consumer credit throughout the European Union. I am nevertheless heartened by the fact that on the two principal objectives, namely ensuring a high level of protection and the creation of a genuine single market for consumer credit, there is a broad consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the number of technical issues that have been raised, it would lead me too far astray to comment on all of them. I will therefore focus on some of the main issues. I wish to reiterate that full harmonisation will not lead to a reduction in the level of consumer protection. Full harmonisation will apply to the areas for which the directive provides for such harmonisation, namely those areas most relevant to the operation of the single market. The Commission is willing to consider excluding areas from the scope of the proposal that would not affect the single market. For these areas, Member States can maintain their national provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Credit intermediaries should only be submitted to national supervision. Registration requirements would no longer be foreseen. Provisions already covered by existing legislation can in general be deleted; for instance, provisions on door-step selling. The same applies to matters covered by national civil law, such as the provisions on repossession and sanctions. However, as I said before, this directive also aims at guaranteeing a high level of protection for consumers in the area of credit. I cannot, therefore, accept amendments that would lead to a reduction in the level of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding small loans or overdrafts, it is possible to submit credit unions to a lighter regime principally based on the provision of information. I am always interested to hear Sir Neil MacCormick tell the stories of his constituents and his recent experience in his constituency. I am sure he would be happy to hear that I have been invited to my own home town of Monasterevin in County Kildare, a small country town, to open a credit union within the next couple of weeks, where I will be emphasising these points.</p>
<p class="contents">On mortgages, the Commission recognises that there are a number of important practical and legal problems, principally related to the fact that such loans are secured by a mortgage on immovable property. We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that increasingly consumer spending and consumer credit arrangements are financed through loans secured by a mortgage on immovable property through so-called equity release mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal issues surrounding such contracts are indeed complicated, but the risks associated with consumers putting up their family home as collateral for consumer spending merit the attention of regulators and consumer protection provisions are warranted. Questions surrounding mortgage-backed credit are being discussed in the forum group on mortgage credit which is due to present a preliminary report in June 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also take account of the discussions of this group in formulating its revised proposal. In this respect I also wish to note that the Commission is ready to accept the ceiling proposed. Credits for amounts above this ceiling would fall outside the scope of the directive. Typically, credits for such amounts typically are secured by a mortgage. Concerns have been expressed about the fact that the Commission's proposed regime on joint and several liability will lead to a significant reduction of protection in a number of Member States. The Commission confirms that this is not the intention and believes the directive should not undermine the relevant national regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti's report, subject to minor changes in some cases. I will therefore focus on the areas where the main difficulties arise. Under the proposal any practice which is misleading or aggressive automatically meets the criteria for unfair practice under the general prohibition. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 32 because this would require the tests of the general prohibition to be reapplied to misleading or aggressive practices. This would reduce legal certainty. Amendment No 58 is also not acceptable because it will break the connection between the Article on aggressive practices and the tests in the general prohibition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to adjust the specification of the benchmark consumer which would be used to assess the impact of commercial practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Following our consultation we have taken a measured approach to the disclosure of information. The proposal focuses on the essential information which, if not given to consumers, or apparent from the context, is likely to mislead. While some of the proposed adjustments are acceptable, others would upset this balance either by removing key information or by adding extra requirements which would impose costs without bringing any real benefits to consumers. Amendments Nos 46 and 49 to 57 are therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures in the Annex have been selected because they are not in all circumstances unfair and so can be prohibited up front. But they are arrived at by applying the tests of the general clause and must fall within the scope of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also against the idea of a double legal base which some people have proposed. I know that some speakers hope for the inclusion of Article 153. However Article 153(1), makes a cross-reference to Article 95, which is the legal base for this piece of legislation, and Article 153(4) refers to legislation which can only be used in areas where you have minimum harmonisation. That is not our ambition. I therefore urge Parliament to follow the draft and to follow the advice of Parliament's Legal Service which, I understand, is of the same view as me.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I only referred to a number of specific amendments or themes. A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments on the three reports discussed in this joint debate is being made available to Parliament's secretariat and I trust this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for the joint debate.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
