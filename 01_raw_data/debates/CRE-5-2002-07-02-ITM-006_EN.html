<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duisenberg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">ECB</span>. – Mr President, six months ago we witnessed a milestone in European history: the launch of "the euro, our money", in its visible form. European citizens are now able to perceive – and to benefit from – the tangible reality of the euro, and the rapid substitution of what we call the legacy currencies at the beginning of this year bears witness to the successful launch of the euro banknotes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2001 provided a particularly challenging environment for the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. The worsening economic outlook was accompanied by short-term upward pressures on prices from various sources, which complicated the conduct of monetary policy. This task was made even more difficult by the extreme uncertainty which followed the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">As usual, the monetary policy response of the ECB to such a situation had to look beyond short-term developments, focusing on the risks to price stability over the medium term. From this perspective, we could see that medium-term inflationary pressures were in fact receding. The ECB took account of this by reducing interest rates four times in 2001, by a total of 150 basis points. As a consequence, the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the ECB – the most important amongst our key interest rates – reached 3.25% in November 2001. The key ECB interest rates have remained unchanged since November and short and long-term real interest rates have been, in a historical perspective, very low.</p>
<p class="contents">The average annual inflation rate in 2001, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, was 2.5%. Inflation in 2001 was affected by the lagged effects in import price increases in 2000, and by the new impact of livestock diseases on unprocessed food prices. We are not satisfied with such an outcome, which is not in line with price stability. However, it has to be recognised that the factors which contributed to shaping this outcome could not be controlled by the ECB. In fact, monetary policy only affects inflation with a lag and cannot control it in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are satisfied that our policy last year was very well understood by our observers and by the markets. In fact, the level of bond yields, as well as various other indicators of inflation expectations of economic agents, pointed to continued confidence throughout 2001 in the ECB maintaining price stability in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">There were – and there still are – some concerns about the possible impact of the cash changeover on euro area inflation, which have also been echoed in the draft resolution on the ECB's Annual Report prepared by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Indeed, the increase in annual consumer price inflation in the euro area from 2.0% in December 2001 to 2.7% in January 2002 has unfortunately been associated, in many people's minds, with the cash changeover. In reality, other factors contributed to this increase, such as the rise in vegetable prices related to adverse weather conditions, particularly in southern Europe, and higher tobacco taxes in several euro area countries. But it has also to be recognised that, in particular in some sectors with a low level of competition, some upward price adjustments might have occurred in connection with the cash changeover. However, there were also price reductions in the euro area associated with the cash changeover and statistical evidence has so far confirmed that the effect on the overall price level has been contained.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the current economic situation, over the past few months economic conditions have gradually changed. The impact of the terrorist attacks on economic confidence has gradually faded away and economic activity has stabilised. While the strength of the ongoing recovery is still subject to uncertainty, the most likely scenario is for economic activity to gradually accelerate and reach levels in line with trend potential growth later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding monetary developments, we saw a high demand for liquid and safe assets in the autumn of last year, particularly associated with financial market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks. We saw some moderation in early 2002 but recent data indicate a new increase in the demand for liquid assets. In addition, the decline in the growth of loans to the private sector has come to a halt and credit demand has recently strengthened. These developments need to be closely monitored, as they may start to point to upward risks to price stability, in particular during a period of economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the outlook for price stability is now less benign than it was in November 2001, when we last adjusted the key ECB interest rates. Inflation has so far declined less steeply and less rapidly than we expected at the turn of the year. This again has been partly due to the temporary factors I mentioned before, and to the renewed increase in oil prices in the first quarter of 2002. At the current juncture, even though the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro will contribute to easing inflationary pressures, we will continue to closely monitor all relevant developments, against the background of the risks that the deviations from price stability, which followed the exceptional clustering of upward shocks on inflation over the past couple of years, may be transmitted into longer-term inflation expectations, thereby potentially affecting wage and price-setting behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain price stability, it is crucial that wage moderation prevails also in the future. In this respect, we are concerned about recent trends in wages here and there. The importance of wage developments in line with our definition of price stability cannot be overemphasised. Wage moderation is a key factor in favouring the expansion of employment and in helping to create the conditions for a sustainable increase in the potential growth rate of the euro area economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Current estimates for trend potential growth in the euro area are in the order of 2-2½% and there is much scope for raising potential growth in the euro area. The ECB will make its contribution by focusing on maintaining price stability in the medium term. But other policy actors also have to take up their responsibilities. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2002, which have just been approved in Seville, place the emphasis quite rightly on the need for further structural reforms in the euro area. I understand that this view is also shared in the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The future welfare of euro area citizens will also depend to a large extent on the prudent conduct of fiscal policies. The solidarity pact of our monetary union requires all participants to maintain a medium-term perspective in compliance with the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. This implies that budgetary positions in all countries should be close to balance or in surplus over the business cycle as a whole in order to allow sufficient room for a smooth functioning of automatic stabilisers. We have seen some worrying developments in fiscal policy in some countries over the last few months. We therefore recall the importance for those countries that still have not achieved a balanced budget position to honour their commitments to catch up with the other countries of the euro area by 2003/2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some other issues raised in the draft resolution on the ECB's Annual Report. We welcome the draft resolution's clear support for the ECB's monetary policy strategy. The draft resolution concludes that short-term movements in monetary aggregates should not be overemphasised and that there should not be any mechanical reaction to deviations of M3 growth from the reference value. This is fully in line with the ECB's monetary policy strategy and practice. The first pillar of our strategy, which gives a prominent role to the analysis of monetary developments, is based on the empirical evidence of a close and stable relationship between money and prices in the euro area over the medium term. There is no evidence yet to suggest that this link has weakened over time. The ECB is fully aware that monetary developments may be subject to portfolio shifts in the short term, which are not directly related to future spending decisions. Indeed, what matters is to identify and understand the underlying reasons for monetary developments in order to assess the implications for the risks to price stability over the medium term. In this respect, the analysis of monetary developments has provided useful guidance to the ECB's monetary policy also over the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">This then leads me to another point mentioned in the draft resolution, namely the importance for a central bank to take account of asset prices when assessing risks to price stability, while not introducing moral hazard in financial markets through inappropriate reactions to excessive asset price developments. The ECB fully shares this view. It closely monitors asset price developments as indicators for monetary policy but it does not target them or react to them mechanically.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposed endorsement of macroeconomic projections by the Governing Council of the ECB, allow me to clarify once again the role of those projections in the process of monetary policy-making at the ECB. These projections play an important role for us, but they have by no means an all-encompassing role. They are an important technical input by ECB and national central bank staff in summarising and assessing the implications of a large body of information for future inflation in a consistent way. However, we are also fully aware of the difficulties of making projections. In particular, we recognise that it is impossible to summarise all the relevant information for assessing the maintenance of price stability in one single projection. Given the difficulties of forecasting over the longer term and the uncertainty regarding the appropriate economic model, we do not advocate the use of a single projection to analyse the risks to price stability. We therefore explicitly look at many other indicators and analyses in the context of our two-pillar strategy, and we do not try to hide the complexity of monetary policy-making behind the production of a single Governing Council forecast.</p>
<p class="contents">The projections reflect the expert judgement of Eurosystem staff and we prefer to keep this distinct from the judgement of the Governing Council regarding the overall assessment of the risks to price stability. Therefore, our decision to clearly separate the production of the projections from the analysis of the Governing Council is fully transparent as it honestly reflects the decision-making process within the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards communication, we have always taken an approach that ensures a high level of transparency and clarity of our message. Our monthly press conferences are key in this respect. The timeliness and the detail of our communication are without comparison. At the same time, we have not changed our view regarding the publication of minutes. We fear that, given the multi-country context in which the Governing Council works, published minutes – or a procedure in which dissenting views of Council members are published (even without mentioning names) – could lead to undue pressure on national central bank governors to deviate from a euro area perspective. This cannot be in the interest of the euro area, no more than if the Governing Council were to end its approach of speaking with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution also suggests that the balance of votes within the Governing Council should be published anonymously. As I stated in my last testimony, I have some doubts whether this would give more clarity to the markets or more transparency than is the case now. In any event, I believe it is crucial that we continue to place the emphasis of our communication on the economic rationale behind monetary policy decisions, rather than on a pattern of differing views in the Governing Council.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude my statement, I should like to briefly refer again to the euro cash changeover. With a single currency, our citizens now have a common symbol of European identity which they use in their daily lives. Indeed, the euro has created the foundations that may stimulate further integration – in the political, economic and financial fields. In this sense, "the euro, our money" can provide a new and more solid basis on which to build an "ever closer union".</p>

Measures taken by governments in the Euro area to reorganise public finances have created a basis for sustainable economic growth and a strengthening of the euro. Although I do not at present see any need to alter the Stability and Growth Pact of 1997, I nevertheless support the notion that any possible uncovered pension obligations in the Member States and current levels of taxation should also be taken into consideration when assessing payments made by euro countries in compliance with that agreement. Funded pension obligations and low taxes do mean there is more room to move in a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">During recent months the euro has strengthened against the dollar. Although parity in itself has no economic importance it is nevertheless a psychologically significant sign of the confidence market and financial players have in the stability of the Euro area and a development that is seen as positive. I agree with the ECB’s judgment that the strengthening of the euro against the dollar is a positive development, as long as the currency strengthens in a controlled way and not too fast. Increased private investment in the Euro area shows that investors have more faith in the future of the Euro zone than they do in the medium-term economic prospects of the United States of America. Enron, Xerox, Worldcom, as well as any subsequent cases, will probably only serve to strengthen this development.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to what impact the strengthening of the euro will have on inflationary pressures. In the last few days we have been hearing conflicting messages from Mr Eichel and Mr Solbes, among others. It has, for example, been stated that the euro’s parity with the dollar is reducing pressure on the raising of interest rates. Others, meanwhile, have been concerned about the strengthening of the euro against the dollar, as was revealed, for example, in the interview Commissioner Solbes gave last Saturday. How in this connection are we to appraise, furthermore, the action that the ECB took last Friday when it intervened in the currency markets in collaboration with Japan? I would very much like to hear Mr Duisenberg’s view of this matter, and especially concerning whether the strengthening of the euro against the dollar will make it possible to keep interest rates at their present level. Inflation is 1.7% at the moment, its lowest since December 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week’s M3 growth figures were higher than predicted. This raises the question as to how this will affect the ECB’s current monetary policy. This fundamental question relates to the whole role of the first pillar. We support the two-pillar strategy. The long-term link between money and inflation is recognised by most academics. However, first pillar management is complex and is sometimes ill suited to day-to-day decision-making. I would hope that the ECB will explain the content and role of the first pillar in detail in its monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the markets are highly volatile, it is more important than ever for the ECB to act transparently. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the European Central Bank and its chairman for improvements in its information practices and its positive attitude to dialogue with Parliament regarding monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in its report, Parliament encourages the ECB Governing Council to exploit the decision-making process made possible by the EU Treaty by voting. This will make it possible to react to changes in developments more rapidly if necessary. The results of voting in the Governing Council should also be made public. If dissenting opinion and any results of voting are published anonymously it will strengthen the confidence, such as it is now, the markets have in the European Central Bank. Making more information available will enable better forecasts to be made of future developments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the opinions of our citizens that are the basis for our work. Two out of three consumers in the Euro area believe that when they switched to the euro prices went up and products became more expensive compared to average prices at the end of the previous year. This feeling they have is not, however, borne out by statistics on inflation. The measures Member States have taken to stabilise their economies have led to a very low average inflation figure over the last three years. The occasional, relatively tiny price rises in the service sector were felt by consumers to be surprisingly dramatic. We must therefore in future ensure that the public is very clearly informed about developments concerning the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">According to research, over 60% of consumers still do not think in euros when they consider the prices of products. For this reason I would urge Member States to keep to dual pricing to allow us all more time to get used to our new money. We must not permit any gap in our awareness of prices, and consumers in the future must be able to prevent additional inflation though their own purchasing decisions. Dual pricing will also ensure that the forthcoming holiday period in central Europe will flow smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week a figure who was at the heart of the subject of our discussion today passed away at the age of 88: Luxembourg’s Prime Minister, who was in office for many years and was one of the founding fathers of the euro, Pierre Werner. In the 1970s Mr Werner drafted the Werner report, named after him, which created a basis for setting up the European Central Bank. I too, as the European Parliament’s rapporteur, wish to dedicate the last part of my speech to the memory of Mr Werner. Pierre Werner was a man of great vision. The European Union is founded on common visions – the views of our continent’s citizens and statesmen – of how common European challenges should be resolved. We must bear in mind these visions, these common aims, and, moreover, the jointly agreed principles regarding responsible and sustainable economic policy, when we seek solutions to our continent’s political and economic problems.</p>

First, I want to thank the rapporteur for a highly comprehensive report which not only evaluates the ECB's report, but also enlarges on it and adds demands for future action, some of which originated in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Secondly, I want to thank you, Mr Duisenberg, and the Executive Board for your good cooperation with Parliament and especially with our Committee, although there is room for improvement on both sides. For our part, we are endeavouring to step up dialogue and make it more exciting, to put questions in clearer terms and elicit more definite answers from you, whilst expecting that you will engage in more public information work.</p>
<p class="contents">The public does not always find it easy to discern the thinking behind the ECB's decisions, but we are all aware that its policies directly affect purchasing patterns and the currency; hence the need for more public information to achieve greater transparency, acceptance on the part of the European public, and the stimulation of the economy within the framework outlined in your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to congratulate you not only on the work you have done and on the balance sheet you have produced, but also on what you did in the aftermath of 11 September, when the ECB's measures on interest rate and liquidity policy, agreed in consultation with the Federal Reserve Bank, made a good impression as an immediate response to the attacks and one by which the threat of a financial crisis could be successfully averted. Congratulations also on the successful introduction of euro notes and coins, which faced us in this House with the problem of having statistics indicating, on the one hand, that the introduction went without a hitch, and, on the other, that there was great public uncertainty, on which paragraph 18 of the resolution is intended to have an effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity of my speech today to make it clear that the Stability and Growth Pact has played a part in the success of the euro and of the ECB, and that we resist all attempts at reinterpreting and nullifying the Stability and Growth Pact, which arise from short-sighted opportunism in response to day-to-day political events; the aftermath of enlargement will call for further structural and other reforms in politics and in the ECB. We hope that your work will continue to meet with such success and that you will also prove equal to these challenges.</p>

It is true, in view of this year's presentation, that the European Central Bank is especially to be congratulated not only on having managed to make the eurozone an object lesson in the importance of the euro as a response to external shocks, but also on the introduction of euro notes and coins having been so successful.</p>
<p class="contents">We have detected some dissatisfaction with the new money on the part of some members of the public, but Europe has in any case demonstrated that it can achieve something when it stands shoulder to shoulder. According to one survey, 64% of all members of the public at last feel a little more like Europeans now they have the euro in their pockets. That is the way it should be!</p>
<p class="contents">The public's price awareness, however, is not as it should be, as the real rate of price increase in the eurozone, which is statistically verifiable and extremely low, does not relate to the inflation that people perceive. Parliament was therefore right always to back a campaign of information and to insist that the introduction of euro notes and coins should be understood as a conversion not merely in the technical sense, but also as one with great psychological significance. That being the case, it is also important that we should send out positive signals. The fact that consumers can sense overnight the advantages of monetary union when they use a card to withdraw cash, is very important. More advantages will become apparent, for example in the holiday season that is just beginning. That is certainly attributable to Parliament's efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now briefly consider the concerns about the revaluation of the euro. Euro/US dollar exchange rate convergence certainly makes a slow curve desirable, but that cannot be controlled. It cannot, then, be emphasised too strongly that falling import prices in this phase of a slow recovery in the eurozone facilitate an environment that favours an expansive monetary policy and do not in any case necessitate decisions to change interest rates in any direction. The EU is dependent on this in order to keep the Lisbon process on track.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank bears a great responsibility. It is to be hoped that the coordination of economic policies will at last actually create a favourable environment for all the actors. There have recently been less favourable developments in the aggregate money supply, which, however, have a silver lining in that they indicate recovery, being a sign that enterprises are obtaining liquidity for investment in future economic growth, and this, for Europe, is a matter of life and death.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think it important that there should be even greater transparency in the European Monetary Union. I set great store by the European Central Bank's willingness to listen to Parliament's arguments that we should know all the reasoning underlying decisions on monetary policy. That is also good for the European Central Bank's credibility and trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank also has the task of helping to build up financial stability. It counts for a lot with me that the European Central Bank should continue to promote financial stability and, unlike the American Federal Reserve, should not allow its monetary policy to support the creation of speculative bubbles. Even in future, the ECB must not permit its own conduct to give rise to moral hazards! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Huhne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, since there is a very large measure of agreement in this House over the fundamentals of policy towards the ECB, I would like to address one specific measure which we have in the draft resolution, which we have requested before without receiving a formal response from the Governing Council in the Annual Report, and I hope this will be rectified. It is the issue of publishing the balance of votes on an anonymous basis, so that the markets and Parliament can assess the shift of opinion over time.</p>
<p class="contents">You, Mr Duisenberg, have raised objections in the past to such a move, because the Governing Council tends to decide by consensus. I was glad that you indicated to us in committee that you would reconsider this over time. I hope that you will decide to take decisions by majority voting, both because this would lead to more efficient decision-making and because you are asked to do so in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that I do not share the criticism over the last year that the ECB has acted too little and too late. In fact the ECB first cut interest rates in May 2001 despite a continuing rise in inflation, which had still to peak at 3.4%. You have honoured your monetary reference values only in the breach, and in 26 out of 41 months you have allowed inflation to exceed your target range. This is a pragmatic institution. However, we know from the Council of Ministers that voting by consensus, in other words by unanimity, is slower and more difficult than voting by majority.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason alone, it would be sensible for the ECB in future to vote by majority. The fact that present procedures have not led to mistakes is not an argument against improving them, particularly when this is what the Treaty requires. Article 10 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks clearly states that the Governing Council shall act by a simple majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I hope that the Governing Council will also note its Treaty obligations in the manner of its decision-taking by majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Germany, France, Italy and Portugal again recorded relatively high deficits. There are warnings that the incidence of deficits could rise even higher. To put it another ways, budgetary consolidation, second only to the maintenance of price stability as a primary objective of European economic policy, is in danger. Sufficient stability is not being achieved, nor is space being made for policy creation, which is no less important. It is unfortunate that Parliament's report does not give adequate emphasis to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Karas, I take the view that the Stability and Growth Pact deserves to be a matter of controversy. It is, in my judgement, in grave crisis because its reference value of 3% was laid down arbitrarily and is too rigid. In times of stagnation and recession, its shackles prove to have a toxic effect on economic recovery. It is no accident that the eurozone finance ministers have already called on the Commission to take more account of cyclical fluctuations when assessing the Member States' budgetary positions. I therefore strongly urge that the Stability Pact be reformed and supplemented by an employment pact which would require the Member States' economic policies to be comprehensively coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">As we used to hear from France – which is now under a conservative government – the Stability Pact is not graven on marble. The objective must be the speedy creation of room in which an anti-cyclical economic policy can operate. We must not, of course, lose sight of the need to limit debt, and countries cannot be allowed to escape being penalised by higher interest rates on their proliferating debts when they make themselves rich at the expense of others. But, on the other hand, stability policy must not just be about the value of money, and must not impair society's social equilibrium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A simple graph on page 59 shows, however, the drop in the value of the European currency, which is much more significant than all the fluctuations in the participating national currencies since 1994. Similarly, the graph on page 65 on net financial fluctuations in the eurozone in 2000 and 2001 shows considerable jumps which illustrate the lack of investor interest in either the euro zone, our currency, or both.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone will no doubt tell me, however, that the European Central Bank’s report was right not to emphasise these slightly less positive aspects since the euro is now faring better, and that we have come through the difficult patch. This is a claim that we must verify. For the time being, what we are seeing is not investor enthusiasm for the euro, but rather investors adopting a cooler approach to the dollar, related to the bursting of the technological bubble, financial scandals and, above all, we must not forget, the significant difference in interest rates which does not work in favour of the US currency.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, therefore, the dollar’s troubles are working to the euro’s advantage, but we must continue to be cautious because the underlying problems of the European currency are still unresolved. First of all, growth in Europe remains weak, and the introduction of the euro has not stimulated it, in spite of the promises that were made. And, more importantly, there is still a huge question mark for the future, namely that of the problematic coexistence of a single currency and a disparate economic and social zone, whose sub-sections might diverge.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to remedy this problem, some people are contemplating a more or less forced integration. In our view, Mr President, we hope that Europe, in spite of this uncomfortable situation, will be able to remain both flexible and liberal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro is a success: more than 50 countries already have an exchange rate regime for which the euro serves, at least in part, as a point of reference. Our single currency has become the dollar’s equal. When the value of the euro fell in relation to the dollar, some commentators questioned the so-called lack of structural reforms in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Logic dictates that the current rise in the value of the euro against the dollar should be the result of a successful EU structural policy, unless the changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro are not so much due to economic foundations than to the changing mood of the financial markets. After the irrational exuberance on the stock markets and since the bubble of so-called new economy burst, disillusionment is the order of the day. Virtual stock market gains have transformed into real losses. The debt incurred by companies and private individuals is the cause of particular concern. Added to this is the realisation that many champions of the new economy are turning out to be manipulative conmen. During the financial crisis in Asia, many commentators condemned ‘crony capitalism’, capitalism marked by the complicity within these countries. Yet, current events in the United States, and in Europe too, show us that those who preached in Wall Street, the City and elsewhere were comfortably ensconced in a sort of self-service set-up where company directors, business bankers, analysts and auditing firms gave one another a helping hand when needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the world of finance is currently experiencing a sort of uncontrollable collapse which is reminiscent of the crisis of 1929 and subsequent years. Wide-ranging reforms of international finance are therefore essential. The central banks, the EDF and the ECB in particular, must put forward proposals to improve the regulation and supervision of financial markets, including hedge funds. Article 110(1) of the Treaty grants the European system of central banks the right to issue recommendations and opinions. I hope and pray for recommendations from the ECB to combat crony capitalism, to introduce better regulation and supervision, in short, to create the conditions to enable us to regain the general public’s confidence in an ethical financial sector. It is not the danger of inflation that is currently threatening us, but the danger of the financial markets imploding. The ECB cannot shirk its responsibility. In addition, the ECB’s appeals for wage moderation would be much more credible if Mr Duisenberg applied the same language of moderation to investors with capital.</p>

I would first of all like to welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate on the presentation of the Annual Report of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and its rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, for her excellent report. The Commission fully agrees with many of the points of view contained in the report such as, in particular, its positive assessment of the policy of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall only refer to two points from today’s debate, which are of particular interest to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the role of the Stability and Growth Pact in the current process. We believe the Pact has contributed to a favourable reaction by budgetary policies during the recent slowdown. Countries that had already reached a balanced fiscal position have been able to use automatic stabilisers to absorb the effects of reduced growth. Contrary to other situations, meanwhile, no country in debt has implemented unjustified expansionist fiscal policies. Furthermore, the Member States have been able to continue with their fiscal reform policies which will undoubtedly help to eliminate supply rigidity.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I would say that the policy of the first few years of Economic and Monetary Union has contributed to economic growth and to our macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, a combination of monetary policy favourable to growth and a slightly more flexible fiscal policy has sustained cyclical recovery. The lack of fiscal consolidation in the year 2000, however, when economic growth was flourishing, was at the root of some of the obstacles we are currently faced with, in particular in the most indebted countries. We therefore believe that our immediate main objective is to continue with fiscal consolidation and structural reform to enable us to improve our capacity for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the euro and its impact on pricing, using quarterly data, Eurostat has come to the conclusion that in the first quarter of 2002, the inflationary impact of the euro was 0.16% in comparison with the final quarter of 2001. This figure should, however, be used with caution. First, because it is difficult to make these calculations; secondly, because, although this overall figure is correct, we believe there are unusually high increments for certain goods and services that are consumed regularly, which gives citizens the impression that the increase has been far greater; and thirdly, because it is equally true that the euro should, in the medium term, contribute to improving the competitive environment and economic efficiency, thus bringing down consumer prices.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I have to say this afternoon. I shall now hand over to the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Duisenberg, who I expect will have something to add. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have already given a formal answer in my introductory statement, but I would like to add, in particular addressing Mr Huhne, that deciding by consensus does not mean that there is necessarily unanimity, in the sense that if there were a vote all would vote the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Deciding by consensus means that the conclusions reached by the Governing Council as a whole on a certain decision, in a certain direction, or to decide not to change anything, are supported by the entire Governing Council, by some more enthusiastically than others, but this does not require a vote. One always has to remember that although the members of the Governing Council come from all the Member States, they do not represent their Member States, either in the case of national central bank governors or of their central bank. They are there in a personal capacity and are completely independent.</p>
<p class="contents">That also applies to the decision-making process and at all costs we want to preserve the phenomenon that the Governing Council's decisions are decisions by a collegiate body and that every individual member of that body will defend and describe the outcome of certain discussions as if he had been 100% enthusiastic about those decisions. They will be supported by the entire Governing Council. We do not want to undermine that attitude in the Governing Council.</p>
<p class="contents">On prices and the effects of the costs of changeover, to which various Members have referred, it is true that in the public mind many of the price increases that are being observed are being attributed to the changeover to euro banknotes and coins and the rounding-off effects accompanying it. This is true in particular of the goods we purchase every day. For example, you do not pay your rent every day, so there is no problem there. You do not buy a computer every day, so there is no problem there at all, because those prices have been lowered. However, you do notice it in cafeterias, cafes or restaurants or when you try to park your car in the usual place.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, statistically, Eurostat has estimated that of the 0.8% rise in inflation recorded in the first quarter of this year, between 0 and 0.16% could be attributed to the cash changeover. However, there is a difference between the perception of the people at large and the statistical facts now that, as we expected, inflation seems at last to be on the road downwards. We are aware of the latest flash estimate by Eurostat of inflation in June, which is said to be 1.7%, down 0.3% from May. Even if the final figure were to be marginally higher than 1.7% we are on a downward trend. It is also true that we at the ECB expect inflation for the remainder of this year and for next year to hover around this 2% figure and so we are in a situation where we have to be extremely vigilant with regard to the risks that the figure may exceed the 2% limit over the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">There are risks, both upward and downward. The upward risks I defined as coming from the monetary developments and maybe from current wage trends if past inflation figures work their way through in new wage agreements. These risks are being mitigated – and I am grateful for this – by the recent significant appreciation of the euro and so we are weighing time and again the balance of these risks. At the last meeting of the Governing Council at the beginning of June, which was devoted to our stance on monetary policy, this led us to the conclusion that the risks are there, the mitigating effects seem to be emerging, and we must wait and see how things develop.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Berthu's questions on investment decisions vis-à-vis Europe, which now seem to be slightly more attractive because of the exchange rate than in the past, I would like to say that the period of huge capital outflows from Europe in particular to the United States, seems to be over, both in terms of direct and portfolio investment. There are indications that in some instances the flows have reversed and outflows have fallen sharply to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in determining whether Europe is an attractive place for potential investors, including foreigners, be it direct or portfolio investment, the exchange rate is only one of the considerations that are taken into account and a minor one at that. We have to create the climate in Europe by our policies, by our wage trends and by our environment, so as to make Europe a more attractive place to invest in than it has apparently been in recent years. For that reason also it is so crucial that the intentions of our heads of state and government to press on forcefully with structural reforms should be translated from words into deeds sooner, rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">To end with Mr Goebbels' question, as far as regulation of financial markets is concerned, the ECB fully supports the financial services action plan and will do everything in its power to promote the implementation of the plan and promote the further harmonisation of regulations concerning capital market instruments, so that we get a more transparent and comparable capital market in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards supervision, the ECB will do everything in its power to fulfil its Treaty mandate to promote the smooth conduct of supervisory practices. However, I have to remind you that this is the only mandate that the Treaty gives to the ECB, not the supervisory practice itself, or the formulation of the regulations that are in force. We can promote it, we can smooth its path, we can act as a catalyst for good cooperation, but in principle supervision falls under the principle of subsidiarity. We will do our utmost and we are doing our utmost to achieve precisely that.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that I have answered the main questions.</p>
