(IT) </span><span class="bold"></span> Mr President, following allegations, reported in certain influential newspapers, of the existence of clandestine jails run by the CIA in some European Union Member States and also in some accession candidate countries, the Commission would like to point out that a significant number of Member States and candidate countries have issued public statements categorically denying the accusations.</p>
<p class="contents">There has not, so far, been any confirmation or legal proof of such allegations. This type of situation – and here we need to be perfectly clear – would, if it proved to be true, constitute a serious breach of the European Union’s principles, not to mention the laws, including the criminal laws, of Member States, which prohibit events and situations of the type described.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to point out that, under Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union was founded – and operates – on democratic principles and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the rule of law, of course. These principles are also universally shared by the national legislations of the Member States, whose criminal laws forbid the violation of fundamental and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore obvious that the Member States are required to comply with these principles; however, they are also bound to respect international legal obligations, especially those arising under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and under the Convention for the Prevention of Torture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear – as we are all aware – that when a candidate country completes its accession process, the State concerned, in order to qualify for EU membership, must have achieved a level of institutional stability which guarantees total respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and the safeguarding of all fundamental freedoms. This principle was established by the Copenhagen European Council as far back as 1993, and therefore constitutes one of the pillars of the so-called Copenhagen <span class="italic">acquis.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In view of these principles, we obviously consider it vital that Member States and candidate countries investigate the grounds for these press allegations in an appropriate manner, using all legal means available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the recent decision of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly to examine the allegation that secret jails exist in Europe, and we have asked the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly to keep us informed of future developments in this extremely serious and sensitive matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to monitor these allegations closely. We shall do this at the level of Member States as regards compliance with European legislation, and at an international level, with particular reference to any initiatives the US authorities may decide to take in relation to this whole matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I can conclude by giving my personal assurance and that of the Commission that Parliament will be kept informed and engaged in dialogue at all times in relation to developments on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will understand, however, that we shall not feel safe until we are certain that no EU country is involved in the disgraceful decision to host detention centres in which detainees are subject to inhuman acts of cruelty and torture.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no doubt: we all stand shoulder to shoulder with countries that have suffered directly from violent acts of terrorism, such as the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, or any other. We share the determination to combat international terrorism, but feel that every step must be taken in respect of human rights and the primacy of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what some people might think, this is not a sign of our weakness, but rather of our resoluteness. It lends international legitimacy to the fight against terrorism, by setting out clearly what separates us from the terrorists, namely respect for human life and for people’s fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Frattini referred to the international axis, to which all EU countries are committed. The international rules in the various conventions are clear on the circumstances of detention, and on the obligation to give prisoners a fair trial, in front of a competent, impartial and independent court. It is disturbing that almost four years after the UN first requested access to the Guantanamo prison to investigate human rights, this continues to be refused by the US authorities or subject to unacceptable conditions, as reiterated by Mr Rumsfeld a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, as we saw with regard to the Echelon report, there is a difference between the behaviour of the US administration and the Senate. Mr Frattini rightly praised the Council and the initiative of the Committee on Legal Affairs. At this point, I should like to highlight two US Senate initiatives that I wholeheartedly welcome. The first is that of Senator John McCain, which strengthens prisoners’ rights, and the second was proposed by Senator John Kerry, to launch an investigation into the revelations of secret prisons in which torture is apparently permitted, something that we condemn in the strongest terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The newspaper did not name the countries concerned, for security reasons, but let us note that an investigation led by the Human Rights Watch organisation indicated that, in 2002, a number of ‘ghost’ prisoners were in fact detained by the CIA.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recall that the US Congress has also published a report referring to dubious practices employed by the United States when transferring prisoners to third countries with a view to having recourse to acts of torture during interrogations. Moreover, we are extremely concerned by the recent allegations indicating that the Bush Administration wants the US Congress to exempt the CIA from the ban on all forms of abuse of detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">We need these revelations to be placed under an intense spotlight. As you have said, it is not acceptable, in fact, to have areas of lawlessness in Europe and in the world. Hence we, in this Chamber, have always opposed the use of a legal vacuum in relation to the treatment inflicted on the Guantanamo Bay prisoners. Under no circumstances can we therefore allow such prisons to exist in Europe. If the allegations are proven, then what is going on needs to be stopped immediately. If they are not proven, then the evidence needs to be gathered in order to silence the rumours.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Commission to carry out an investigation into these allegations as, I might add, you recently pledged to do in front of the press, Mr Frattini. The results of this investigation must, as I think you will agree, be presented to the Members of the European Parliament. What measures does the Commission intend to adopt in order to ensure that the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and in particular Article 4 thereof, are properly upheld throughout the territory of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to combat the fanatics and the terrorists, as we have already said – and it is not a useless exercise to repeat this – is indeed to pit our values of freedom and of the protection of fundamental rights against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now they have become a United States tactic in pursuit of al-Qa’ida.</p>
<p class="contents">Illegal detention without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay or Iraq is bad enough, but secret detention, where people are kept incommunicado with no access to lawyers and at the mercy of mistreatment or torture, is the blackest of black holes. We see the US Congress now seeking to bar claims for habeas corpus and President Bush and his henchmen trying to stifle the McCain Amendment which would ban inhuman treatment of US detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">In those circumstances, if a credible newspaper and a credible human rights NGO allege that secret war-on-terror jails exist in Eastern Europe, and specifically in Poland and Romania, what do we do? We all agree that it would be devastating to the EU’s reputation and credibility if those allegations were found to be true. Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty stipulate the need to respect human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini says there is no evidence, but what has he done to try and find out? When the allegations came out ten days ago, we were told that Member States would be informally questioned, that technical experts from the relevant directorate would be in contact with their counterparts in the 25 Member States, plus 4 candidate countries. Then we learned that such an examination did not amount to an investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not impugning the good faith of the Polish and Romanian governments, but we know that secret intelligence services sometimes have their own agenda. I am left with a sense of unease and residual doubt when respected organisations have made allegations, but we cannot honestly say they have been thoroughly investigated. All our mechanisms in the EU for ensuring that human rights standards are respected are frankly inadequate: no peer review, no monitoring, no enforcement. The weakness of your Commission, Mr Frattini, was brought out in your remarks. The precedents are not encouraging. The EU failed to establish a common stance, let alone any joint initiatives, to press the US to release our own citizens from Guantanamo Bay. The US went around Eastern and South Eastern Europe penalising countries with loss of military aid if they refused to sign opt-outs from the International Criminal Court for US personnel. The EU did not offer to pay the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">I want you to insist that this matter be put on the agenda of the next General Affairs Council and of the summit in December. This matter needs to be taken up at a political level in order to ensure that the legal guarantees that the EU is meant to offer are fully respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The debate is a first step. I believe that you will be called on to take further steps as regards this issue. Why? Because this is an extremely important issue. It is a question of people who have allegedly been detained, without first having been tried, for an unspecified length of time and without any appeal whatsoever, and who are therefore in all likelihood subjected to torture and inhumane and degrading treatment. We therefore have potential violations here of Articles 3, 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as potential violations of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest news is that two countries, one belonging to the European Union and the other in the process of joining the EU, are cited as having housed such centres. I say ‘having’ housed, since these countries are today denying these acts of which they are accused and because the reports in question date back to 2002 and 2003. What they are denying is taking place today could therefore be compatible with the facts presented in the reports, and particularly in the report by the Human Rights Watch, but the fact of recognising that the potential existence of such centres can constitute a violation of the Treaty on the European Union and Article 6 thereof calls for you to do more than just issue statements, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you are leaving the matter in the hands of the Member States. You say that you are going to examine closely the investigation expedited by the Council of Europe; I will tell you, by the way, that the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights has already decided to invite Mr Marty as soon as his work has been handed over. You say that you are waiting to see what the United States itself decides on this issue and you have expressed your desire for investigations to be carried out at a technical level. I, for my part, believe that all that is far from adequate. Quite simply, Commissioner, you must expedite an investigation in order to shed light on this situation, which is detrimental to the foundations of the European Union and to its credibility on the international stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini, you are denying the obvious. You are denying something that even reliable US sources have admitted. We want you to conduct an investigation, but if there is no desire to find the evidence, the evidence will never be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are perhaps unaware that in Milan, on 17 February 2003, Abu Omar, the former Imam of the mosque in via Jenner, was kidnapped, and that the magistrates in Milan, having found incontrovertible proof that the CIA was directly responsible, have requested the extradition of 22 US intelligence agents.</p>

The Polish Government has issued an official statement denying that there are any prisons of this kind in Poland. It says a lot that the statement makes no direct reference to the past, however. Further investigation is therefore needed into the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The former Minister for National Defence has denied reports that al-Qaeda terrorists are being held in special prisons in our country, but he did so during a radio interview in a manner once favoured by the Soviet news agency TASS. Anything denied by the latter was effectively confirmed as true.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I would call on the Members of the House to keep a sense of proportion during this debate. The war against terror is essential and we must be unyielding and resolute in fighting it, but it must be guided by public opinion. There are two extremes that I firmly believe we must avoid. The first of these is the attitude that the end justifies the means, and that even democratic values and human rights should be sacrificed in the fight against international terrorism. This must not be allowed to happen. Yet we must also ensure that the Western world and the values we uphold are not left in a state of paralysis. I believe that these two extremes should be eschewed, and it would be regrettable if either were to gain ascendancy in the European Parliament or in any EU institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Chamber is the right place to say loud and clear, without hesitation, that the war on terror will be fought hard and ruthlessly, but that it will be guided by public opinion. In this way it will gain a public mandate and public legitimacy in the free West. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens of a sovereign State or States have a legitimate right to live in peace, devoting their lives to their work, to their families and to their freely-chosen lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">Wars have been – and still are – critical periods in the life of society; they upset all the normal benchmarks, but they involve precise military positions, clearly-delineated battlefields, a visible enemy and rules of engagement. Terrorism, on the other hand, does not follow the rules of official war, does not only involve the military and does not operate on the battlefield. It uses underhand tactics to strike the innocent at home, when and where they are least expecting it, with no specific aim, no social purpose and no values.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that everyone must respect the rules, laws and sovereignty of the State. It is undeniable that we all need to uphold not only the most elementary human rights but also the principles underlying all civil society and all relationships between nations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, before levelling accusations at what are undoubtedly democratic countries, we must firstly have full knowledge of the facts and circumstances. We also need to think of the families of the defenceless victims of terrorism in recent years, and of the millions of citizens who are still living under the threat of attack.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot use kid gloves to fight terrorism, but nor can we throw accusations at democratic countries solely on the basis of conjecture. Faced with a choice between terrorism and democracy, I believe we would all choose democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we should allow the courts to do their job without looking for grounds to ascribe blame to countries which certainly do not deserve it. I agree with the position of Commissioner Frattini and hope that, here in Parliament, we shall only make decisions in this matter once we can be sure we are acting democratically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The president of the USA is today threatening to veto the bill adopted by the American Senate in order to impose what was – until a few years ago at least – the obvious; in other words, the fact that international law must be applied to persons arrested by the United States anywhere in the world. All this in 2005, by a large country, by a country with a long democratic tradition, by a country which insists every year in publishing a report on human rights and lambasting other states around the world for violating them.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of the USA affects us all, irrespective of whether these centres are located on European territory. The terrorist argument of double standards in European societies is something they pray for so that they can enlist new terrorists, so that they can undermine our policy. Shall we allow them to do so? What were inconceivable questions before the discovery of the US detention centres must be asked.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these questions is: are there today Member States of the European Union or candidate countries which keep such centres?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, are there today Member States of the European Union or candidate countries which send their detainees to US detention centres? Where do they supposedly wash their hands, while using this network for their detainees? This must be answered.</p>

The commitment you have made here to investigate this situation is therefore laudable, but it does not reassure us.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission and the Council to act firmly and not to be content with nothing more than fine words or denials by politicians expressed at cocktail parties. We expect genuine action and investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, on the orders of the public prosecutor, the police on the island of Mallorca are investigating the illegal transportation of prisoners; it has taken great efforts to do so, but nevertheless, all of the police investigations are moving in exactly the same direction as previous journalistic investigations. And all without any support from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to demand similar investigations by all of the countries which may allegedly be involved in this situation. I would insist, political denials using vague words about the present, that say nothing about the past and which are simply intended to evade responsibility, are not enough. We want a genuine investigation and a commitment to a police and judicial investigation that provides evidence to prove that there is no truth to these allegations.p</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely repugnant to us to see this from a country that has been our ally for a very long time. To see it on European soil, to see centuries of civilisation and moral progress in the fight against crime, or, in this case, against terrorism, renounced is profoundly repugnant to us. Furthermore, Commissioner – and another speaker said this a moment ago – I entirely agree: countries must be innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fact that they are innocent until proven guilty does not mean that you are not required to investigate. The very credibility of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice is at stake. Since that is your responsibility, you cannot rely on explanations given by others.

Germany and Italy are up in arms about reports of its alleged abduction of radical imams in both countries and, as my fellow Member said a moment ago, an enquiry has just been launched in Spain into the transit of suspects via Majorca. It is a matter of rumour in Europe that there are also secret camps, where detainees, deprived of their rights, are kept.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first case, the European countries involved are infuriated, but in the second case, they are partly to blame. You have said as much; you have said that this is in contravention of human rights and of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, but I am very curious as to what you will actually do about it. When the Council of Europe mounts an enquiry, your response to that is just to ask to be kept informed. That strikes me as a very narrow interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as a community of values, cannot afford to look away now, and I want you to take an active part. I want you to check not only with governments, but also with NGOs and the press whether certain statements are true. I want you to talk to members of parliament, and I want to hear you say that, if those statements are true, there has been a contravention of Article 6, at which point an Article 7 procedure is supposed to kick into effect. I want to hear you say that Article 7 is applicable, if the statements are true, that is!</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, however, a merely institutional issue. This is not simply something the Commission has to do, although I do think that it should play a far more active role. It is also, and above all, a political issue. A few moments ago, a Polish Member of this House rightly said that such matters should also be discussed at national level, and I think that we should all go back to our sister parties at national level, for this is something that must be broached with them too. We should not simply place the responsibility with the Commission, but we should, via our own sister parties, ensure that these things are checked to find out whether or not they are true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the use of the Guantanamo Bay military base as a prison where non-Americans can be kept without trial and without support from a lawyer, we know that human rights are violated to that extent by NATO’s most powerful member state too.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we expect virtually everyone to reject such practices, even if this involves people whom we think are a threat to our lives in peace and democracy. If secret prisons are located in one of the current or future EU Member States, or in states that benefit from our neighbourhood policy, then that is a stain on the European claims of democratic rule of law and protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary that the Commission and Council make every effort to put an end to the possible existence of such prisons. Commissioner Frattini now reports that the Member States involved flatly deny their part of the responsibility. He then goes on to refer to the Council of Europe that is already taking care of this matter. If such prisons exist, it has always been the intention to keep their existence secret for ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Their denial is the first instrument to protect this secrecy. This denial does not convince me or certainly those who have drawn your attention to this. The European Union must check out for itself whether there is an American network of secret prisons and whether some of them are located in Europe.

I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this statement myself, of course, since I have not scoured the forests around where the suspect plane is reported to have landed in Poland. Even if a CIA-owned Boeing had in fact landed there in 2003, however, it would not constitute any kind of proof that such camps existed or still exist in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know what reason the plane had for landing. It may have been to refuel, to carry out repairs of some sort, or maybe to take someone on board. We do know, however, that this Boeing also landed in the Czech Republic and Sweden in 2003, and, more recently, in Palma on the island of Majorca. Yet no one is accusing these countries of housing such camps, or voicing suspicions along these lines. One can only ask whether this is because it is mistakenly assumed that there is no such thing as freedom of the media in Poland, and that journalists would not immediately have been hot on the trail of such a sensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically speaking, I would be astonished if the Americans had decided to use an EU Member State for this purpose, thus forcing the country in question to violate the Treaties and EU legislation, instead of using American military bases or countries where freedom of the media really is non-existent or limited. Examples of such countries include Egypt and Thailand. One possibility is that we are participating, at our own behest, in the deliberate sending up of a trial balloon to gauge the reactions of the new EU Member States, by putting the strength of the transatlantic alliance to the test. Another possibility is that someone is keen to point out new targets for al-Qaeda terrorist attacks, and to ensure that these attacks are carried out against Poland and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we should exercise great caution and avoid reading too much into the facts, as certain people have done. In so doing they not only contrive to ensure that Europe’s real problems are pushed to one side, but also place the Polish people at real risk of terrorist attacks. I am delighted that there is a possibility that the Council of Europe will carry out a thorough investigation into this problem, and the sooner this happens the better. In response to Mrs Buitenweg’s suggestion, I should like to make it known that I would be more than happy to invite the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to Poland in order for them to investigate the matter for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the top-secret CIA documents, which virtually the entire European press is currently discussing, the clandestine jails in Poland and Romania, referred to in the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span> and <span class="italic">Human Rights Voices</span>, even have a name – ‘black sites’. They are a sort of no-man’s land, beyond the law and beyond the right of habeas corpus. If proven, these allegations are serious and present us with a difficult problem – the need to find the delicate balance between protecting citizens’ rights and combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline a contradiction – the fact that shortly, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament will tackle the issue of data retention and will again attempt, with a great sense of responsibility, to find common legal and political ground to reconcile rights and emergency situations. We need to protect the rights of citizens and to use all available means to combat terrorism, at the very time when we discover that European countries have become the CIA’s own back yard.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Frattini, what is really serious is that we do not even have the right to be surprised. Two years ago, as the current legal investigations – of which you are well aware – have shown, Community and non-Community citizens were kidnapped in European countries by the US secret services. Once again, however, we appear to be turning a blind eye.</p>
<p class="contents">We have noted your final comment, namely that if the episodes we are discussing today were proven, they would constitute serious violations of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. That, I believe, is an important statement and one we would ask you to develop further, by launching an exhaustive and in-depth investigation into the events we have been discussing this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The end does not justify the means. We must defend our values. We may be fighting terrorism, but we cannot do so with arms that are not democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand why US organisations and institutions, including the CIA, are being closely protected, especially in Eastern Europe, where so much hope for change has been pinned on the United States. However, not placing limits on the means we employ makes for a terrible contradiction, since democracy and transparency are fundamental to the maintenance of law and order and to democracy itself.

Today reports, although not yet confirmed, have nonetheless not been denied by the American authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am worried that, in the name of combating international terrorism, we are on the brink of a new Middle Ages. We are on the brink of a direct threat to democratic culture in Europe and, more importantly, the European governments and European institutions cannot remain impassive.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight in particular the direct reaction of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Unfortunately, we did not see this direct reaction by the Council of Europe on the part of the European Commission. Today, the guarantees and statements made by the competent Commissioner, Mr Frattini, were not in my opinion at all reassuring. What needs to be undertaken by the European Commission and by Mr Barroso, by Mr Frattini and by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, as the competent Commissioner for transatlantic relations, is an investigation in all directions, in order to ascertain where, by whom, how and when these black places were created.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a political and moral obligation to cooperate with the American Congress. We already know about the initiatives by Senators John MacKein and John Kerry in this direction. The same initiatives must also be taken by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of transatlantic relations is inseparably bound up with respect for democratic values and the principles of international law. This is a message which needs to be sent clearly to the American leadership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make two points in this respect. Such ‘secret CIA prisons’ operate outside of any judicial system. I refer not only to that implemented by international institutions, but also to the US courts, civil and military alike. This alone constitutes a violation of the fundamental democratic and liberal values upon which America, the European Union and the transatlantic alliance are founded.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great deal of public opposition to secret CIA prisons and the interrogation methods used in detention centres for suspected terrorists. This attitude is shared by many Republican politicians in the USA, as evidenced by Senator John McCain’s recent initiative to abolish the use of torture or methods akin to torture in such centres.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the possibility that secret CIA detention centres are located in EU Member States or in countries that will join the EU in the near future. This state of affairs undermines the fundamental principles of the EU Treaties. The European Union has every right to demand that its Member States, including my own country, Poland, take these accusations seriously, that they look into the matter again and that they investigate all the circumstances surrounding the landing in Poland of a CIA-owned Boeing carrying prisoners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is unanimity on the basic principle of the European Union, namely total respect for the life and dignity of every individual. Therefore, everyone here in Parliament agrees with the view that, if the allegations prove to be true, we shall be faced – as I have already said, but it is worth repeating – with a serious breach of the Treaty on European Union, a violation which, if it were confirmed and proven, could lead, as you all know, to the application of serious political sanctions against a Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is only the start, however, because it is obvious that, in addition to the serious violation – and I have drawn attention to Article 7 of the Treaty – there is also a second consideration: if these allegations proved to be true, they would constitute criminal activity. Someone mentioned this fact, a large number of you emphasised it and I am fully in agreement. It is therefore clear that the national legislatures of the Member States have the duty to investigate situations of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, as everyone is aware, an investigation is in progress into certain serious allegations of unlawful acts committed in Italy by CIA agents, which, if proven, would constitute a serious crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the problem is that legal means must be used if they give us every opportunity to achieve the result that we, both Commission and Parliament, are seeking. Let us therefore look at what actions the Commission has taken, is taking and will take in the future. Many of you asked this question and I may have failed to cover this point adequately in my introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the most appropriate way to describe it would be as a political action involving continuous requests to Member States and accession candidates. I am referring to possible actions such as debate and discussion with NGOs, which obviously have information they supplied to the media and which they could certainly provide to the Commission as well; also dialogue with other institutions that hold further items of evidence and with bodies able to supply information to the European Commission; and, finally, intense and continuous discussion with the authorities. I refer, in particular, to the United States Congress and Senate, which have decided to conduct investigations, the results of which could be passed on to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am not someone who minces words and I would ask you to forgive what is perhaps an excess of frankness. However, I believe that the indignation we all rightly feel at these serious crimes – these absolutely disgraceful situations – will not suffice to alter the rules of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">When some Members refer to an ‘investigation’, they are not just referring to the approach the Commission is intending to adopt – and will adopt – namely to conduct a political enquiry. They are also thinking of inspections, the taking of evidence and the obtaining of documents, even where such documents are not spontaneously volunteered. Even if Parliament voted that the Commission should exercise such investigative powers, it would be unable to do so, because the Treaties do not give it that authority.</p>
<p class="contents">When we use the word ‘investigation’, we need to understand what we are talking about. Do we have the power to question the Interior Ministers of the candidate countries and Member States referred to? No, we do not. Do we have the power to obtain classified CIA documents if they are not handed over? No, we do not. Do we have the powers of the Council of Europe? No, we do not have those powers. That would require a change in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be very happy if the European Constitution had already come into force, because it gives the European Commission wider powers than those it currently possesses. When someone here referred to the powers of national courts, they may have imagined that I have powers identical to those of a public prosecutor or examining magistrate in one of the Member States. However, there is no comparison between the power of a national judge and that of the European Commission. We may not like it, but those are the rules of the Treaties and, therefore, when we talk of an ‘investigation’ we need to use the word in its legal sense and, above all, within the meaning defined in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up: I intend to use all powers of political investigation, because these are permitted under the Treaties. We are allowed to ask the question, but if a Member State replies that it has never had clandestine jails in its territory, I shall need to have proof, as in the case of Abu Ghraib – photographs, evidence and testimonies. At present, we do not have these items. I am not saying we may not have them in future, but I do not have the authority to summon anyone, or to order the interrogation of someone who refuses to testify, because these powers are vested in other bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking, therefore, about a political investigation, an action aimed at obtaining information and collecting evidence, where it exists. Important information may also be obtained from Members of Parliament, of course, because these are political actions. They are not legal actions; they are actions which, if the allegations are proven, could lead to political sanctions. That is what complying with the rules means – and it is something I have always done, even when I may not have liked it. In this particular case, I do not like having limited powers, but these are the powers vested in me under the Treaties, and they are the political powers of investigation which I intend to use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
