<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, which has been taken over by Mrs Avilés Perea (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0141_EN.html">H-0141/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Human rights of women in Europe</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 19 January 2000, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe met to prepare a special session of the UN General Assembly due to take place on 5-9 June 2000 in New York to assess the situation of women five years on from the Beijing World Conference on Women, which adopted a platform for action to tackle the problems faced by women at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">During the proceedings, the Swiss Foreign Minister, Mrs Ruth Dreifuss, stated that 300 000 women were victims of trafficking in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council concur with that statement? Does it consider that the measures it is taking are sufficient to guarantee the safety and dignity of women in Europe in the face of the threat of trafficking? What additional measures will it take to counteract a probable deterioration in the situation arising from enlargement, given that the majority of victims are from countries applying for membership of the Union?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>.<span class="bold"> – </span><span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before going any further, I would like to remind you that the Member States of the European Union played a very important role in the Beijing Conference in 1995 and in preparing the Beijing Action Platform. Since the adoption of that platform, the European institutions and the Member States have been working hard to ensure that it is applied both at national and European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific question of trafficking in women, which is covered in the chapter on violence against women, the objectives are very clear. Various measures are to be taken by the governments of the countries of origin, transit and destination of the regional and international organisations, and Mrs Avilés Perea is quite right in drawing attention to the violation of women’s safety and dignity in Europe by the threat posed by trafficking. You may rest assured that the other institutions are taking this subject very seriously, and some measures have, in fact, already been taken to combat trafficking, and I would like to sum these up as briefly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, starting in November 1993, the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a series of recommendations on trade in human beings for prostitution, with a view to combating trafficking in human beings. Two years after that, this House took on this subject: apart from adopting a number of resolutions, it also produced a report and a resolution which specifically addressed trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission published an initial communication on trafficking in women and, in 1996, that is to say the year immediately after the Beijing Platform was adopted, it launched the STOP programme, with an annual budget of EUR 6.5 million. The importance of this programme should not be underestimated, given that it has helped to finance a great many projects and has proved to be genuinely effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, back in 1996, the Commission and the International Organisation for Migration organised an interdisciplinary conference in Vienna, which brought together representatives from Member States, the institutions, the European Union, the academic world, and various non-governmental organisations. A number of conclusions emerged from this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, also in 1996, the Council approved a common action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children. In 1997, the Ministerial Conference in The Hague resulted in The Hague Ministerial declaration on a European Code of Conduct to prevent and combat trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Lastly, in 1998, the Commission adopted a further communication on new measures to combat trafficking in women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that this issue is periodically considered under the transatlantic dialogue, because this phenomenon also affects countries like Canada and the United States, and is not limited to the area immediately adjacent to the European Union. We believe that it is increasingly important to exchange views with other destination countries so as to make a comparative assessment of this phenomenon and to establish a series of harmonised measures for controlling it.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue has, of course, been a regular agenda item in contacts with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe which are both transit countries and even the countries of origin for the great majority of this traffic. Campaigns are being financed under the PHARE programme in this field, some with support from the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that the Council does not wish to comment on the figure of 300 000 women falling victim to trafficking in Europe given by the Swiss Foreign Minister. There is no statistical data on this very specific subject, because we have to work with figures that are very difficult to obtain, given that we are talking about illegal immigration on the one hand and about illegal employment on the other, but it seems to us at first sight that this number is rather high. We think that an attempt should be made to assess this figure more accurately, and we should not get involved in commenting on an estimate of this kind, which does not seem to us to be well founded.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, this problem needs to be taken very seriously, not just because of the number of people involved, but also because trafficking in women is a form of organised crime that is evidently on the increase throughout the world, as it generates high profits in return for relatively low risks as far as the traffickers are concerned. Some of this trafficking is on a small scale, but there are also big international companies and networks behind a sophisticated and well-organised industry, with political support and economic resources in the countries of origin, transit and destination. This is why this question needs to be tackled at the highest level, and in particular in conjunction with the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Avilés Perea, you will certainly be aware that discussions are taking place on a protocol aimed at preventing, eliminating and punishing traffic in human beings, especially in women and children, which would complement the United Nations convention against organised crime. To this end, the Council recently adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate on this very protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union are also playing a very active role in the meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women which is preparing the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on women.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the Council continues to attach great importance to the issue of trafficking in women and children, and I hope that I have been able to allay some of your fears, Mrs Avilés Perea, at least in relation to the Council’s efforts in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the question stressed the fact that this is a problem which has recently become more serious, precisely because of the ease with which our borders can be crossed. This movement of people basically originates in the candidate countries of the East. The majority of cases involve women in illegal situations. This immigration is taking place in the worst possible conditions and these women are defenceless victims of every type of marginalisation and hardship.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that an effort has been made over recent years, but I must insist that it requires special attention now and we must prevent such problems in the future, since it is possible that this problem will become even more acute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that without questioning the need for the European Union to have a policy of tolerance on immigration and a policy of welcoming economic refugees, we should try, by following this route, to avoid creating mechanisms that make it easier to exploit women in particular and to develop forms of crime specifically associated with the free movement of persons. We believe that the work that has been done, and the increasing awareness on the part of the candidate countries of the need to work with the European Union during the pre-accession period to strengthen control mechanisms, combined with collaboration in this field, may yield concrete results. The Commission is paying particular attention to this subject, and I believe that the fact that during the Portuguese presidency various negotiating chapters linked with this – particularly in the field of justice and home affairs and freedom of movement – are to be opened with the Luxembourg phase candidate countries may help to create a common culture, a common culture that the candidate countries will later on have to share in terms of respecting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are issues that the Romanian authorities say they are taking very seriously and, as far as I could ascertain, they consider that they stem from a cultural situation affecting certain sections of the population.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 2 February the Commission told the EP that it intends to monitor Austria, following the entry of the FPÖ into government, pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution of 3 February 2000 the EP 'calls on the Council and Commission to be prepared, in the event of any violation of the principles of fundamental rights laid out in Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, to take action under Article 7 of the Treaty..'. </p>

<p class="contents">Can the Council rule out the possibility that the facts outlined above constitute serious and persistent violations of fundamental rights as defined in Article 6 of the TEU and, if so, for what reasons?

We have to recognise that the Austrian situation in particular, and the issues raised in this question concerning Italy and Belgium, are quite different from what is envisaged in Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam – and it is very important to make this point, as the Treaties are breaking fresh ground here – states that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. Although we all know that the European Union is not a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the same article compensates for this by stating that the European Union respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Article 7, which is in fact a Portuguese proposal that I was able to present to the Reflection Group which prepared the previous Intergovernmental Conference, this article establishes a specific mechanism, and this is the point to which the honourable Member’s question refers, for taking action against any Member State which seriously and persistently breaches the principles mentioned in the previous article, Article 6. And this action may lead to the suspension of this Member State’s rights as a member of the European Union. This mechanism goes back to an idea originally put forward in the Spinelli report in 1984, and it is linked with the need to guard against breaches of democratic principles within a Member State, and in particular against actions that may infringe the principles of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the facts that Mr Dupuis refers to in his question do not represent a violation of any of the principles mentioned in Article 6 of the Treaty. This article should not be invoked with a view to any type of interference in the administration of the home affairs of Member States, particular in the field of justice. The existence of a violation of a principle mentioned in Article 6 must – and this is also an important point and the reason why no mechanism has been brought into play – be determined by the Council acting on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the Commission and after obtaining the assent of the European Parliament. As this procedure has not been invoked by any of the bodies with this right of initiative, this situation does not, in our view, constitute a matter covered by Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Council statement made on 2 February, I would like to repeat, as I was the one who presented this declaration in this House, that it was made by the Council Presidency, but on behalf of 14 Member States, and of course the consequences of that statement and of its content as regards relations with Austria are only binding on each Member State on a bilateral basis. They do not bind the Council and they do not affect the free and normal functioning of the Community institutions, in which Austria is still participating in full. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fundamental point that we have to bear in mind here is that whilst Europe has made enormous progress in economic terms, as regards the single market and the single currency, nothing or next to nothing has been done in the field of justice and home affairs. We still have an almost purely national framework for justice, although certain situations are in practice clearly of a transnational nature. We constantly find ourselves having to deal with this contradiction, particularly as regards the rights of the child, an area where there are cases in which more than one country is involved and in which the victims are not only not notified by the state where the judgement is made, but are also deprived of legal support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to the development of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I think it is important for us to bear in mind that transfers of power have taken place, and that further transfers of power remain to be made over the next five years from what was the old third pillar to the first pillar of the Union, particularly as regards visas, judicial cooperation in civil matters and customs cooperation. We still have judicial cooperation in criminal matters under the third pillar, but at the moment we are working towards establishing a European area of freedom, security and justice, and we hope that the Commission can respond to this by presenting a scoreboard giving us a catalogue of pertinent measures.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would like to stress that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights that is being discussed will very probably help to strengthen these new aspects and will certainly help to give the European Union a more solid body of legally arguable principles, which some of us, and the Council in particular, would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your question about Austria, I would like to repeat what I said about Austria’s compliance with Articles 6 and 7 up to now. It was good to hear you talking about an “ad hoc decision” as it is clear that this was an ad hoc decision, and one taken by the 14 Member States regarding their relations with the Austrian Government. What was at issue was not the Austrian Government’s conduct, but its political make-up. During an earlier debate I said that we are now all Austrians within the European Union, and I would like to repeat that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all Austrians because the European Union is a single entity in terms of rights and citizenship, and I would like to have the same rights in Austria that Austrian citizens should have in my country. So I do not like to be taught any lessons by a party which behaves in a racist and xenophobic way, and makes racist and xenophobic statements which it seems to me give us every reason to be concerned. These concerns are at present being expressed in a bilateral political framework rather than at European Union level, because there would only be scope for a decision at European Union level if there were an infringement of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which means that, for the future, Mr Rübig, we will have to assess to what extent the Austrian Freedom Party can make a break with its past ideology, because that is crucial. It is important for the Freedom Party to clarify if it is still adhering to the principles described in its previous statements, and in particular the kinds of individuals through which those statements were made, because otherwise I cannot see any other solution except for the other Member States to continue to have the same kinds of reservations about their relations with the Austrian Government, with all the consequences that flow from that. And, as I said, this would be a purely bilateral matter. The Austrians have every right to whatever government they want – but we have every right to our opinions about the Austrian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I never said that the Austrian Government is a racist government, let me make that quite clear. I know people in the current Austrian Government who I have worked with in the past and who I hope to carry on working with in the future, who are a long way from being associated with any kind of racist ideology. What I am saying in very clear terms is that this government includes a party, some of whose leaders have not only made extremely serious racist and xenophobic statements, but have even proposed domestic legislation clearly inspired by racist ideology. And the Freedom Party has not as yet made any statement totally repudiating its association with ideologies of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other question you have raised, the answer is yes. Any country can disassociate itself from the declaration made by the 14 countries. We are talking about 14 free countries which freely made the decision, on a purely bilateral basis, to demonstrate to Austria their displeasure at the make-up of its government, but any of these countries could pull out of this joint arrangement whenever it wishes. The same freedom that led them to stand together could lead them to part company tomorrow if they had a different view of developments in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">You also asked, Mrs Kauppi, when the Council will allow the Austrian people to escape from this pressure. First of all, there is no Council decision. As I have already said, we are talking about 14 countries. This is not a European Union issue. I would like to make it clear that Austria has been totally involved and will continue to be one hundred per cent involved in all the formal workings of the European Union’s institutions. Mrs Kauppi, you cannot expect some members of governments within the European Union to be happy about sitting alongside people who they consider to be apologists for ideologies which clearly remind them of another period in history and which raise old European ghosts. Different individuals will have different perceptions of all this. I personally do not like sitting alongside fascists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This measure was intended to send a message of support to democratic forces and to encourage those within the Republic of Yugoslavia who, despite the adverse conditions they face, are committed to an approach in keeping with the defence of democratic rights and to policies in the interests of the people of Yugoslavia. This programme started with two local authorities where the opposition held power. The European Union subsequently decided, acting on proposals from various Member States, to extend this system to five other municipalities. This is a complex process involving substantial budget commitments, and the Commission has made a great effort here to find the funds needed to extend this system. We hope that this signal from the European Union will be heard by democratic forces in Serbia. We deeply regret the need to maintain energy sanctions against Yugoslavia, but they form part of a set of measures identified to exert pressure on the regime there, and in particular they represent a form of pressure on the way Mr Milosevic is running the country. We are aware that this obviously has an impact on the civilian population. But we have to recognise that the political situation in Yugoslavia and the way in which Mr Milosevic is continuing to behave at international level justify maintaining these sanctions, and this remains the unanimous view of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to stress that work is currently being done through consular cooperation between Member States with a view to monitoring and safeguarding the interests and rights of the citizens of any Member State in third countries, particularly as regards the possibility of their being condemned to death.</p>
<p class="contents">For this precise purpose, and in all cases where a citizen of a Member State is threatened with the death penalty in a third country, there is now a coordination mechanism allowing combined approaches to be made to the governments of third countries by the European Union missions in those countries. This cooperation between the missions of Member States will also cover information sharing on citizens who may be threatened with the death penalty. We will therefore, in due course, be able to give a concrete reply to this question, and to obtain specific and up-to-date information, but this will naturally depend on progress made with the consular cooperation that the European Union is trying to build up.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It did not reply within the time period laid down and is replying now, orally, two months late.</p>

Do you not think that this is rather difficult for the European citizens to understand?</p>

The first concerns the reply and the time the Council has taken to provide it. As you know, this is a procedural matter and involves deadlines set unilaterally by the European Parliament. The Council was not involved in approving those deadlines, has never accepted them, and it is accordingly the Council’s policy to reiterate this point on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific point you are making, I recognise that you are perfectly right and that this is an issue which should be included in the agenda for work in this area as soon as possible. Your comments make perfect sense. The European Union is indeed, as you have said, a world power, and it is establishing various instruments and mechanisms to strengthen its position and to properly protect the rights of its citizens in other countries. You will also be aware that consular cooperation within the European Union is a recent development. A systematic approach for consular cooperation and for coordinated consular action has only been developed in the last few years. I presume that there are delays, and I believe that you are quite right, and the pressure being brought to bear on the Council on this subject is welcome as far as I am concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This article provides that agreements or contracts with third countries shall be negotiated by the Commission in accordance with the directives of the Council, and are to be concluded by the Commission with the approval of the Council, which shall act by a qualified majority. It is for the Council to respect and apply the relevant provisions of the Euratom Treaty, which does not provide for the Parliament to be consulted on these matters, which is how the Treaties stand.</p>
<p class="contents">You will recall that as an institution, the Council is not empowered to make any amendments to the Treaty, which is quite natural, as questions of this kind can normally only be raised at an Intergovernmental Conference. In my role as chairman of the preparatory group for the ICG, I will make sure to take account of this request regarding the ICG.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to your questions about the nuclear power stations in Ukraine, whose names I find rather difficult to read – Khmelnitsky and Rivne – may I remind you that is it for the Commission to carry out technical assessments of these nuclear power stations so as to determine what maintenance is required, or even closure. In March 1994, the Council approved a decision authorising the Commission to contract Euratom loans of up to EUR 1 100 million in order to contribute to the financing required for improving the degree of efficiency and safety of nuclear power stations in certain non-member countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no non-member country has made use of this facility to date. Furthermore, the legal basis for this is the Euratom Treaty, so that there is once again no provision for consulting the European Parliament. To sum up, your questions raise some sensitive problems which, as we know, have been discussed in this House in recent years in the context of increasing its powers, and Parliament has been using its budgetary authority as a legitimate source of pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific instance of KEDO, let me remind you that in 1998 Parliament blocked the funds for that year, and it was only possible to overcome this problem by means of a compromise with the Commission, in which the Commission undertook to inform Parliament, at the beginning of each year, about Euratom agreements being negotiated, so that Parliament could consider them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although this position has been explicitly welcomed in the ICG, there are some Member States who advocate a case-by-case approach on the use of the codecision procedure, even where legislative decisions are concerned. With regard to ratification of international agreements, I have already been able to raise this issue at the ICG, and when it was first discussed this request and traditional position of the European Parliament did not receive what might be called a ready welcome from the Member States. Although this item is still on the table, as all these issues are kept on the agenda until the end of the conference, it does seem to us at this stage that there is unlikely to be any significant progress on this. Nevertheless, we will continue to maintain a dialogue with the European Parliament on this subject. Next Tuesday I shall be attending a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs at which I will make sure to discuss this issue and to explain in a little more detail how the ICG preparatory group is dealing with questions like this, and in particular the list of requests and proposals presented by the European Parliament, which we hope will be supplemented by the resolution to be voted upon on 23 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How exactly do things stand? During the occupation, the German Government forced the Greek Government to give it a loan, which today, with interest and inflation, totals some USD 25 billion. This loan was signed and sealed and represents an obligation. The point at issue, to get to the crux of the matter, is a transaction between two Member States of the European Union and the Council of Europe cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that Germany is clearly using its power to refuse to honour its commitments. It collects every last cent of the loans which it grants.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue is the tremendous damage caused by Germany’s occupying forces in Greece. This comes to some USD 40 billion. Other countries have been paid. Greece has not. Why? Of course, the Greek Governments bear some responsibility, but at some point all this needs to be analysed. Germany has acknowledged its obligation from time to time. However, it has failed to honour it on various pretexts. Now there are no longer any excuses and it is duty-bound to pay and the Council cannot wash its hands.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Support for European films</span></p>
<p class="contents">European films are highly important to the cultural diversity and the cultural heritage both of the individual countries and of Europe. 80 to 90% of the films showing in Sweden are, however, American. Up to 50% state aid for film production is allowed in the EU at present. The Commission is said to be considering lowering the limit for State aid, i.e. to reduce the exemption for cultural support to a maximum of 30%. This would be a threat to European film production, as producing films is expensive and commercially very risky, especially in smaller countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council agree that State aid is important to promote European culture? Does the Council not consider it important to encourage diversed European film production?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the Council understands that as part of its programme, the Commission is holding discussions with Member States on this very subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to explain that at national level this type of support is a matter for Member States, within certain legal limits laid down in the Treaty. On the other hand, the existing MEDIA II programme and the future MEDIA-PLUS programme provide complementary financial assistance with a view to strengthening the presence of European cinema. This is one of the key steps the European Union has been taking in order to maintain and protect its cultural diversity and forms part of the guidelines contained in its own position in relation to the WTO negotiations, in particular as regards the audiovisual industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to say that there is an enormous difference between, for example, producing cars or lorries and producing a film. We are aware that film production is dependent on aid, as it is a combination of culture and commercial production. We also know that European film, particularly when produced in languages with few speakers, cannot easily maintain as large a film production as one would wish. Therefore, aid for both national and European film production is extremely important, as is the opportunity to continue the practice of accepting up to 50 percent State aid for film production.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to ask the Council's representative whether he does not consider it important, with the help of this practice, to be able to give up to 50 percent in aid to the production of European film in those languages with few speakers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also concerned about this. As you know, in the past all the Member States of the Union were authorised to provide special support for their film industries, particularly bearing in mind the specific need for cultural diversity within the European Union and because it was necessary to ensure that account was taken of this specific need, thus going beyond a purely economic view of the film industry. We hope that it will be possible to maintain this support in future, and we also hope that this can be totally reconciled with the new WTO rules, especially in the new round which we hope will start sooner or later.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there is still a 50% limit on state aid in relation to the overall cost of any given project, but this percentage could even be raised to 60% in special cases envisaged in the programme. At the moment we have no indication that the Commission is considering a lowering of this limit, let alone the amount and the percentage mentioned by the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we went down that path we would certainly be entering very dangerous territory. This does not mean that the idea behind this question does not make some sense politically speaking: in some countries, including my own, a Nazi or fascist party does not have the right to register with the constitutional court. This means that it cannot be accepted as a legitimate party in the democratic process. Other countries have different systems and these have just as many virtues as my own. What we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader Community, no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens. We are all European citizens and we are all citizens of a European Union which is underpinned, politically speaking, by a basic set of principles. If these principles are at risk, we have the right – and the duty – to sound the alarm. But whether lists of parties are desirable or otherwise, I hope that this never becomes a matter for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because Austria has a county mayor in Klagenfurt who has expressed himself in a way for which you and I feel equal revulsion, you have punished a country with sanctions and you are punishing a people with sanctions, including those individuals who may have voted against the party in question, and this without specifying what their crime entails. Up until now, it is only opinions you are punishing and not actions. If it were a question of actions, it would perhaps be Denmark which should be punished for a ban on immigrants of a kind which the FPÖ has not been able to put into practice. It is therefore opinions which you have punished and not actions. I should therefore like to know, when I next vote, if Portugal and other countries – outside the Council – will wish to propose sanctions against my country in the event, for example, of the present Danish government’s incorporating ministers from the Socialist People’s Party or Unity List, which are both opposed to Economic and Monetary Union, or if they will wish to prevent the appointment of a government including Fogh Rasmussen from the Left party if he relies upon support from the Danish People’s Party which, in many newspapers, is described as a party equivalent to the FPÖ in Austria. Knowing the answer to these questions would be useful as a guide to the consumer, but it may well be that the action taken by the 14 Prime Ministers is a source of regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The attitude adopted by some Member States towards the Austrian Government related to their negative perception of the new Austrian Government, which does not affect the Community framework. We are not working at Council level here. The European Union has not taken a single discriminatory measure against Austria. These 14 Member States decided of their own free will to make plain to the Austrian authorities their displeasure at the kind of government they had established, and above all at the fact that they had included in the government a party which advocates, or has advocated in the past – it is difficult to distinguish between the past and the present in the Freedom Party’s statements – a certain ideology and a certain way of interpreting European values. However, Mr Bonde, you should not, of course, confuse economic and monetary union with Nazism, they are in fact slightly different. Of course, all parties have every right to oppose economic and monetary union, the Schengen Agreement, or anything else; they can even oppose the European Union itself. As you know, there are parties which are opposed to the European Union, but that does not mean that they should be seen as undemocratic. The fact is, and you know this as well as I do, Mr Bonde, that there are parties which promote ideologies which jeopardise the system itself and which affect the set of values which are the very essence of the European Union, which are ultimately part of the justification for creating the European Union in the first place. It is therefore quite natural, Mr Bonde, that certain governments should feel somewhat uneasy. This uneasiness is only being reflected in bilateral relations. We are not confusing Community matters with bilateral matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the case of definitive legislative acts approved by the Council, the reports include the results of any votes, and any statements for the minutes made by the Council, the Commission and the Member States. However, the only authentic texts are, of course, definitively approved minutes from which extracts are published by the General Secretariat of the Council on the Internet via the EUDOR web site, which is managed by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, under “Transparency of the Council’s legislative activities”. This is in fact one of the achievements of the much maligned Treaty of Amsterdam which people need to be regularly reminded about.</p>
<p class="contents">After each meeting of the Council, a press release is issued which contains information on decisions taken by the Council. This indicates for which decisions statements for the minutes were authorised for release to the public and which are obtainable from the Press Service. It is also possible to obtain information on the legislative transparency of the Council by e-mail.</p>
<p class="contents">The public’s right of access to Council documents is covered by Article 255 of the Treaty, which stipulates that the Council shall determine general principles and limits for exercising this right within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It should be borne in mind that this provision of the Treaty of Amsterdam makes it possible for the various institutions to regulate access to their own documents, and we need to be aware of this, given the particularly delicate nature of certain issues under discussion in highly sensitive fields, such as the common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. These provisions need to reflect a number of concerns which, whilst preserving the rules of transparency, cannot be allowed to turn transparency into a means of making any Council activity totally ineffective. For this reason, as I have already said, this article stipulates that the rules of procedure of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should contain specific provisions regarding access to their documents. This issue comes under the general transparency rules of the European institutions which were, in fact, defined in the conclusions of the last European Council, in Helsinki, and I quote, as “an important element in bringing the Union closer to its citizens and improving efficiency”. </p>
<p class="contents">During the Finnish presidency, substantial progress was made in the field of access to documents by means of modern information technology, and in particular the Internet. Furthermore, a Council Decision on improving the provision of information relating to the Council's legislative activities and the public register of Council documents was approved. In accordance with this decision, and let me quote once again, “The General Secretariat of the Council shall make accessible to the public a list of the items on the provisional agendas of meetings of the Council and its preparatory bodies referring to cases where the Council acts in its legislative capacity”. The current presidency has been following this practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision stipulates that the public register of Council documents shall also include references to the document number and the subject matter of classified documents, with the exception of cases where disclosure of this information could undermine protection of the public interest, protection of the individual and of privacy, protection of commercial and industrial secrecy, protection of the Community's financial interests, and/or protection of confidentiality as requested by the natural or legal person who supplied any of the information contained in the document or as required by the legislation of the Member State which supplied any of that information.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, the Portuguese presidency has declared its commitment to initiate discussions on public access to documents and its intention to entrust this dossier to the “Friends of the Presidency” group as soon as the Commission presented the proposal for a regulation on public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. This proposal was presented to the Commission, in the College of Commissioners, on 26 January, and, as I have said, it attempts to fulfil the objectives of increasing transparency, and in particular proposes significant amendments to the 1999 Code of Conduct. The presidency immediately initiated discussion of the proposal, which was presented at the Coreper meeting on 2 February and which was examined at two subsequent meetings. This set of tasks has therefore, Mr President, been developed by the Council on the basis of Commission proposals which I believe suggest a real will to increase the transparency of this work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Member States, there are legislative powers associated with parliaments in which debates are held openly and in public, and there are legislative powers which, either because they are delegated by parliament or as a matter of law, are a matter for the government. Discussion of legislative proposals within the government is not in the public domain, but the result of these legislative proposals is in the public domain, whether they come before parliament or not. At European Union level, I do not believe that we can go any further than the existing provisions, that is to say making the results of discussions in the Council public, and in particular making public the way Member States voted and explanations of votes and statements for the minutes. I think that I have said enough on this subject now but, as I have said, this is my personal view, given that this is basically about the underlying philosophy of the European Union’s legislative procedures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But my actual question concerns the fact that the President of the European Commission, Mr Prodi, has sent a letter to the European Parliament criticising the Parliamentary Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, for having taken part in a public debate and wanting various documents to be widely accessible, as well as having presented his own point of view that there should be more public access to documents in the EU. I would ask the representative of the Council whether he thinks the President of the Commission’s action was right and justified, and whether the Council also wants to restrict the Ombudsman’s freedom of speech on this topic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, if that was how Parliament saw things, we could even give not twenty, but thirty answers to honourable Members’ questions. But I shall reply in 15 seconds, omitting the detail which would reflect the presidency’s desire to deal more thoroughly with questions and to go as far as possible in giving specific replies to honourable Members’ concerns. But we can also opt for a bureaucratic, officious, quick, artificial and probably unsatisfactory answer. We would then – in quantitative terms – be more successful in giving answers to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been here since 9 o’clock in the morning and I do not think that the Council can be accused of not doing a serious job in answering honourable Members’ questions. With regard to your question about this disagreement between Parliament and the Commission, it is obvious that the Council would be the last institution to get involved in this disagreement and will leave those two institutions to sort out this potential argument between them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
