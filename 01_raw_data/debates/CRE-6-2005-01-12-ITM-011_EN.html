Discussions on debt relief for the countries seriously affected by the disaster in the Indian Ocean are going on in Paris. Relief of this sort must be on a substantial scale and be implemented rapidly. I might mention, incidentally, that the Paris Club is meeting today to discuss the possibility of a moratorium on the debts of the countries that want such relief.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us acknowledge, though, that the situation of Iraq, which gave rise to this question and this debate, is quite specific and quite exceptional. The debt relief for the Republic of Iraq, and I would call it substantial debt relief, which was decided on by the Paris Club in November, is without doubt indispensable if the country’s economy is to be rebuilt, and also if a sovereign Iraq with democratic and legitimate institutions is to be reborn.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the question of the relief needed, as I have just said, for Iraq’s debts, also arises – and, let me say, with the same urgency – with reference to the least developed countries. It would be incomprehensible, not to say absurd, for debt relief to be granted only to a country that had fallen victim to a natural disaster or to conflict. Absolute poverty itself gives rise to real disasters on a daily basis, in the shape of malnutrition, chronic illiteracy, high rates of infant mortality, AIDS, and more besides. It stands in the way of development and promotes all sorts of conflicts causing thousands, indeed millions of deaths, which the media often ignore and pass over in silence.</p>
<p class="contents">We see, then, that the relief of the poorest countries’ debts is at the heart of the fight against poverty as well as of support for a policy aimed at eradicating it and of the relaunch of a development process in line with the millennium objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">A high level of debt and a debt burden no longer in proportion to a country’s economic capacity hamper any prospect of development and lead, paradoxically, not to the hoped-for economic upturn, but to the rampant destitution of the poorest countries’ populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this state of affairs, the European Union has not been inactive, nor will it be so in the future. The Monterrey conference saw it make practical commitments, the potential revision of which will be debated at the April General Affairs and External Relations Council. Its efforts at relieving the debts of less developed countries took practical form in the HIPC (High Indebted Poor Countries) initiative, which was proposed by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996 and reinforced in 1999. This is a coordinated approach aimed at bringing the poorest countries’ debts down to a sustainable level, including not only public, bilateral and multilateral debt, but also trading debt. This initiative has the potential to help forty-two countries, thirty-eight of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. The results achieved to date are positive but, as yet, insufficient. Little impact has been had on trading debt. Around 60% of the HIPC initiative’s funding was provided by the European Union. A number of creditors have not yet done anything about relieving the debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom’s forthcoming presidency of both G8 and the EU has made debt relief for the least developed countries a priority objective. We want to work closely with the United Kingdom, thus enabling the European Union to develop a coherent and ambitious approach in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Debt relief must continue to be one of the priority objectives of the EU’s cooperation and development policy. It cannot be addressed in isolation from other policies: trade policy, including the adoption of a new generalised preference system, positive conclusions from the Doha round that are favourable to developing countries, increased development aid concentrating on the eradication of poverty, support for good governance, and the settlement and prevention of conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we all agree that for some developing countries external indebtedness is a major obstacle for growth and development. We should acknowledge the merits of the debt relief initiative currently applied, the Highly Indebted Poor Countries – or HIPC –Initiative, which was launched in 1996. This is the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever taken. It will reduce the debt burden of the highly indebted poor countries by approximately two-thirds, demonstrating a commitment to poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States have gone beyond the HIPC requirements. Most Member States have committed themselves to cancelling 100% of the bilateral claims. The Commission has done the same for all special loans in least developed countries eligible for HIPC debt relief. However, it is now widely recognised that HIPC relief will fail to ensure long-term debt sustainability. It is clear that more needs to be done for the poor countries that benefit from the HIPC Initiative. Pressure is increasing to extend debt relief to the other developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank and the IMF are developing a new framework for long-term debt sustainability in low-income countries. This should help to prevent the accumulation of new debt. The Commission is following this debate closely to ensure the transparency of the decision-making process. The Paris Club of creditor governments has developed the so-called Evian approach to deal with non-HIPC countries. It takes into account debt sustainability considerations, allowing the Paris Club to adopt its response to the financial situation of the debtor country and to make the resolution of crises more orderly, timely and predictable. One application of these new rules was the Iraqi case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not <span class="italic">a priori</span> against debt relief in favour of middle-income countries. It supports the Evian approach of the Paris Club, which looks at the financial situation of each country rather than defining standard terms as has been done in the case of Iraq. Iraq is not indebted to the Commission but, as a sign of solidarity with the Iraqi people, the Community pledged a contribution of EUR 200 million to the Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq at the Madrid Conference. However, the Commission does not want assistance for Iraq, whether through debt relief or other mechanisms, to be given at the expense of the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, the UK and the US have both called for 100% cancellation of multilateral debt for low-income countries, although with different approaches towards its financing. The proposal of full cancellation may appear attractive, but it entails risks in terms of aid allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's finance study demonstrates that the HIPC Initiative has already distorted the allocation of aid because the levels of debt relief are not related indicators of poverty, nor – and this is very important – do they reflect performance in tackling poverty. The countries benefiting most from the initiative are by no means the best performers or the poorest countries within the group.</p>
<p class="contents">Some examples will illustrate my point. The country benefiting most on a per capita basis from HIPC debt relief is Guyana, with USD 769 per capita received. It ranks 92nd in the Human Development Index. However, Niger, which ranks 174th in that index, receives only USD 48 per capita relief.</p>
<p class="contents">The total cancellation of debt for all African countries would lead to considerable inequalities in the distortion of aid among them, measured by their relative poverty levels. Eritrea – one of the poorest countries in Africa – would receive USD 56 per capita, while the Seychelles, one of the richest countries of the continent, would receive USD 2 572 per capita, which makes a huge difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Further debt relief could lead to further distortions in aid allocation. In a world of limited resources, debt relief granted to middle-income countries should not detract from the amounts available to the neediest ones.</p>
<p class="contents">So, debt relief is a bad aid allocation mechanism, but it can be a good way of delivering aid, as it provides a quick method of disbursement, ensuring a predictable flow of resources directly into the budget with limited transaction costs.</p>
<p class="contents">It could also be used to protect vulnerable, low-income countries from the effect of exogenous shocks. In these cases, some sort of temporary relief of the debt could help mitigate the adverse effects of external shocks on the poverty-reduction strategies of beneficiary countries. That is also the case as regards the moratoriums, which, as already mentioned, were discussed today by the presidency in Paris in relation to the tsunami-affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, debt relief is not a panacea which by itself creates new resources, nor does it automatically translate into services for poor people or economic growth. However, it may be an effective way to deliver support and a good way to provide swift assistance after shocks. To tackle poverty and to attain the Millennium Development Goals, the real challenge is to ensure appropriate levels of development financing. We need to reach agreement on new and sufficiently ambitious targets for official development assistance by 2009 for us to have a real prospect of attaining those goals. Debt relief can be a useful tool in that quest, but it can by no means offer a really full response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad to see the debt burden high on the agenda. Debt relief is one of the millennium objectives for development. Interest charges often weigh down heavily on the budgets of the developing countries, and, in some cases, cripple further development.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have to look into what can be done about this, the subject is a complex one and does not lend itself to impulsive action. I can imagine that for the countries affected by the tsunami, a freeze will be granted for payment of interest and redemption, but in general, debt relief should not be dependent on incidental tragic events.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a difference between cancelling and relieving debt. Our group is not in favour of general cancellation of all debts, which some in this House advocate. We say ‘yes’ to debt relief, but only where it is necessary, only for the poorest countries and always subject to conditions. What we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have contributed to a resolution is a statement to which, indeed, the Commissioner has made reference: debt relief is not a panacea against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that the amount that will possibly be written off will be deducted from the amounts available for development cooperation. Debt relief alone does not offer a country new sources of income, neither builds schools or hospitals nor reduces poverty in those countries; on its own, it provides no incentive for further development, the funds available for which will be considerably smaller after debt cancellation. Where the development of a country is concerned, an important part of the responsibility lies with the country itself. Debt relief makes sense only if it goes hand in hand with good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, and investment in the country’s own population; in short, if the money actually ends up with the poorest. Debt relief cannot, then, be a goal in itself; it is meaningful only if it is actually an incentive for development. Then we can be generous, but – as is the case in all forms of development aid – that generosity cannot be unconditional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I am glad to see this, these are reactions in the heat of the moment, associated with a pressing current situation, and it is the debt problem of the global south as a whole that must be treated with the same urgency and speed, for this disturbing reality with which we are faced is indeed urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of debt repaid by the South in a year far exceeds the annual total of public development aid, and it is the South that is funding the North. Over twenty years, the countries of the South will have already repaid six euros for every euro borrowed and they will still be being asked for another four. If the South is to make progress, its debts must be cut back, and, today, practical responses are only slowly forthcoming. I welcome the United Kingdom’s initiative, it having announced its intention of cancelling its share in the debt incurred by the poorest countries to the World Bank, and I am impatient to see the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole do likewise. Were they all to follow the British example, 45 million more children would be able to go to school, 140 million people would be able to have access to clean drinking water – provided, of course, that the amount of cancelled debt was added to the current development aid, and provided that the North stopped taking with one hand what it gives with the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, it is imperative that a global, fair and sustainable solution be found to the problem of debt, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is persuaded that it is the European Union and its Member States that can take the initiative in this. They can do this by writing off all the poorest countries’ debts, by taking measures to alleviate the position of threshold countries, by no longer imposing ‘structural adjustments’ as conditions and, of course, as has been said, we have to make this part of an all-round aid policy and, with all haste, seek new sources of finance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital that even as we pay necessary and proper attention to tsunami relief, we also remain focused on the wider and longer-term issue of poverty reduction and the millennium development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Debt relief is key to achieving the millennium development goals. In the past, the measure used to calculate whether debt was sustainable was a calculation of debt payment against export income, but the really crucial question is how much of the national budget is being used to repay debt. In many African countries, debt service payments still take up a larger share of the budget than health services. In Ghana, for example, 11% of government spending goes into repaying debt, while only 9% is spent on health.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want debt relief to contribute to achieving the millennium development goals, then we need to acknowledge that debt is unsustainable wherever it prevents a country financing its poverty reduction programmes. It follows that international money to fund debt relief must be in addition to, and not instead of, aid. I am very concerned that the United States envisages a reduction in aid budgets to fund debt cancellation. In fact, debt cancellation needs to go hand-in-hand with an increase in aid and the ALDE resolution includes a renewed pledge that Member States give 0.7% of GDP as overseas development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">It also follows that debt reduction can only contribute to achieving the millennium development goals if it takes place under good governance. Nothing will be achieved if the money saved through debt relief is spent by a corrupt dictator on expensive palaces or, even worse, on attack helicopters to terrorise a section of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of developing countries have a responsibility to invest in their own people, but we in the European institutions have a responsibility to make sure that flexible mechanisms for debt relief are available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is made clear by two figures; firstly, a great many of the poorest countries are forced to spend over 40% of their GNP on debt servicing. In such circumstances, independent economic growth becomes all but impossible, and this is why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for every euro we now give in development aid to the countries of the South, an average of nearly EUR 1.50 is paid back to the countries of the North in interest payments. This is another reason why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative; given that Indonesia, the country we are currently debating, would have to pay back EUR 4 billion this year, it is abundantly clear that this would immediately cancel out any kind of development or disaster aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I was therefore delighted to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say today that he was in favour of full debt cancellation for Indonesia. We need an international conference on debt relief, but the Paris Club, being no more than a meeting of creditors, is incapable of staging one. We need an international conference in which participants include creditor countries and debtor countries, as well as civil societies which have been affected and which would act as monitoring bodies, with all participants having equal rights. Both the European Union and this House should lend their support to the holding of such a conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to contradict you on one point, Mr Potočnik; you quoted absolute per capita figures, yet such figures are not the decisive factor. Every inhabitant of Brandenburg, my home, is in debt to the tune of EUR 16 000, but our national economy is structured in such a way that we can cope with it. The national economies of the developing countries cannot cope with such debt, however. In my opinion, therefore, the main issue at stake is not whether we grant a debt deferment, debt reduction, debt moratorium or suchlike, but whether debts are cancelled, as these countries need the money that at present they spend almost exclusively on interest – not even on repayment – to tackle their economic, social and environmental problems. We would be helping them to help themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who thinks that this would cripple the rich industrial nations should take note of the fact that the Iraq war costs the USA USD 150 million every day. President Bush has asked Congress for a further USD 80 billion, and yet Pakistan’s debts run to a mere USD 11 billion. A comparison of these figures makes it obvious that the debt could be cancelled entirely, and this must be our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is often said – and I have heard it said again in this House today – that debt is offset by development aid. I am sorry, but if the political will is there, and if we genuinely wish to help these countries, the poorest countries’ debt must be cancelled entirely. In addition, the rich countries must finally adhere to their voluntary commitment of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid. Such an example should really be set for these countries and for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The external debt burden of developing countries is an insurmountable problem. It makes it impossible to reduce the proportion of the population living in utter poverty. Having understood this, the European Union has already earmarked USD one million for debt relief.</p>
<p class="contents">The HIPC Initiative encompassed 42 of the world's poorest countries. The amount of debt to be written off for 26 of these countries will be 50% or USD 25 billion. Other financial instruments will also be used.</p>
<p class="contents">These and other measures, however, are still insufficient to decrease the external debt burden of poor countries. Therefore new opportunities and focused measures must be sought. A broader spectrum of countries should be given the opportunity of qualifying for debt relief, similar to Iraq. Debt Relief International should be more closely involved, and a real opportunity to escape from economic stagnation should be provided, moving purposefully towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the decision made two hours ago by the members of the Paris Club to grant three countries affected by the tsunami a moratorium on their debt repayments. This comes after the agreement in November 2004 to cancel 80% of Iraq’s foreign debt, as a tangible sign of support for the reconstruction of that country. Furthermore, the examination by the Extraordinary General Affairs and External Relations Council, which met last week, of the follow-up measures for the affected countries – such as trade support and bilateral partnerships – had a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">My greatest hope, however, is to be able to see a similar commitment not only at times of war or natural disaster but on a continuous basis for those countries where conflict, epidemics and hunger are unfortunately on their daily agenda. According to the United Nations, in fact, there are at least 14 forgotten crises, most of them affecting African countries, for which the United Nations has requested support worth USD 1.7 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of those and other developing countries, we have to aim at fully achieving the Millennium Objectives, something that we are still far from doing, as well as reducing or cancelling their debt, if possible.

I am somewhat disappointed at the Commission’s statements, however, which did not go anywhere near far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Schmit that it should not only be the countries affected by the terrible natural disaster that are considered when talking of the implications of foreign debt. It is not only natural disasters which affect countries; it is also the devastating effects of poverty, which is on the rise throughout the world, as well as the fact that the amount spent by many countries on debt servicing is many times greater than that on social expenditure, and the fact that we are a very long way from meeting the Millennium Development Goals agreed on by all UN members.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently all very proud of our unprecedented readiness to make donations and provide assistance. I believe that we are entitled to be proud, but – and this is a point I should like to make to the Commission – we must not give a little with one hand and take away a lot with the other. The relevant figures have already been cited, and we must also ask ourselves whether it is morally justifiable, and compatible with good governance, for poor countries to have paid back the debts they incurred in the 1980s seven times over. Parliament’s resolution also states quite clearly that the HIPC Initiative, which has been described by Mr Potočnik as the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever undertaken, is only a small step, and is of course by no means enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to know what the Council Presidency’s specific goals in this field are, both working alone and in cooperation with other international partners, as on the basis of your comments my impression is that the driving force on this issue will be the Council, not the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, it is one of the many means at our disposal for aiding development and goes hand in hand with preferential loans, free funds and the system of generalised preferences we are implementing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this reduction in the debt is not an end in itself but a means, we must, I think, have the decency to bear in mind that it is a means made available through the efforts of our countries’ taxpayers and that it must therefore, of course, be made conditional upon the achievement of results. Our partners, and principally our African partners in NEPAD, have also understood perfectly well that they themselves have to make efforts, particularly in terms of good governance and respect for our common values, to put their countries on the road to development. Where this matter is concerned, let us therefore have the honesty to recognise that the best pupils must be rewarded.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is agreed that reducing the debt is an operation in itself, consideration must also be given to the subsequent debt, since no country will, of course, be able to continue its development without getting into debt. We therefore need to have a forward-looking vision and not just appease our consciences by saying: the debt is reduced or cancelled; now let them get on with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As various speakers have said, though, one should not generalise. Some countries are governed well, and others badly, and we cannot promise all of them that we will write off their debts and solve their problems overnight. In practical terms, for example, it is unacceptable that Zimbabwe should be treated in the same way as Uganda. Every aspect, every country has to be considered on what is politically speaking the best solution, and debt cancellation is one of the ways of contributing to the country’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution is extremely vague. What, for example, are the practical implications for the European budget? I believe that only the European Investment Bank grants loans, and the European budget stands surety for those loans. What will happen if we cancel those loans? How much will this cost? Perhaps the Commission could elaborate on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have all understood the urgency and the exceptional nature of the situation confronted by a number of countries, particularly those affected by the natural disaster. Where Iraq is concerned, I do not believe that anyone doubts the necessity of helping with the reconstruction of that country. That being said, there does arise the issue of what is to be done for all the other developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all – and I rather concur with what the Commissioner said – we cannot be content to proceed in the same way where everyone is concerned. Developing countries are not all alike. There are very different situations. I therefore believe that we must concentrate firstly, and crucially, upon the poorest and least advanced countries and ask what we can do specifically for them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, we can relieve, or indeed cancel, their debts. I believe that this is an initiative that must be supported and promoted. Within which frameworks are we to act? There is the debate to be conducted within the framework of the forthcoming European Councils; I mentioned in particular the April European Council which is to concentrate upon analysing and, if need be, revising the European Union’s undertakings when it comes to achieving the Millennium Objectives. There is the European Union’s support for the initiatives taken within the G8, particularly those of the G8 Presidency at the forthcoming summit in the United Kingdom. Europe must therefore promote this idea of debt relief or, indeed, cancellation. It cannot, however, do so indiscriminately as, by proceeding in that way, its action would lose credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, cancelling or relieving the debt only makes sense if the rich countries increase their development aid. The European Union has entered into undertakings in this regard, and they should be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, the debt – large though it may be – must be placed within a broader political framework for development cooperation. There is no point in cancelling the debt if, at the same time, our borders are closed to certain imports from developing countries. There is no point in cancelling the debt if we then subsidise certain products in our own countries and thereby hinder the development of these same products in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I believe that cancellation is an important factor, though not the only one, in a development strategy, or genuine development partnership, which the European Union must buckle down to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of important and useful suggestions and comments were made today. I should like to respond as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it should urgently be emphasised that poverty is not just a question of debt relief. The real issue is appropriate levels of development financing. Second, it is important to distinguish between different countries, in particular between the least developed countries and other developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the <span class="italic">per capita</span> figures on debt relief were not presented to you with the aim of cutting back on aid, but rather the opposite: to use this criteria in order to alleviate the debt burden for those countries that really need it most.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the UN and the Commission will coordinate their efforts with other international organisations on the HIPC and other initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, a new World Bank-IMF sustainability framework recognises the inadequacy of existing debt relief efforts. The new framework will: first, set indicative debt burden thresholds that are country-specific; second, take account of external shocks; third, ensure greater transparency and dialogue in assessing that sustainability. That is what the new sustainability framework is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, relief for Iraq should not be at the expense of the poorest countries, and a debt moratorium for countries hit by the tsunami would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will closely follow the issue of the external debt of developing countries, in particular the least-developed ones. There also remains much to do as regards considering debt relief for the countries of Southeast Asia hit by the earthquake and tsunami. The Commission will maintain a continuous dialogue with the European Parliament in all the above fields of action.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that for some developing countries external indebtedness is a major obstacle to growth and development. Debt relief can indeed be a useful tool in that quest, but by no means can it offer a full response. Aid, socio-economic policies, trade policies, etc. that ensure the sustainability of these countries in the long run are crucial. That is what they would want and what they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
