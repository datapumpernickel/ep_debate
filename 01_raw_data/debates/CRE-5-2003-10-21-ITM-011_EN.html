<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">joint author of the oral question</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was, at first, only people in Germany who had to endure what was termed deposits on cans but ought, more accurately to be termed the enforced deposit. Now people throughout Europe are being sore tried by the amateurish approach adopted in Germany, and so the European People’s Party has supported the Liberal group’s request to have this oral question put on Parliament’s agenda. Commissioner Bolkestein was right to reveal on television that those of us who live in Germany are currently in a state of chaos as a result of the deposit imposed on cans.</p>
<p class="contents">Five different systems currently operate across Germany to administer this deposit, but they cover only some 10% of the overall German market. Alongside them there are the so-called individual systems, operating on a regional basis or limited to particular chains of supermarkets, but, as these do not constitute a self-sufficient whole, their effect is to wholly fragment the can deposit system. Such a result was only to be expected. I do not want to say anything about the discrimination against certain German firms within Germany, as that is not – unfortunately – a pan-European issue, but is for the Bundestag in Berlin to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say something about the discrimination that is going on in Europe. Article 28 obliges every Member State to guarantee free trade, and this article is being quite openly breached. The Commission has received masses of complaints, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, and, in particular, from those based in the Benelux countries, Italy, France and Austria. Quite apart from these complaints, there has also been a great deal of disruption in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that German consumers have lost some EUR 500 million through having had to pay a deposit somewhere or other, but not having had the opportunity to cash in their deposit tokens at the same place later on and thus get their deposit back. You – any consumer – can easily get practical experience of this. All you need to do is to buy a drink at a service station and then drive off. If you never go back to that service station, you will never be able to return the can or bottle that you bought there and will never get back the deposit that you paid on it. That is how, in only a few months, the consumer ends up with a loss of EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, the estimate loss in terms of jobs alone amounts to 10 000, all lost as a result of this incompetence. I might add that I have not invented these figures or been given them by some organisation or other; they come from the German Federal Ministry of the Economy, which is part of the same Federal Government that has to take responsibility for all these goings-on. It is reckoned that this nonsense will cost a further 15 000 jobs across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">All this leads us to welcome the Commission’s decision to commence, today, proceedings against the Federal Republic of Germany for infringement of the Treaties. It is evident, by the way, that the celebrated telephone conversations between Brussels and Berlin have been ineffective and that the Chancellor’s phone call to Mr Prodi has obviously availed him nothing. Perhaps that has something to do with our getting this oral question onto Parliament’s agenda for this evening, and this evening’s deliberations have perhaps accelerated the Commission’s thinking processes and steered them closer to Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposals. This is very much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to deny that I, myself, am fundamentally sceptical about the idea of a deposit on cans. If there is a political decision at national level to introduce a deposit on cans, then Europe will have to accept it, but the nation in question will have to get it right. There are examples of how to do it properly. There are can deposit systems in Scandinavia, but they are unitary systems with a standardised returns facility, and do not have a discriminatory effect.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it quite bluntly, the German federal government is faced with the choice of either introducing such a system taking the necessary actions by means of regulations or legislation in Germany, or of simply doing away with the deposit on cans. Such are the two alternatives before it. If it does not do so, it risks not only ending up before the European Court of Justice in infringement proceedings set in motion by the Commission, but also faces the risk that aggrieved parties in the persons of businesses, manufacturers and even consumers will act on the more recent case-law of the European Court of Justice and commence public liability proceedings against it before German courts, which could then petition the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, with the possibility of claims running into millions, if not billions, in compensation, for which sums the German Minister of Finance would be liable. That I would regard as a highly problematic situation, and so I can do no other that advise the German Federal Government to comply with the Commission’s instructions and either create a system compatible with the internal market or abolish the deposit on cans.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, I publicly urged the Commission, to help the German consumer, the manufacturers and the importers. I am glad that it has done so. This question is intended, above all, to support the Commission in its efforts at finally sorting out the chaos that this has brought to Germany. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of the above-mentioned issues. It has analysed the matter and I can inform Parliament, as Mr Lehne has already mentioned, that this morning the Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice to the German Government because the Commission considers that it has infringed Article 28 of the Treaty and Article 7 of Directive 94/62/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">May I stress that the Commission is not questioning the setting up of a deposit system as such, but rather the modalities under which this is occurring. The reasons for this are as follows: firstly, there are no nationwide return systems. At present the two systems deemed to be nationwide, Lekkerland-Tobaccoland and VFV, have a market share of no more than 12% of the beverages which are subject to the deposit. Furthermore, they mostly cover small kiosks and canteens with a sales area of less than 200 square metres. Under the relevant law, these smaller outlets have a legal obligation to take back empty bottles and cans of the 'same type, shape and size', but only of the same brands which they themselves sell.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the so-called individual solutions – <span class="italic">Insellösungen</span> in German – pose a continuous problem to intra-Community trade. They are a direct result of the relevant German law under which the obligation for bigger retailers to take back empty packaging applies only to packaging of the same type, shape and size as that which they sell. Today a number of individual solutions exist and they pose serious problems. This provision in German law induces major retail chains to force European producers to modify the packaging of their products and the European Court of Justice holds that, when EU producers are obliged to modify their packaging in order to market their products, that fact alone amounts to a barrier to intra-Community trade. Extra costs are incurred and the import of products becomes more burdensome.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the systems are not all fully interoperable. Indeed, on the one hand, for the growing number of individual solutions there is no legal obligation to take back packaging which belongs to any of the other collection systems, even if this differs only slightly from the one that they sell. Furthermore, as far as the interoperability between VFV and Lekkerland-Tobaccoland is concerned, it appears that a number of technical issues have not yet been settled. For example, it is still not clear how a financial clearing of the deposits between several systems will work.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, delisting persists and one-way products that are not an individual solution are not to be found on the shelves of certain stores. We have firm evidence that several major retail chains in Germany have delisted. Importers from other European countries are particularly affected by this, as they sell their drinks almost exclusively in one-way packaging for reasons mainly related to long-distance deliveries. Perhaps in the case of a number of existing individual solutions, some well-established importers do not necessarily suffer in their protected arrangements, but this does not compensate for the major losses incurred through the substantial decline in imports from other Member States as a result of this fragmentation of the German market for these products. Therefore the Commission has now decided to issue a letter of formal notice in which it raises these and some other questions and it has asked the German Government to reply to those questions and to provide a justification for the measures undertaken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, let me start by extending warm thanks to Commissioner Bolkestein for the fundamental criticism he has very expertly levelled with regard to the German system and for the way in which other Member States can also draw lessons from this when they do not think first before they act. I have the feeling that Mr Trittin, whom I saw briefly on television this evening, has not yet grasped this notion. He acts indiscriminately and does not think about what the implications for Europe could be. The Commissioner has given a clear analysis on this and I think we should all be pleased that a solution to the problem now seems to be in sight.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since April, we have asked questions about this issue. On 1 July, we asked questions on this matter during the debate on packaging waste and, Mr Bolkestein, Commissioner Wallström then answered on your behalf that an enquiry would be launched. The real question is this: why have we had to wait so long, from 1 July to 21 October, for formal infringement proceedings?</p>
<p class="contents">Industry is being seriously hampered by this German measure and is now asking how long it will take before the problem will be solved. Not only the German consumers suffer, all those foreign tourists who, via the German <span class="italic">Autobahnen</span>, spend their holidays somewhere in Germany or even further afield, also suffer under the system. A lot of money is simply left unclaimed. These consumers are also asking when this problem will now be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when I look at my region, the Brabant and Limburg region, I notice that particularly in areas where there is a lot of cross-border movement, even smaller businesses that supply soft drinks, water or beer, often in non-reusable packaging, have suffered a loss in turnover of more than 30 to 40%. The Commissioner claims that, strictly speaking, it is possible, even under current procedures, for these businesses to claim damages. This is all well and good, but these small businesses wonder how long they will survive when a large proportion of their market is being closed off. The Dutch market, the Austrians, the Belgians and the French rely on this German market to a large extent. If it remains closed for too long, then this is very bad and we may well make things difficult for ourselves. That is why I am urging the Commissioner to make every effort to speed things up, so that the system is actually withdrawn. Mr Trittin failed to indicate in so many words that that was his intention, but I would ask you to pull out all the stops. What is the timeframe we should be looking at? I should, in fact, also like to thank you for the efforts you have made. I have to say that the adequate response is very positive for the internal market in Europe. We are all in favour of this internal market, which is not only beneficial to the consumers, but where industry can, and should, gain a great deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, there is a confrontation between political parties and much of the blame for the fact that we are having this discussion tonight lies with these German politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, we must remember that, in 1991, the German Christian Democrat Government, when Klaus Töpfer was minister, introduced a regulation on packaged goods, which took shape in 1998 under the Environment Minister, Angela Merkel, of the CDU, and in 2001 an attempt to improve this regulation failed because the majority of the CDU in the Bundesrat blocked it, and it was therefore not possible to establish a suitable system for recovering packaging. In any event, I believe that the German Government has taken the bull by the horns and is trying to resolve a problem which today affects the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would like to ask the Commissioner is to what extent the Commission and the institutions of the European Union are failing to fulfil their duty when they do not propose or adopt Community legislation to prevent this accumulation of solid waste, which is currently making it very difficult to organise the work – in cities, for example – with enormous costs for local authorities in terms of providing these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you an anecdote, for example, about how on my island, which is a small island with 300 volcanoes, we began to use a volcano and it is almost full already and, in this way, before long we will not have volcanoes, but mounds of rubbish. I have the feeling, Mr President, that at the moment, and despite the fact that I think it is right for the Commission to try to harmonise measures, we must remember Articles 174 and 176 of the European Union Treaty – which are in place – which, on the one hand, empower the States to adopt measures to better protect the environment, but on the other, encourage the Community institutions to adopt general measures, so that a problem as serious as the one we have today with the accumulation of solid waste can be resolved in the only rational way, which is the Community way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commissioner to analyse the possibility of achieving Community legislation to harmonise the situation, and I believe that we must not restrict ourselves to using an internal political problem to cause difficulties for a European Union government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that this Liberal initiative, which, by the way, received unanimous support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has helped you to reach your decision. Given the timeframe, it looks like it was of some help. I would like to concur with Mr Medina Ortega that we are not, in principle, opposed to a deposit system. If we want a deposit system, it would perhaps be helpful within one internal market if we were to introduce a harmonised Community system, as a result of which all businesses and all consumers within one Europe would know where they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">We are against a restricting deposit system, and the voucher system in Germany does not belong in serious legislation but rather on a fairground, where it entitles you to a few rides on the merry-go-round, but not to do a few laps in Germany. As far as this is concerned, we are pleased with your announcement that you are going to intervene. What I would like to know is whether you could indicate whether it is possible to force, or at least implore, the German Government to suspend the current system with immediate effect? This should happen in any event until a European-wide system has been introduced, or at least a system that complies with the current framework, so that Article 28 would not be violated. This is my first request.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, can you confirm whether it is true – as Mr Lehne claimed – that businesses that have suffered enormous losses, but also perhaps consumers, could recoup the damage from the German Government, for example?</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that with this measure that you announced, German consumers will very soon again be able to choose freely between such European products as Badoit water, San Pellegrino or Bavaria beer. If this were possible, then I hope that after these ten months of being deprived of these enjoyable European products, the European market will once again be open and that it can help complete the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our experience in Germany shows that this system has demonstrated its ecological steering function, in that fewer cans are spoiling the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">So, when you say on the one hand, that you are not against cans, I agree with you, but I cannot quite understand why, on the other hand, you apply double standards. I am no more satisfied than you are with these individual solutions; we would all have preferred a standardised system. You will be aware, though, that it is not policymakers who bear responsibility in this instance; massive pressure was exerted by industry, especially by traders.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we see individual solutions in Spain and Portugal too. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, why you allow individual solutions in two Member States but not in another. When you tell us how you are not opposed to deposits on cans, and how the environmental action programme has shown you to be a firm advocate of reusability, I really do ask myself why we in the European Union do not do what has just been referred to, and introduce harmonisation, thereby making a statement about our desire to improve the environment and also to increase the reuse of packaging, firstly, because it really does play an ecological role, and, secondly, because reusability – as we know – makes jobs safer.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, for the sake of preventing waste, do we not go ahead and make reusable packaging mandatory throughout the European Union? That would make your arguments consistent with each other. If we do not, then many will get the impression that we really are applying double standards, with individual solutions being permitted in some Member States but not in Germany. That is something on which I would like an answer from you. You must not, of course, give the impression that what the current state of affairs is primarily about is mounting a campaign against Germany’s environmental policy decisions; on the contrary, the Commission, too, must demonstrate that it wants environmental integration. If you, Commissioner, are a supporter of the internal market, then it is your duty as much as anyone else’s to have an integrated approach to environmental policy. Avoiding the piling-up of rubbish means backing reusability, for that is what we have decided in the environmental action programme and on many occasions in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also all support the waste hierarchy where it is best to prevent, it is next best to re-use and recycle, and after that comes energy recovery. For recycling, we welcome public education schemes and voluntary schemes. We have no problem with the German Government if it goes down these roads, or indeed down the Scandinavian nationwide road. However, it has chosen to go down an imposed route without consideration for customers or indeed for other EU countries. It is not just a German domestic problem: it is an Austrian problem, a Belgian, Dutch, French, Luxembourgish, Italian, Swedish and British problem. All these countries have been affected by this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Markets and jobs have been lost and consumers are the losers, whether as a result of the import blockade or the inability to recover their deposits. There is virtually no gain for the environment in this scheme. Non-compliance with internal market directives threatens the economic success of the European Union and I very much support Mr Bolkenstein's action and hope that this leads swiftly to German compliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by congratulating the German Government on its ambitions. It is of the utmost importance for there to be governments that are progressive in the environmental field and that are not frightened to take controversial measures. Everyone can level well-founded criticism at the German deposit system. I share this criticism and I will return to this in more detail in a moment. However, before I do this, I should like to emphasise how important it is to take courageous decisions, political decisions, with which consumers can clearly identify.</p>
<p class="contents">For months, we have been droning on about the Packaging Directive, about whether the objective should be 55% or 60% and whether the system should be introduced in 2008 or 2007. It is therefore refreshing if a government has the nerve to be a trendsetter and stick its neck out. Of course, one or two things are up for criticism, and there is room for improvement in terms of the way in which it has been introduced, but I would also like to point out that those who have submitted this question are now shedding crocodile tears.</p>
<p class="contents">During the review of the Packaging Directive, amendments were tabled to solve the internal market problems. In these, it was proposed only to permit deposit systems if the environment were to gain from this in a demonstrable manner. In other words, a good environmental reason had to be given for infringements of the internal market. This amendment did not make it because the Liberals and the Group of the European People’s Party voted against it.</p>
<p class="contents">The German deposit system – as most Germans agree – is not an attractive solution. It is very annoying to have to return your tins to the place where you bought them. There is less unanimity when we consider the impact on employment and the market. The German system leads to a clear shift from tin cans to other packaging, which, in turn, is not fair on the industries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this would still be justifiable if an environmental goal were to be served by it, but this is not the case. The loss of employment outside of Germany is now forming a disproportionate burden on a large number of sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proven to be a flexible and understanding partner, but patience can, and does, wear thin in the end. It is now time for action in Berlin and, consequently, also for the Commission. This happened this morning, for which I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a political solution, however. The Court caused a great deal of commotion with the Packaging Directive by excluding waste incineration from recovery. The German deposit system can also result in a legal conflict, which is always undesirable politically speaking. This would be difficult to explain to consumers lugging their tin cans or to workers losing their jobs. To solve political failure, the Commission, Parliament and the Council must come up with a solution of their own that is structural. I am urging the Commission to take the initiative in its own hands and provide clear legislation. Only then can we ensure that infringements of the law can be acted upon immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems with the German deposit system do not stand in isolation. We have had major problems in the past. Deposit money was often used as a disguised form of protectionism in favour of the country’s own products, for which there is no excuse whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to ask you a few more questions. What are the options, in your mind, to eliminate these problems once and for all? Is the Commission prepared to cooperate to amend the Packaging Directive via a fast-track procedure, so that these problems can be resolved? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The environmental burden of re-usable plastic bottles is two to three times lower, and so, environmentally speaking, a deposit system is a good way of reducing litter. At the moment, deposits are payable on disposable cans throughout Sweden, the whole of Denmark and all of Germany. The Commission, the Liberals and also the Christian Democrats are not averse to the principle of deposit systems. This is an improvement. Unfortunately, Mr Lehne stands outside of this consensus. The deposit system also exists in parts, and I repeat in parts, of Spain and Portugal. The Commission is not summoning Spain and Portugal before a European court. In the Netherlands too, you cannot take all returnable bottles to all supermarkets. The Commission has been put under pressure by campaigns from businesses and from elements in this House. This shows once again that the Commission sets greater store by the internal market than by the environment. In ten states and in some fifteen large cities in the United States too, ‘island’ solutions have been provided in the form of local and regional deposit systems. The fact that Germany happens to have an unsuccessful system, under which you cannot return your tin cans to any shop, has to do with the boycott campaigns by large sections of industry, which are opposed to the deposit system principle. Irony has it that historically, they all have their origins in an act dating back to 1991 that was submitted by a Christian Democrat Environment Minister, Klaus Töpfer, which the present Minister, Mr Trittin, a Green, is now simply implementing. Germany will eventually make it easier to get the deposit money refunded in different places. This deposit system will then become very common. The Commission should, in fact, propose the introduction of deposit systems throughout Europe. We should let children and junkies earn a few euros on the back of the idleness of parents and their fellow citizens. This is preferable to the situation in the Netherlands, where EUR 80 million is being squandered on a pointless advertising campaign entitled ‘Nederland schoon’ – Keep The Netherlands Clean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked me why it took so long to start an infringement procedure against Germany. The answer is that the Commission wanted to give the German Government every opportunity to explain its actions and to redress the situation. There has been a lot of correspondence back and forth and Minister Tritin has visited Brussels. This has been done in order to give the German Government the opportunity to change this unsatisfactory situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten further asked how long it will take to solve the problem. This depends on the German Government. At this moment the Commission can do no more than it has already done.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Medina Ortega asked why there should not be a European solution. In my view, the subsidiarity principle provides that, in this case, since it is not really a cross-border situation, it is up to Member States to take the requisite action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Manders asked whether it would be possible for the German Government to suspend the present rules. That is precisely what the Commission has asked the German Government to do. Until now, the German Government has not wanted to do so and that is why the Commission has now decided to start infringement proceedings. Furthermore, Mr Manders asked whether it would be possible for companies to sue the German Government to get compensation for the losses they have had. That depends on the law of the Member States concerned – in this case German law. It is not the duty of this Commissioner to make a pronouncement on German law and therefore we must wait to see what will happen with the companies that have suffered losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Breyer asked why I attacked the individual solutions<span class="italic"> </span>the <span class="italic">Insellösungen</span>. These have lead to a break-up of the German market, and that is obviously contrary to the spirit of the internal market. She also mentioned Spain and Portugal in this connection. We have not had complaints about Spain and Portugal; in the case of Germany we had 50 complaints from 10 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Corbey said that the Commission should see to it that the German legislation is transparent. The result of the Commission's infringement proceedings should indeed be that German legislation becomes clearer. At the moment, the legislation, and in particular the way it is implemented, is anything but clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mrs Corbey wanted a definitive solution to this problem. Once again, as I said earlier, that depends on the reactions of the German Government. The Commission would like nothing more than to see a final solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
