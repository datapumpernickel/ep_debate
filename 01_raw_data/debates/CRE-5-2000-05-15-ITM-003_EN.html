<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jeggle (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you had a wonderful weekend and that you were able to relax somewhere in Europe in our fantastically beautiful – and, above all, undamaged – agricultural landscape, which is responsibly and lovingly tended by our farmers. It is in this spirit of optimism that we can begin this debate on our report on the prices for agricultural products in 2000/2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, this report was always the subject of fierce debates on farm incomes. The decisions made under Agenda 2000 established many principles, not necessarily always for the best as far as agriculture is concerned. This Commission proposal, too, contains a series of points which will again lead to a reduction in farmers’ incomes. In my report I make my opposition to this absolutely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to further reduce the additional charges on the intervention prices for cereals in two stages and then to fix them. The Commission’s proposal to reduce the monthly increments would mean another substantial deterioration in farm incomes. In this context, we also reject the Commission’s plan to make the intervention criteria stricter. If the minimum moisture content threshold were lowered this would reduce the compass of the intervention safety net and increase the proportion of the cereal crop which is, in principle, excluded from intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point – and here, judging by recent press releases, the Council appears to be coming round to the Agriculture Committee’s point of view – relates to Mrs Schreyer’s proposal to cut the agriculture budget by EUR 300 million per year in favour of the EU's foreign policy, despite the fact that additional money has still not been made available to remedy the extensive forest damage. At this stage I should like to state clearly once again that however important the EU's commitment to the Balkans is, the agriculture budget does not constitute an inexhaustible supply of funds which we can use to finance all our other desirable policies. The agriculture budget is neither a self-service shop nor a high-yielding dairy cow. Mrs Schreyer says that, of course, the EUR 300 million will not come out of direct support, but that is irrelevant because in the second pillar of agricultural policy too – that is, promoting the development of rural areas and stewardship of the countryside – each and every euro is necessary and well-spent. Our farmers are already experiencing uncertainty of a kind which ought to make us stop and think.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural change is not, in itself, a bad thing; it is much more the consequence of a huge improvement in training and therefore in knowledge, skills and technology. But if an increasing number of farms are going out of business, farms which we have classified as viable from a political point of view, and if farmers are complaining about their workload, which is becoming unbearable, then something is wrong, and perhaps something is also wrong with our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our job to put in place tangible and enduringly reliable or – with your permission I will borrow a word from our definition of modern land management – sustainable framework conditions and not to turn the screws – including the tiny ones – even further. After all, we have already tightened the large ones as far as they will go.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term! We need a new vision for our farmers which is forward-looking and geared towards future needs.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I should like to ask the Commission whether, and to what extent, it is prepared to accept the amendments we adopted unanimously in committee. I am obviously asking because there is the possibility of referring this back to the committee if the Commission is not prepared to take on board points which are important to Parliament. I refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I recognise that the budget year begins on 1 July and that a referral back to the committee might mean that the Council would not be able to decide in time, which would again be disadvantageous for agriculture. That is what I want to prevent at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the European agricultural landscape. I should like to finish with the sentence: ‘Food and drink hold body and soul together’. Let us not forget this, even in our political considerations and decisions!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing more, nothing less. This is an achievement in itself in certain sectors of agriculture. In various European countries, large groups of farmers are in dire straits. At present, there is a great deal of suffering in silence.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, it would seem that the agricultural budget was born under a lucky star. The euro-dollar rate impacts favourably on the budget, although certain figures are a cause of concern. There is nothing to say, however, that things will remain the same forever. Despite this, the Commission has made various proposals to benefit from the agricultural budget, if possible. Sometimes, these discussions focus on the sugar sector and other times they home in on other sectors of the agricultural budget. The Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that we must keep to what was agreed in the plenary a number of months ago, namely a situation in which the agricultural budget serves as a primary source of funding for external EU action should never arise. The budget will stick to this principle. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, according to the Committee on Budgets, the European Commission should come up with proposals to reform the sugar sector without delay. If we start to discuss the budget for 2001 in structural terms in September or October of this year, then it is essential to know what the Commission has in mind for the sugar sector. Am I not right in thinking that sugar fell outside the scope of the Berlin agreements? And in order to evaluate the 2001 budget effectively, we need to know this. I hope that Commissioner Fischler will be able to tell us this afternoon when he intends to produce reform proposals for sugar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that is not the case! In fact, we are discussing the proposals which the Commission has tabled following the Agenda 2000 reforms. May I, at this stage, specifically thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her work. Hitherto, people have regarded it as a routine annual exercise when we have had to debate prices for agricultural products. Year after year, blows were exchanged and, in that respect, I now welcome the fact that the fixed multiannual price proposals really can give farmers a rather more reliable framework in which to plan their production. However, I should like to warn you that, with this system, the annual review by the Council, the Commission and Parliament might not perhaps receive the attention which it deserves. The market situation, the outlook in the individual sectors and the trends in farm incomes as well as employment should continue to be examined by the European institutions on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals on setting institutional prices and monthly increments cover the products already mentioned. Most prices were fixed under Agenda 2000, but the Commission is proposing to cut the monthly increments for cereals by 7.5%. I should like to fully support the rapporteur’s stance in this regard. In our group’s view, the reduction in the monthly increments for cereals cannot be supported, not least because the Commission’s proposal undermines the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000. We should not continue to exert pointless pressure on farmers' incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to a topical issue, Commissioner Fischler, which is of interest to me. During the last plenary part-session, we once again discussed with Mrs Schreyer whether this EUR 300 million for reconstruction aid in Kosovo for 2001/2002 really could be taken out of the agriculture budget. I am familiar with the argument that we would save this amount because of the exchange rate mechanism. This was also reiterated when we were discussing the organisation of the market in sugar. But have I deduced correctly from the press that, at the beginning of last week, the Council in any case rejected this Commission proposal? I interpreted the press report as meaning that it did not support this, and I would be grateful to have the answer from your point of view, otherwise we will provoke a discussion here and debate the reality afterwards. Personally, I was extremely pleased at least by this admission from the Council at this stage.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And as Agenda 2000 adopted and extended this approach, the establishment of agricultural prices is henceforth multiannual. While, however, it must still be possible to make annual adjustments, they must nonetheless comply, for the most part, with the commitments made in Berlin covering this period.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me, together with my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to refuse to endorse the Commission’s proposal to reduce the monthly increments for cereals in two phases, by 7.5% each time. The same applies to moisture content in cereals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin agreement must continue to be our benchmark. This is the principled position that the European Union adopted in Seattle with regard to its trading partners and competitors within the World Trade Organisation. Logically, then, it should also set the standard in our debates on internal CAP matters. In particular, the European Union must fulfil its commitments in order to enable European farmers to have a clear idea of the policy as it affects them, in order to be able to manage their farms as wisely as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it imperative to lift the veil from this notion of making the agricultural sector pay for Kosovo. In this connection, then, I would urge the Commission to provide us very quickly with its proposed reform of the COM in sugar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is purely accidental. I will therefore not repeat what I said in the first two minutes. All these points which I mentioned are also backed by the Liberal Group. I would like to add a few more points, however. </p>
<p class="contents">We are living in an era in which the agricultural budget is extremely tight. The slightest movement in the dollar and euro rates would get us into great difficulty. This being the case, the Commission will have to make a choice as to what to do with the money that is available. Potentially, however, there is another very large gap. Over the past few years, we have been faced with outbreaks of epidemics of infectious animal diseases. We had the BSE crisis in Europe and several European countries suffered from swine fever outbreaks. These combined outbreaks have cost the European budget billions. It has so far been possible to finance them from categories other than the agricultural budget. </p>
<p class="contents">It was agreed in Berlin that this can no longer be the case. If I am not mistaken, the agricultural budget only comprises one item of approximately EUR 100 million for the control of animal diseases. This is peanuts compared to what was needed in the past to control outbreaks of infectious diseases. This is why the Liberal Group is expressly asking the Commission to produce proposals as soon as possible for coping with any disasters. One of the options is possibly to set up an insurance system throughout Europe, which would also promote fair competition. In anticipation of the budgetary discussions in September, we would like the Commission to provide us with the necessary data so that we can take this into consideration in the discussions of the budgets for the year 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context the report rightly points out that the Commission ought to submit a general document on this to Parliament, in the form of a concrete plan, before further austerity proposals can be accepted. Without a doubt, the issue of funding the whole reform package plays a decisive role.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not find satisfactory in this process, however, is the fact that we always speak first of reducing expenditure and revenue while at the same time transferring ever more tasks to the Commission, which, of course, does not reduce costs either. Up until 2006 the Commission should work on the basis of the realistic targets set and should deduce its financial needs from them. As a result of Agenda 2000, European farmers had to accept a EUR 5 billion reduction in their income. This meant that the agriculture budget was fixed at EUR 50.5 billion and it should stay as such.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve its objectives, the Commission should, in my view, be invited to present a report showing how costs have changed in the agricultural sector. Today, more deals are concluded in a second than used to be in an entire day and change is the only constant. Agricultural prices change particularly quickly. In the EU in 1999, the prices of crop products fell by 4% and livestock products by 6%. As a result of excessive over-production, pig prices fell by 9%. All the important agricultural products such as milk, beef, cereals and pork are suffering from increased turbulence on the world’s foreign exchanges, reducing farmers’ incomes still further. That is why we are still far from answering the question of how European Union farmers should make a living in the future. In the saturated marketplace, only products produced economically can be sold. The price reductions will destroy farmers’ livelihoods in Europe and thus temporarily ease the pressure on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this structural change the agricultural holdings which have been able to survive will further increase their output and wield even greater power on the world market. Another price war will lead to a new round of market redistribution. Further developments will show whether the reform of the EU’s agricultural policy by means of Agenda 2000 is capable of achieving its overall aims or not.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree fully with those who expressed their reservations today in relation to the Commission proposals on the cereals sector. I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">To farmers the price received in the marketplace should represent the real value of their professional endeavours, rather than what they often perceive as social support for the products of their labour. While not in any way wishing to detract from the overall success of CAP reform, as agreed in Agenda 2000, and acknowledging that without income support farmers would not survive, I must, at the same time, confess to some unease about a situation in which the produce of the land, as produced by our farmers, has to be sold at below production costs. This happens in many instances.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the support for agriculture – it is substantial and I acknowledge that because it represents almost 50% of the entire budget – must be seen also as a subsidy to consumers. With the availability of employment outside agriculture and the advances made by the EU and Member States in reducing unemployment, there is now a serious threat to the sustainability of Europe's traditional family farm. In recent weeks we have heard much talk about a review of the agricultural budget which was agreed in Berlin only a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I get the feeling that those concerned only with book-keeping have absolutely no understanding of what is happening out there in the real world. I warn that unless we become more vigilant and show a greater understanding of the unique and irreplaceable role of farmers in society, future generations and parliamentarians will be forced to react to save agriculture. That is what we are now doing in our attempt to rectify the rural-urban imbalance which we have allowed to develop over a period of years. Remember: that it was not the people who created this major problem for society; it was a lack of vision on the part of politicians and planners.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a fresh look at how better we can plan the long-term survival of agriculture as the profession responsible for food security and safety, taking account of the unique role of farmers as managers of the environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate the Commission on having included a multiannual element in the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, although this is a little repetitive, I would like you to bear in mind and reconsider, with regard to cereals, both moisture content and the monthly price reviews, since they are issues which could cause us considerable harm. There is also another question, and I feel that harsh words are required: every time a problem arises in this European Union or in its political positions – positions which I do not question – we consider taking funds away from the agricultural budget. This issue is of serious concern to us, since the Commissioner for Budgets has repeated that she intends to take EUR 300 million away from sugar to send to Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other matters which I would like to stress, which do not appear in the proposal on prices, such as my concern for the nut sector, hazelnuts and almonds, which is facing such great problems at the moment, since, in some cases, the improvement plans implemented by the Commission are coming to an end. Since its review is not finished, and until the problem of the nut industry is resolved, an extension of these improvement plans should be reconsidered, until its correct place is found, which should be the COM in fruits, where it will be treated in a genuinely differentiated fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">Other issues of concern to me do not appear, such as the case of asparagus intended for processing. Article 10(3) of the Regulation on processed fruits and vegetables provides for lump sum aid. This aid is going to stop very soon; it comes to an end during this season. How does the Commission intend to ensure that, in Europe, this aid is used to promote competitiveness and continues to be given to asparagus producers?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to table grapes, on 31 July aid expires for the production of juice, which is included in the COM in wine. In my opinion, it should be included in the next amendment of the COM in fruits. Once it has expired however, that is, from 31 July, what are we going to do, until the new reforms are approved, about the aid for table grape processing? Will it be extended? What is the intention here?</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation No 2275 also provides for aid for promotion in the flower and plant sector, and this aid is also coming to an end. How can this happen, given that the Council has asked the Commission to carry out a study on the evolution of the aid, in order to justify whether or not it should continue? I believe that, while waiting for this study to be presented – and we still know nothing about it – and then for a reform to be proposed, Regulation No 2275 should perhaps be extended. Does this fit in with the Commission’s plans? They are important sectors because they affect very specific areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider it a matter of great importance that we can have a clear and firm view of the future, at least until 2006. The departure from the Berlin Agreement – these sums are significant to agriculture, but extremely small on the level of the Community as a whole – the question in principle of departing from what has been agreed, is a very serious matter. It is necessary for this Parliament to make decisions on a new and ongoing agricultural policy after 2006. This kind of policy, which departs from what has been agreed upon, is not likely to create the stability and spirit that would enable us to share a common view of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing of which we seem oblivious, is the present everyday reality of agriculture. There has been a considerable rise in agricultural costs; fuel prices have gone up, and the level of costs in general is showing a constant upward trend. In addition to this, farmers as well as the food industry have invested a great deal in quality, in order to rid us of the scandals which have marred the European agricultural model. It is the farmers themselves who will ultimately have to pay these costs. The farmers for their part have carried out all their duties and obligations. We may only hope that the other party will also hold to those mutual agreements that have been made.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should like to take this opportunity, however, to note that first: producer prices and subsidies have been frozen for numerous agricultural products for twelve consecutive years, as is the case with sheepmeat and goatmeat, whereas for other products they have been falling due to the constant increase in production costs, thereby reducing net agricultural incomes, as the Eurostat figures also show. The question therefore is: what are the farmers doing about this? </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, eroding or even abolishing the intervention system will leave farmers at the mercy of traders, who buy from producers at derisory prices and then often resell at substantially higher prices. As a result, while nominal producer prices have fallen, often quite sharply, consumer prices have risen. In other words, both producers and consumers are being bled dry in the name of protection, which is what the European Union claims it is doing. The question is what will farmers and consumers do about this? Will they step up their fight? </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, low quotas and the resultant extortionate fines are eating up the subsidies for the 1999 harvest. Thus the subsidies end up becoming a white elephant. A blatant example is that of oil, which also concerns my country, and in particular my native island of Lesbos. Despite declarations that the 1998-1999 subsidy would be GRD 460, producers were only paid GRD 330, one year later. The same applies to cotton where, although the minimum price is EUR 101 per 100 kilos, Greek producers will be paid less than EUR 65 because of the co-responsibility levy. </p>
<p class="contents">We have the following comments to make on the issues addressed in the report: as regards cereals, we disagree with the reduction in the monthly increments of the intervention price, which should have been increased. Also, it must be said that this approach is further eroding the intervention system and, as with other products, it will apparently be abolished altogether for cereals. We also disagree with the monthly increment being paid in November, since harvest time in Greece is in June. And similarly with rice, we recommend that intervention commence on 1 October or November and not on 1 April because otherwise, our producers are at the mercy of greedy profiteering traders for six months….</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I think it is in your interest to use the support offered by the Members of the European Parliament in order to attempt to safeguard your budget for agriculture. When we see the way in which money is being used and diverted to finance other measures, we have good cause to wonder if we shall still have the resources to implement a European agricultural policy after enlargement, and moreover to ensure rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">When you achieve savings on cereals through moisture rates, how many millions does that amount to throughout Europe? And how are these millions going to be used? Do not forget that it is the intermediate regions that will be the first to suffer the effects, not the good cereal-growing areas, the main cereal-growing areas, but rather the regions where there are average production levels, where many farmers are currently experiencing problems. Looking across the board at agricultural regions, I am forced to note that it is these small- and medium-sized farms whose continuity is not assured, where the farmers’ children are looking for careers outside agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that this policy calls for caution, Commissioner. And you have our support. The agricultural budget must be used to promote rural development and to step up support to the family-type farms that exist at grass-roots level, rather than containing only budget measures whose sole purpose is to make savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are counting on you a great deal. We are speaking from the bottom of our hearts. Within Parliament we are aiming to defend the family farm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot stress this point enough: in our opinion, farming behaves like an economic system and, at present, the European Union’s focus is shifting towards mere public funding without defining guidelines and foundations which allow farmers to see what their future will be. Farmers are not having an easy time at the moment. The impression they get is that we intend to make the farming sector increasingly less productive in economic terms. Proof of this is provided by the recent events –– incidents which have occurred during the last few months linked to WTO negotiations – from the Kosovo intervention financing aid in this region – an irreprehensible priority, but implemented with debatable timeframes and procedures – to the cases which have already been mentioned by my fellow Members of cuts in the cereals sector or the delay in deciding upon the proposal for the sugar sector. If we want to protect the European agricultural model, which is synonymous with agribusiness, we must also make sure that this activity is not eliminated, and this may well result in an increase in employment levels as well. </p>

This is why, only recently, we carried out a reform of Agenda 2000: these price packages tend merely to make annual adjustments in response to one-off situations. The current price package comes at a time when the Commission has promised to present proposals for reform in various sectors over the current year, specifically the rice, sugar, fruit, vegetable and oil sectors. I hope that these reforms do take place. There is one particular situation that I would like to highlight, which concerns the issue of fruit and vegetables and which is of particular importance to my country.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the iniquity of the present regulations of the policy on processed tomatoes. Changes to quotas are made between Member States, and this happens every year within a framework which does not take account of unforeseen changes in the climate or the market, and this creates a permanent state of instability in the sector. A short while ago, therefore, following Mrs González’ report, the European Parliament approved the urgent establishment of guarantee thresholds at Member State level and the Commission was asked to present these proposals as a matter of urgency. </p>
<p class="contents">However, in the price package, the Commission has not presented anything in this regard to remedy the situation, and the Commission does not appear to be in any hurry to put forward a proposal either. My country is likely to lose 10% of its quota if the COM proposal is not adopted quickly, and this, quite frankly, is unacceptable. So the question is, why has the Portuguese Presidency not adopted initiatives to ensure that a proposal would be put forward with due haste? And why do they use the argument that “the tomato industry cannot be reformed because there is no money” when we spend the money we have on things other than agriculture, such as the financing provided for Kosovo? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you, Mrs Jeggle, very much for your report. After all, it is the first which you have tabled in the House. I should also like very much to thank the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the other committees, which have actively participated in the consultations, for their constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament agrees with the main thrust of the Commission's proposals, namely that we need more continuity and that prices therefore need to be fixed on a multiannual basis. With your permission, I will first comment on the background to, and the content of, the proposals which we have made. It is absolutely right – as has been stated here – that the price package is no longer as significant as it was in the past. As a logical consequence of the multiannual approach which we chose for Agenda 2000, the Commission has now also proposed to set the institutional prices and amounts for those sectors for which this is actually still necessary for an unlimited period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">This offers our farmers a considerably more stable framework for their longer-term planning, although we do not, in principle, rule out making any changes which may later prove to be necessary. The only exception to this multiannual approach in our proposals concerns the sugar sector, where the production quota regime currently in force – as most of you here probably know – will expire in the 2000/2001 financial year. That is why it would not have been appropriate – given that this final year has to be fixed now first – to introduce a change here. That is why we are also proposing that the current prices for sugar be kept for this final year of the production quota regime now in force.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the individual amendments put forward. Amendment No 4 seeks to leave the monthly increments unchanged. I cannot, to be quite frank, agree to this proposal, because you are wrong to claim that the reduction which we have proposed contravenes the decisions made in Berlin. On the contrary, this is the logical consequence of the decisions made in Berlin! You see, in Berlin it was decided to maintain the system of monthly increments. But that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts. In the past, too, we made adjustments– more or less – every year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I should also like, as it were, to warn you against believing that it would not be sensible to make this adjustment, because you have to bear one thing in mind: if the amounts are not adjusted and this leads to market supply being disrupted and to cereals being held back in the hope of higher carryovers, then farmers will lose more in the spring when they market their products than they would gain through these higher monthly increments. That is why I cannot accept this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue, which involves updating and tightening up the quality criteria, has, of course, been under discussion for months now. In the meantime, since we are, after all, dealing here with an area where the Commission has exclusive competence – I should also like to emphasise this – a vote has been held in the relevant Management Committee. That actually puts an end to the debate because, as of 19 April, Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 was enacted. I do not think that we should reopen this debate now. That is why I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 2 or 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the issue of moisture content has been raised here today, I should like to point out that the price of cereals might have been fixed in Berlin, but not the price of water! 14.5% is the maximum moisture content which traders customarily accept nowadays. It does not present a particular problem to farmers. After all, if a farmer does have bad luck and has rather higher moisture levels in his cereal crop, then all he needs to do is to pay the drying costs and the problem is solved! But we can no longer accept the idea of having grain in intervention storage which does not comply with usual international trade practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I also have a problem with including mustard seed in the support system, as you propose in Amendments Nos 1 and 3, because that would be contrary to the Marrakech Agreement. It would run counter to the peace clause which states that no new products may be incorporated into the support system.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7. Some clarification is probably called for here. Firstly, the funding of foreign policy measures for the 2000/2001 financial year, which is what we are discussing here, is not in any way linked to the setting of sugar prices. Secondly, the proposed reduction in the ceiling under heading 1a for the year 2002 does not prejudice the measures in any particular production sector either.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mrs Jeggle also addressed the situation in 2003 and subsequent years. Here, the Commission has decided that appropriations are only to be withdrawn once the political situation in Serbia has changed dramatically. If this is the case, the Commission will decide when it reviews the financial perspective in 2002 – as it decided to do in Berlin – how to meet any possible needs.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, the Commission has specifically decided not to prejudice anything here either. In addition, the Commission has decided that, as a general rule, funds can only be taken from heading 1a if sufficient funds are not available from other sources, and at the moment it is far from certain that this will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jeggle, you proposed that we should at least utilise the appropriations in 1b – i.e. those for rural development – and you linked this to the disastrous storms in Badem-Württemberg in which many trees were uprooted by the strong winds. This is a much more complex problem because here the Commission had originally intended to make it possible precisely to transfer funds between the two sub-headings. However, this was rejected by Parliament. That is why a transfer of this kind is not possible on the basis of the Financial Regulation currently in force and the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the question which Mrs Keppelhoff asked concerning what ECOFIN actually did decide. Well, the proposals which Mrs Schreyer circulated to ECOFIN were rejected for the time being. At the moment, however, we are, of course, still in the discussion phase; the actual budget debate on the 2001 budget is yet to take place. The rejection does not primarily or exclusively concern this issue of the 300 million; the proposals as a whole were given a negative reception by ECOFIN. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 8, to which Mr Mulder, in particular, referred, concerns a study on alternative ways of covering financial losses arising in the event of outbreaks of animal diseases. The study which Mr Mulder mentioned was also intended to examine the possibility of introducing a compulsory insurance scheme. We will commission a study of this kind. However, I have to tell you that the results will not be available until the end of the year. We will not obtain the results from those carrying out the study any earlier than that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the view expressed in the amendment that producers ought to take on more of the financial responsibility for eradicating animal diseases. However, in principle, it is the Member States who are responsible for this issue. That is why initially all we can do here is carry out an evaluation of the possible ways in which we at Community level might support the Member States in setting up schemes of this kind. In any case, this issue ought to be dealt with in the context of the review of veterinary legislation which is currently being carried out by the Directorate-General responsible for public and animal health.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Redondo asked a number of questions about the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, about nuts and about ornamental plants, and Mr Cunha asked about processed tomatoes. As planned, the Commission will submit a report on the functioning of the organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables before the end of this year. This report will not only cover fresh fruit and vegetables but also processed fruit and vegetables, and therefore processed tomatoes. We expect this report to be ready at the beginning of the second half of this year. As far as promoting ornamental plants is concerned – or to be more precise, Mrs Redondo, publicity for the ornamental plants sector – it is true that the Commission is carrying out a review here. In fact, we made this a requirement when the legal arrangements were introduced and, depending on the outcome of the assessment, we will table a proposal in sufficient time to ensure that there is no interruption in the publicity campaign. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
