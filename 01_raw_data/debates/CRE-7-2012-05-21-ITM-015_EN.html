<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, the issue of visa non-reciprocity continues to be a significant irritant in EU-Canada relations. Canada continues, as you know, to maintain the visa requirement for the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, and also reintroduced it for Czech citizens over two years ago. This is an issue we have raised numerous times in the course of the contacts we have with Canada, on every relevant occasion and at all levels, in order to try to find a solution in partnership with the Member States affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is the number one source region for asylum applications in Canada. This is, of course, a serious concern, and we know it could have potential negative effects on the successful conclusion and ratification of several important agreements with Canada, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the Strategic Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Visa-free travel between the EU and Canada does not fall within the scope of the CETA negotiations, and CETA has not been directly used as a way of putting pressure on Canada. However, the EU negotiators have repeatedly, in the margins of the negotiations, made it clear to their Canadian counterparts that this issue is important for the EU, and decisive for the Member States concerned. It has been pointed out to the Canadian negotiators that such measures are in contradiction with the spirit of an agreement like the CETA, which tries to bring the EU and Canada more closely together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the draft asylum reform proposed in Canada. Once this is adopted and in force, it should act as a deterrent to unfounded applications and lead Canada to lift the visa requirement for Czech citizens. We are ready to explore with Canada, in close cooperation with the Member States concerned, possible additional measures to help reduce unfounded asylum applications, and we plan to set up a joint working group on this issue. In the case of Romania and Bulgaria, full accession to the Schengen area will be an important factor with regard to Canada’s position on visas. The Commission will shortly present its seventh visa reciprocity report. This will include the Canadian issue and will set out the future approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Our previous report, in 2010, concluded that the EU was ‘confronted with the limits’ of the existing reciprocity mechanism. In the ongoing negotiations on the amendment of Regulation No 539/2001, the Commission fully supports improvements to the reciprocity mechanism to ensure solidarity among the Member States, provided that these are legally and institutionally sound and do not conflict with the Commission’s right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">A better reciprocity mechanism should enable the EU to exert quicker and more sustained influence over relevant third countries. All existing countries would be re-examined by the Commission under this new, more efficient mechanism. The Commission hopes that the legislative negotiations on all aspects of the proposal will proceed quickly, allowing agreement to be reached in the course of the Danish Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, citizens of three Member States still require a visa to enter Canada. This situation undermines the common European visa policy, which is based on reciprocity and is intended to ensure equal treatment for all EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States participate on an equal footing in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada. This agreement is crucial to the future of EU-Canada economic relations and will set out the future legal framework for developing these relations. As part of this agreement, Canada treats all Member States equally. However, when it comes to granting entry visas into Canada or equal treatment on the subject of waiving visas, Canada is not as consistent in its actions. Double standards are being applied and criteria are being used which are not sufficiently clear and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The new legislation on the Canadian asylum system discourages asylum applications from EU countries. This is yet another argument confirming that maintaining the visa requirements for the three Member States is unjustified. The Commission will soon ask Parliament, during this year, to give its assent to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada. Failure to apply equal treatment to all EU citizens when it comes to visa-free travel to Canada raises clear reservations with regard to the vote, and it is not out of the question that it will end up in the undesirable situation of the European Parliament withholding its assent. I should remind you that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs recently voted in favour of an automatic procedure for applying the reciprocity clause to third countries which maintain visa requirements for EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is obliged to find a solution to the current situation where visas are imposed on Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens. I call on the Commission to support, as a priority, during the negotiations on the comprehensive economic agreement, the waiving of visas for all EU citizens. The Commission has a duty to ensure that all EU citizens enjoy equal treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it also symbolises a major paradox and serious contradiction on the part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement will allow goods and services produced in Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic to move freely in Canada, and yet the citizens of these states do not enjoy the same right. In other words, goods produced in Romania, Bulgaria or the Czech Republic are, unfortunately, more important than the actual citizens of these Member States. This is an anomaly and act of discrimination which cannot be accepted, also highlighting the European Commission’s inability to guarantee equal rights for EU citizens. The European Parliament must constantly remind the Commission and Council that any lack of solidarity between Member States means that the European Union cannot function under ideal conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we can also say that the spirit of good cooperation is lacking from Canada. While, in the case of the Czech Republic, the reason given has discriminatory tones against an ethnic group, when it comes to Romania, Canada is keeping the refusal rate artificially high to justify these citizens not being included in the visa waiver programme. This is affecting numerous Romanian citizens, and I would like to mention here just those who have agreed to have their names made public: Maria Dalcu, Cosmin Drăgoi or Nicolae Ion. They have submitted complaints to us about the unjustified way in which Canadian consulates have turned down their visa applications. There are far more cases than this, which makes me even question the good faith of the Canadian authorities involved.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also definitely positive messages coming from the Canadian authorities which I have had the opportunity to meet as part of several official delegations. During the most recent visit to Ottawa, early this month, we received assurances both from the Federal Minister for emigration and from members of the Federal Parliament that the visa issue would be resolved once the new immigration law is adopted in June. However, tangible progress is extremely slow. Even if the new law comes into force, it is not clear when and if visas will be waived for citizens from Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, as other conditions may be used to continue blocking visa-free entry to Canada for citizens from these three countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress once again that the visa issue must not be sidelined by either Canada or the European Commission, but needs to be a priority on the bilateral relations agenda. As I have already said, goods and services cannot be more important than actual citizens. As representatives of these European citizens, it is our role to ensure that their rights take precedence over any other economic considerations. This is why I wish to end by saying loud and clear that ratification of the CETA agreement may also depend on the progress made on lifting visa requirements for Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not only are we addressing an issue which is of key interest and which directly affects European citizens from Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic, but we are also touching on the values of our Union and the principles on which we would like the Commission to stand firm as part of its negotiating mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the Commission will continue negotiating a comprehensive economic and trade agreement with the Canadian authorities, taking due account of our international commitments when it comes to trade and economic exchanges, as well as our rules and priorities for our own single market and our consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, and representing the interests of the Union in this negotiation, has a duty to make sure our economic and market rules are respected and upheld in any international agreement that is concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us not forget that our Union is not only about trade and economic exchange or about the free movement of goods and capital. It is also and mainly about people – about the citizens of Europe – and I hope that the Commission will put the core principle of European citizenship on the same level as our economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget, either, the existing common EU visa policy. Together with MEPs from Romania and the Czech Republic, I have already sent a letter to Prime Minister Harper expressing our hope that by the date of completion of negotiations for either or both of the bilateral agreement and the comprehensive economic and trade agreement, scheduled for the first quarter of next year, the visa situation for Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens will be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the situation today, we still have reason to be concerned. As you know, any future EU-Canada economic and trade agreement will have to be approved by this House, and we have made clear to Prime Minister Harper that we are not ready to compromise on the principle of equal treatment for all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that other points in the negotiations might be problematic, notably with regard to trade, preferential markets or energy and the environment, for example. We are not denying, or forgetting about, these crucial issues but are simply asking for a fair and comprehensive negotiating strategy on the Commission’s part – one which takes into consideration the concerns and warnings voiced by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us be clear and consistent and let us not conclude an agreement which would imply different levels of rights for European citizens according to whether they come from France, the UK or Germany, or from Bulgaria, Romania or the Czech Republic, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">As an elected Member of the European Parliament who comes from Bulgaria, I do not ask for any exemption or special consideration. I am simply standing up for equal treatment for all European citizens, regardless of their Member State of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would be grateful if the Commission could clarify whether this principle will indeed become a ‘red line’ for the EU when it is concluding negotiations with the Canadian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you, Commissioner, also inform us about your cooperation with Commissioner De Gucht on this matter, as we believe it is crucial that both citizens’ rights and trade considerations should be pursued on the same path, towards, we hope, a successful outcome? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the rightful business of the Canadian Government – and not us – to decide who it lets into its country, and why.</p>
<p class="contents">Canada is not discriminating against us Europeans: it introduced similar restrictions for Mexicans, even though Mexico is in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada has successfully lifted the requirement for temporary visas where conditions are met. It has done so for Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be serious confusion in the Commission’s stance in two regards.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is confusion as to whether such visa matters belong in free trade agreements. They do not; just as ‘Mode 4’ worker access is not appropriate in the draft EU/India free trade agreement, so traveller visa matters do not belong in this Canadian free trade agreement. Border issues like this are a matter for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of confusion is about the European Union being a country. Yes, it aspires to be a country, but it is not one yet. So it is not the business of this place to force Canada to treat every EU nation equally, as if we were one country. That is a matter for individual nation states working through their own embassies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canadians have laid down fair and reasonable criteria, including low immigration violation rates, low asylum claims, high integrity of travel documents and good cooperation on removals. Those are reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="contents">If this principle is breached, however, every EU Member State can expect the EU to start dictating all its border matters, and many EU Member States may well dislike losing control of their own borders to EU diktats. France and Spain have suspended Schengen on occasion, as has Spain this month, and the Dutch have tried to block Bulgaria and Romania. So in conclusion, Mr President, this is a line in the sand; a legal and political border that the EU must not cross.</p>

The objection I have is to pretending that the EU is one country and saying that we are trying to force equality on Canada as if the EU were one country. By all means let the national embassies argue with the Canadian authorities and do it for themselves, but I do not think the EU should be acting this way, and certainly not within free trade agreements. I am on the Committee on International Trade, and too much leeway is being given to items which are not to do with trade and jobs. Europe desperately needs trade and jobs at this point.</p>

Canadians do not need visas to visit EU countries, whereas Canada has imposed visa restrictions on these three EU Member States. This is because of a previous influx of people from those countries who outstayed their welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Canada takes the quite reasonable view that not all EU countries are the same, and that some pose a particular risk when it comes to unwanted visitors and guests. The Canadians want to pick and choose who they admit and who they do not. However, this realistic view of the world falls foul of the EU ideological view that the EU is, in fact, one country, and to discriminate against one of its regions is not permissible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canadian Government already has a very generous system of allowing visa-free entry for 24 EU Member States, but perhaps it has looked at my constituency, London, and seen what a completely unrestricted open-door immigration policy actually delivers. They will not get the visitors and migrants they want – the decent, hard-working and law-abiding – they will also get the down-and-outs, the deadbeats and the criminals. In Marble Arch, the very centre of London, we now have migrants living on the street, with all the unpleasant social and sanitary consequences that involves, which I will leave to your imagination.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what indiscriminate, visa-free travel can deliver. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement put in jeopardy by Canada’s reluctance to open its doors to allcomers is reputedly worth a potential USD 12 billion per annum, and would boost two-way trade by 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the world need now? Does it desperately need increased trade? Does it desperately need increased economic activity, jobs and increased prosperity? I think we would all agree that it does. Does it desperately need even more uncontrolled and unlimited migration? Most rational people would think that it does not. Let the Canadians choose who they want to let into their country, and on what terms. Let Canada and Europe get on with increasing the trade between them that can help us all out of the dire economic situation that we find ourselves in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We demand that the Commission resolves this problem without delay and prior to concluding the agreement with Canada. Otherwise, the reciprocity mechanism must apply. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we have to take ourselves seriously, which leads me to ask whether the new visa regulation will at least strengthen the reciprocity mechanism? Is that the case? Can we in fact prevent such practices as have occurred in relation to Canada from occurring again in future? The only thing I can say to that is: by no means. What has emerged, however, is that visa policy continues to be used as a means of exerting pressure against migration.</p>
<p class="contents">As my third point, can we please talk for once about the population group that is often meant when we talk about the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. It is the Roma. Many Roma have gone to Canada, and the Czech Republic argues that Canada is itself to blame for this because Canada has for years created incentives for high levels of immigration through its generous and tolerant asylum policy. That is Canada’s argument, and they are doing nothing to counter this. On the contrary, they go so far as to support it by saying: well, how is it that EU citizens are even able to go to third countries and claim asylum? Indeed, why is that? It is because the Roma have miserable living conditions in the EU – a situation of which we have been aware for many years, in which they are so discriminated against and excluded that it is no wonder that people are going to countries such as Canada. To me, this issue is also a kind of <span class="italic">Lex Roma</span>; and to that extent, if we really want to do something about it, if we want to prevent emigration, then we have to improve conditions at home.

Even though, in Canada’s case, we can undoubtedly count on high standards of security, the visa scandals of the past years and the far too frequent confusion of visa freedom with freedom of establishment – as is clear from the 700% increase in Serbian asylum applications, for example – should serve as a warning.</p>
<p class="contents">While one side has even resolved to have its own visa warning files, the other – as we know – has announced cost-cutting measures. However, it is precisely in sensitive sovereign areas such as the issuance of visas that privatisation can open the door to manipulation. After all, in 2004, 2008 and 2010, there were innumerable cases of visa fraud as a result of local corruption. As far as I am concerned, the EU should exhibit particular sensitivity in these areas and pay heed to ensuring the highest possible level of security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Third country nationals, such as those hailing from Canada, can enter any European Union country without a visa, whilst a number of European Union citizens still require a visa in order to enter the very same countries. The issue here, therefore, is the lack of reciprocity between countries, and not whether the European Union is a single country, as some colleagues have reiterated.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s case concerns Canada and the citizens of the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. Yet we have already witnessed the same scene with regard to the United States, and a similar situation is taking place in countries such as Brazil, which is still dragging its feet on the issue of lifting the visa requirement for certain countries, amongst which are Malta, Lithuania and Latvia.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the European Union is currently negotiating an Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada. At the same time, Canada persists in acting in a discriminatory manner against the citizens of Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic. The Commission has to make it clear that this is unacceptable. In the event of third countries demonstrating a lack of goodwill, the European Union should be able to re-introduce the visa requirement obligation on the countries in question as a last resort. In fact, we have just taken a vote on the issue a few weeks ago within the LIBE Committee, where we adopted the concept of a suspension mechanism. Naturally, for their part, the Member States must show solidarity with the countries that are being discriminated against and lend their support to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I believe that if we, for one, are not capable of taking both our citizens and foreign policy seriously, then we cannot expect third countries to treat us like a united group. On the other hand, the more we put up a united front, the better the chance of convincing them to respect a level playing field on the visa issue. This is why the Commission should act without delay with regard to this case and all the other pending cases involving a lack of visa reciprocity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, the European Union and Canada must step up their cooperation on electronic communications and information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that, in the transport sector, the European Parliament has approved the conclusion of three agreements between the European Union and Canada: an air transport framework agreement, a civil aviation safety agreement and a Passenger Name Record agreement, with all these agreements being regarded as model agreements for each category individually.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements facilitate the task of creating a single market for air transport between the European Union and Canada where investment could flow freely and where European and Canadian airlines would be able to provide air services without any kind of restrictions, including in the domestic markets of both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The air transport framework agreement includes a gradual phasing in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far-reaching cooperation on a number of issues, including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, the environment, air traffic management, State aid and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">All these bilateral agreements and, in particular, a comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the European Union and Canada are based on a spirit of trust and cooperation between parties. However, the same spirit of trust and cooperation must also be evident when it comes to providing a regime allowing visa-free travel to Canada for all European Union citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens to enjoy the visa-free travel regime to Canada as of this year. We call for a comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the European Union and Canada to be signed only on the proviso that all European Union citizens, which also means Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens, will enjoy the visa-free travel regime to Canada without any discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, they declared joint action to strengthen ties between the European Union and Canada. Much has happened in the international arena since then. The treaty which forms the basis of the European Union has undergone two major transformations. During this time, the euro has become the common currency of many of Europe’s countries. There has also been the greatest enlargement of the European Union in its history.</p>
<p class="contents">The values shared by the citizens of the European Union and Canada have strengthened and fortified the foundations of mutual cooperation, and the scope of that cooperation has extended much further than was foreseen in the initial plan. Plans have emerged in the fields of property rights, competition law and government procurement. It has not been possible to regulate all the new areas in this time but, as can be seen, further work is under way in order to ensure full implementation of the agreements which do already exist. I think, therefore, that there is a need for a breath of fresh air and – as I see it – for essential steps to be taken to develop economic relations between the European Union and Canada in the 21st century. Therefore, I welcome the progress being made in ongoing work in this area – the area of visa-free travel on an equal basis for the citizens of all the European Union’s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, of course, remember that not all the Union’s citizens are being treated equally. The explanations being offered by the Canadians make it look as if they are just dragging their feet instead of making a definitive decision. We Poles are experiencing similar treatment in our contacts with Canada’s neighbour, the United States. Although we are treated at the American border as European Union citizens, we are unfortunately treated as second-class European Union citizens. I think the economic and trade agreement being negotiated between the EU and Canada must not just contain measures on economic matters, but must also include measures which regulate civil matters. If we allow citizens from different EU Member States to be treated unequally, we are admitting that the common foreign policy, which also covers visa matters, does not in fact exist, in which case we would do better to stop spending large sums of money on it. Furthermore, it should also be remembered that what we are asking for – the ability to enter Canada without a visa – will only give EU citizens the same rights as those held by Canadian citizens, because after all, Canadians already enjoy visa-free travel to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fear that this agreement will meet the same fate as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The least we can say is that these negotiations on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement lack transparency. These negotiations began in 2009 and we are in the 12th round of negotiations. However, we cannot say that we are very well informed about the content of these negotiations. The Commission’s own website is blocked at the ninth round. It includes no real information and the most relevant information we have comes from Canada. What is worse, Parliament’s point of view hardly seems to have been taken into account from one resolution to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is the most ambitious agreement ever negotiated with Canada, indeed with any other state in the world. It is based on a so-called negative list approach for the liberalisation of services. Yet most public services do not seem to have been excluded from the negotiations. What will happen to services for health, education, electricity, telecommunications, drinking water and even culture, if only the economic and trade approach prevails on either side of the Atlantic? Only the interests of large public companies which want to win new market shares at the expense of the general interest, of the public interest of our communities, seem to have been taken into account. This vision of the world has, however, already caused quite enough damage for us to stop this headlong flight. Yet nothing is being done. The points of view of the experts responsible for assessing the impact of these agreements seem to be diverse to say the least. Some talk of creating 80 000 jobs in Canada, while others talk about cutting 30 to 150 000 jobs. A study of this kind does not seem to have been published for the European Union, and that is certainly a shame. The impact of this agreement could also have serious consequences for the local authorities and their public procurement, which, basically, seem to have been pushed aside.</p>
<p class="contents">Could we have an accurate assessment of this agreement and equally accurate impact studies on its consequences? ACTA should serve as a lesson for us; it does not and I regret that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that he is no longer here in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of deepening European integration further, resulting in a more effective, strong common supranational foreign policy, foreign trade policy and security policy. Any country that does not want such integration is free and has a sovereign right to leave the European Union, but it is wrong to constantly reject the desire of the other countries wanting such integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the subject, Canada is an important ally and economic partner of ours. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement desired by both sides, which is currently under negotiation, is intended to provide an essential tool for facilitating trade between the partners in their mutual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the existing visa restrictions on citizens from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Romania when travelling to Canada must be dropped. During the negotiations, European institutions must make this task their priority, which will help genuinely facilitate and liberalise trade relations between the European Union and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the trade agreement is to liberalise the trade in services, mainly in the travel and transport sectors, with its text having to contain measures aimed at eliminating the barriers impeding access to this services market. The requirements to have a visa are precisely such a barrier.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, Commissioner, that there is a direct link between the trade agreement and visa regime, and these barriers need to be lifted. Thank you, Commissioner, for your position. I expect the Commission to continue to ask our Canadian partners this question in the remaining rounds of negotiations, particularly in light of the forthcoming changes to Canadian migration legislation, of guaranteeing the principle of reciprocity and, of course, of the trade agreement being debated.</p>
<p class="contents">Visa-free travel to Canada for all European Union citizens is a key condition, the fulfilment of which will also genuinely facilitate trade between the European Union and Canada. I also share the view of my colleagues who stated previously that there is a risk that this agreement will not be ratified in our Parliament unless these conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring visa-free travel and guaranteeing reciprocity for all European Union citizens must be a priority for European institutions in their relations, especially with our strategic partners such as the United States, Canada and Australia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the first time since the Lisbon Treaty allowed us to do so, we have concluded EU agreements on investment issues. It seems that the proposal will include provision for investor-State dispute settlement. This will mean that not only States but also individual investors can sue EU States over what they regard as obstacles to their investments. This might seriously reduce our powers here in this House, and also in the national parliaments, to regulate on environment-related, social and labour issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is proposed to maximise economic profit and benefits, but our own EU assessment – the economic, social and environmental assessment – says there is no solid evidence to suggest that investor-State dispute settlement will maximise economic benefit in CETA beyond simply serving as one form of enforcement mechanism, just as State-State settlement is also an enforcement mechanism. It goes on to say that a well-crafted State-State dispute settlement mechanism might be a more appropriate enforcement mechanism in CETA. So our own assessment says we should move in another direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of an investor-State settlement mechanism was introduced in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because Mexico’s courts were considered to be corrupt, but in the end the mechanism was used mainly against Canada. Twenty-eight cases have been taken against Canada under NAFTA, and out of them eight have been concluded officially. Four have been lost – 50% have been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention very briefly the case of Ethyl Corp versus Canada. Canada decided to ban, for health reasons, a gasoline additive, and the Ethyl company took Canada to the NAFTA tribunal. It made Canada pay CAD 16 million in compensation, apologise and withdraw the ban. I believe that this is not the kind of regulation we can accept in this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before this, during the last summit between the European Union and Canada, a commitment was made to remove the remaining barriers preventing a visa-free travel regime from being achieved for all European Union citizens. Almost two years have passed since then, but the visa regime is still in place, restricting the free movement of citizens from these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the European Parliament, there is only one category of citizens within the European Union, and there is definitely no ‘second-class’ category.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s negotiations with Canada on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement will define the future legal framework for economic relations between the European Union and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">A key aspect of economic and trade agreements is the extent to which they facilitate travel for trade partners. However, at present, this aspect is not being applied to its full extent as Canada requires visas for citizens from Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. It is therefore important for such an agreement to be reached based on visa reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">Introducing visa-free travel for citizens of all European Union Member States has to be a priority for the remainder of the negotiations. A visa waiver will help establish close ties benefiting both Canada and the European Union as an inseparable whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairness needs to be achieved because, unfortunately, we are witnessing unilateral fairness: Canadian citizens can travel freely in all 27 Member States, whereas, at the same time, some fully-fledged Member States of the European Union are subject to a restriction.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that waiving visa requirements will help strengthen cooperation in business and trade, encourage cultural and scientific exchanges and will allow stronger ties between Canada and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Canada is a partner of the EU in many areas, which means that we must be committed together to removing the barriers which hinder us from achieving our common goal of creating an area of free movement. Achieving this common goal of ours involves removing restrictions and strengthening the principle of reciprocity, which are two elements that can be greatly beneficial to both Canadian and European citizens with whom we are ultimately travelling in the same boat thanks to this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Chapter III of the Charter talks about equality before the law and the banning of discrimination. The European treaties talk of European citizenship. The European Commission likes to be called the Guardian of the Treaties, but it should rather play a much more active role in trying to secure equal access for all European citizens to the fundamental principles of the European treaties and not create ‘second class’ citizens through its inactivity.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2009, Canada imposed a unilateral visa requirement on citizens of the Czech Republic, without any reciprocal measures to date from the EU. The ostensible reason for imposing the visa requirement was the large number of asylum applicants from the Czech Republic. Of course, in view of the fact that other Member States later began ‘supplying’ Canada with large numbers of asylum seekers with no measures whatsoever from the Canadian side, I cannot overlook the Commission’s hesitant and unproductive approach to this matter so far. Is there perhaps some truth in the rumours of a deliberate, informal agreement between the Commissioner and her Canadian counterpart, aimed at avoiding other Member States suffering the same discrimination as my own country? Has the Commission perhaps simply tossed one group of EU citizens overboard? I do not know, and I hope this is not the case. Either way, I hope the Commission will finally heed all of the calls and endeavour to end the visa requirements for some European citizens travelling to Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">On 18 October 2011, Ms Parvanova, Mr Bodu and I sent Canadian Premier Harper a personal letter, warning him that a political link might be made between the unilateral imposition of the visa requirement and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). The letter still remains unanswered. Unless this situation is rapidly resolved, I would not be surprised if there were difficulties over the CETA ratification, and not only in the Czech Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These are the three affected countries today, but this could happen to any other on other occasions. This House, in fact, in its Declaration of 8 March 2011, has already asked the Commission to establish a new mechanism that will guarantee complete reciprocity for all Member States, ensuring that if a third country fails to reciprocate the visa regime, all Member States would enforce obligatory visa requirements for the citizens of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles of reciprocity and solidarity should guide the Union’s policy on visas, whilst also respecting, as is the case here, other debates on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada. Only this way will we achieve a visa policy that is robust, rigorous, credible, supportive and unified.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same manner, I am also aware of the importance of the Union’s foreign relationships, as well as those of the individual Member States; and for that reason, there is a need to find the balance between respect for the principles of reciprocity and solidarity and European trade relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue, as you are aware, has been debated for almost a year within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, via a proposal for the modification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. This would lead to the establishment of a list of the third countries whose citizens require visas to cross borders and a list of third countries whose citizens are exempt from this requirement. I am the rapporteur for this legislative initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The exact objective of this proposal is to provide the Union with an effective and realistic mechanism to resolve conflicts such as those currently being experienced by Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens with Canada. We began the trialogue negotiation stage with the Council a week ago, but I have a strong mandate when it comes to reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is committed and calls for reciprocity. The stances of the three institutions and the Parliament are currently being aligned, but we are all aware of the urgency and the need to reach an agreement that satisfies the interests of all those concerned. Commissioner, I do not believe we can reach this agreement under the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">You are already aware that Parliament only says ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to an international agreement. I will say ‘no’ and will recommend that my political group says ‘no’ if Canada does not absolve the Czechs, Bulgarians and Romanians from the obligation, prior to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Enciu makes a very solid and impeccable argument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a member of the EU-Canada interparliamentary delegation, I have used every opportunity I have had, including sending letters to the Canadian authorities, to support the need to amend the asylum procedure for European citizens to eliminate the constant abuse of this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, Canada finally adopted new immigration legislation, which, in the case of citizens from democratic states, has resulted in a reduction in the period for settling asylum applications from several years to several weeks. I hoped that, once the problem of illegal asylum seekers had been cleared up, Canada would drop visas, as there were no longer any reasons for keeping them. Unfortunately, however, I regret to note that Canadian officials have not changed their tune at all on this issue, which means that the last chance to change this attitude lies in the call for European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">During the second half of this year, the long-negotiated EU-Canada free trade agreement will be submitted to Parliament for approval. This agreement does not currently feature any visa waiver provision. In the context of this debate, I myself and other colleagues who have submitted questions to the Commission want to send a strong message both to the European negotiators, so that they regard the visa problem as a priority, and also to the Canadian Government, so that the European Parliament is not put in the position of rejecting the free trade agreement for the reason that there is no regime allowing the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, the European Parliament is highly sensitive to issues arising from human rights, as has been demonstrated on a huge number of occasions, to the surprise of many. Indeed, in the case of a free trade agreement, we obviously cannot talk about free movement of goods, capital and services while not having the free movement of persons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to believe that the forthcoming reform of the Canadian asylum laws will remove the concerns of Canadians regarding the abuse of their social system by citizens of certain European countries and will pave the way for visa-free travel for all EU citizens to Canada. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will come back to the restriction of visa freedom in a moment. However, it should be up to each sovereign state to decide for itself who shall benefit from travel facilitation. Accordingly, Romania and Bulgaria are likewise free to decide whether they want to make it easier or more difficult for particular countries’ citizens to get into their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider Canada’s asylum policy – which makes a clear distinction between applicants from democratic and undemocratic countries – to be a sensible one. By its very definition, an asylum seeker can only be someone who comes from a country in which he or she is persecuted, which can hardly apply in the case of democratic EU countries. The EU should rather learn from the example of Canada’s asylum policy. Canada was and remains a fundamentally generous country when it comes to immigration. However, if you have had negative experiences of so-called tourists who then disappear, people who exploit your hospitality and confuse it with freedom of establishment, then I can quite understand why even Canada has concerns about this kind of immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Canada is a country with which we have a special relationship. It is a friend and an ally on many issues, and it is in both Canada’s interest and our interest that we try to deepen the relationship in all possible ways. That is why this visa issue is so frustrating, and I share your frustration here.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Commission is doing everything it can to make sure that there will be full visa freedom between Canada and the EU, in both directions. I have, on numerous occasions, raised this issue with the Canadian authorities, indeed with the Minister himself, and so have my colleagues in the Commission and many of the Commission’s officials. We hope that the issue between Romania and Bulgaria, on the one hand, and Canada, on the other, can be solved very soon when Romania and Bulgaria enter the Schengen cooperation system. Meanwhile, the immigration bill should enter into force by the end of this year, so there should be a possibility of breaking the deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue we are following very, very closely and we have made clear to our Canadian counterparts that visa reciprocity is a key issue for us in the Commission, for Member States, for the European Parliament and for our citizens.

<p class="contents">I think the message from this plenary has been very clearly heard, and we will continue on the Commission side to push this issue. It will also be part of the discussion on a new EU-Canada framework agreement, and we will set up a working group with the countries concerned, the Commission and the Canadian authorities.

Trade agreements always seek mutual benefit and are as pragmatic as possible. This is why discussing principles and values during trade negotiations is often regarded as a sign of bad taste. I call for us to drop the good manners and ask our Canadian partners the following: Do you think that there are first and second class Europeans? How else can we explain your deliberate refusal to treat all European citizens equally?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always prided itself in being a ‘Union of values’. Member States’ equality under the Treaties is declared in Article 3 of the Lisbon Treaty. This point needs to be defended because the contempt it is being shown touches the EU’s very foundations. We have sufficient mechanisms available to request that the principle of visa reciprocity be applied to Canada. Ensuring visa-free travel for all European citizens is a priority for all European institutions. Canada must lift its visa restrictions on Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic. I call on MEPs not to forget this when the trade agreement between the EU and Canada returns to this Chamber for our approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am still taken aback by the attitude of the European Commission, which is doing what suits the Canadians, and effectively failing to prevent discrimination against the countries concerned. The European Parliament warned of the danger that international agreements with Canada would not be approved two years ago in a written declaration which I initiated. This is not an empty warning, as the Czech Parliament has already blocked an aviation agreement on account of this situation. Czech MPs are planning to block the trade agreement for the duration of the visa non-reciprocity, which celebrated its third anniversary in July. I do not consider it effective to set up a working party to look at the large increase in unfounded asylum applications, since the core of the problem lies in Canadian asylum law, and not in the EU Member States. Moreover, a working party was set up between Canada and the Czech Republic in 2009, with the participation of the Commission, and it brought no progress. I call on the Commission to support the amendment proposed by myself and other MEPs for a regulation on the visa obligations of third countries as a way of putting effective, visible and firm pressure on Canada, failing which the EU will threaten future complications in Europe-Canada relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
