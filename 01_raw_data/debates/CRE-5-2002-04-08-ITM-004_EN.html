<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Deprez (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, sport in general, and football in particular, occupy a very special position in society, both in defining behaviour and in the collective imagination. The crowds which regularly travel to big matches, and big international matches, in particular – as well as the number of television viewers – is quite simply staggering.</p>
<p class="contents">Professional football today is highly popular; it is a massive game, a massive spectacle and, it has to be said, a massive business. Too often, unfortunately, the big matches – and especially the big international matches – are also the stage on which unacceptable aggression, rioting and violence are acted out with scant regard for sporting principles or the respect due to persons and property.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, no Member State totally escapes the risk of disturbances, even if some international matches are more sensitive than others and the supporters of some clubs or national teams are seemingly easier to control than others. It is precisely in order to more effectively prevent and control the risk of disturbances during international competitions that the Kingdom of Belgium took the initiative to put forward a proposal for a Council decision on which we are due to vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision is based on three observations. First of all, the number of football matches taking place at international level is currently increasing rapidly, such as the various European competitions, the European Championship and other tournaments, which, owing to the increase in the number of travelling supporters, entails greater risk of disturbances, or even violence, during competitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second observation is, in order to prevent disturbances and to maintain law and order in connection with football matches is to have, first and foremost, it is essential to have an organised and efficient system for exchanging information regarding the risks that some matches present – and more specifically, certain types of supporters who travel to matches – and therefore, secondly, to improve coordination between the organisations responsible for security. In this respect, we must recognise that the current system of cooperation between police forces, based on non-binding agreements and ad hoc contacts fostered at each match, has demonstrated its weakness if not its inefficiency. It is also unreliable, slow and inconsistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision proposes that each Member State formally establishes or designates a police-run national football information centre to act as a single, central and direct point of contact between the authorities and the police force of the Member States responsible for ensuring security at international football matches or competition with an international dimension. Each national football information centre must therefore have the necessary resources and qualified staff. It goes without saying that the operational needs are not the same in Finland, Austria, France, Germany, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands. The various national information points that are established or designated must therefore function as information exchange networks providing data of a general nature – such as the number of supporters travelling, high-risk groups, the presence of hard core groups – and personal data, in other words, supporters posing risks to law and order and security.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting the proposed report, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs gave its approval to the broad guidelines of this proposal for a Council decision. It also approved 19 amendments, which all seek either to strengthen the operational nature of the network or, Mrs Buitenweg, to increase the protection of citizens when exchanging personal information.</p>
<p class="contents">If it adopts the report, the House will demonstrate its will to combat hooliganism more effectively and, in doing so, it will help professional football to confirm its main purpose, which is to provide enthusiastic supporters with a high standard of play, thus preventing a handful of savages from turning stadiums and host cities into training camps for rioters or battle grounds for rival gangs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was not an easy task, because the Council continuously submitted updated versions. Despite this, he succeeded in presenting a sound report on this important matter in which citizens feel very closely involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly endorse his proposal as long as it deals with the proper exchange of information and better coordination with the bodies that are responsible for security at football matches. It would certainly benefit efficiency if information were to be centralised within one establishment for each Member State, which could then act as a port of call for all those involved. This is essential, and works very well in the Netherlands, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to warn you, however, that the privacy and personal rights of the individual supporter may not be flouted in the process. Article 4(3) is of crucial importance. National and international legislation forms the basis for collecting, exchanging and using information. Acting against actual football violence should fall within the remit of the judiciary and not of sports bodies that organise football matches.</p>
<p class="contents">Controlling football vandalism, however, is not only a matter of more effective police action. In my view, it is far more important to change the mentality of the supporter. Sport and both professional and amateur football fulfil a broad, social function. Experts have ascertained that football-related violence originates, for example, in the pursuit of masculinity and status and the battle for territory. This must change, and clubs, supporters’ associations and the players themselves clearly have a role to play in this. In addition, the UEFA has a major role. This organisation knows – as no other – the problems which can occur, through its close contacts with the national football bodies and extensive experience in organising football matches. I should like to call on them to cooperate. I should also like to urge the national information points to closely involve sports clubs, supporters’ associations and the UEFA in its activities, so that these can be implemented as well and effectively as possible so as to enhance security at football matches with an international dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I would like to respond on behalf of Mr Cashman who is a Socialist Group shadow on this report and cannot attend this evening. He would like to inform the House that the PSE Group welcomes this report and the measures in it intended to prevent the activities of hooligans and organised thugs at matches. We will, however, need to monitor the way these monitoring centres carry out their functions to ensure that the football community is fully engaged in the exchange of information. Most important of all is the need to ensure adequate resources both in financial and personnel terms. It would be wrong to raise expectations to a level which cannot be met. We can, of course, defeat hooliganism. The proposals indicate we have the will to do the job, but the resources must follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to intervene personally in this debate. I too would like to add my support to Mr Deprez's report and its amendments, specifically, his amendment 10 calling for closer cooperation and an organised exchange of information. If the European network of national football information centres is to be effective, then we need to address the current weaknesses in the system of information exchange and ad hoc contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">On Friday, I visited the football intelligence unit in the Greater Manchester police service. Unfortunately, we have a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling football-related violence in my city. The assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police has read this report and he welcomes the initiative in the light of what he calls "different standards in dealing, for example, with Manchester United away fixtures and England away fixtures". On Friday the unit was preparing for two key matches on Saturday. One of those was Oldham versus Stoke City: the last time these two teams had met, known hooligans had rampaged through the town, wrecking property and attacking people. In the UK we have pro-active football legislation to deal with our hooligan problems. This allows us to impose banning orders; so, when a hundred of those fans arrived in Oldham, they were immediately arrested because they are banned from attending any matches. Those banning orders also apply to international matches.</p>
<p class="contents">The football intelligence unit has a sophisticated database of so-called 'football prominents', using the latest digital image technology to update and record cases. Let me tell you where the unit believes the EU information exchange system has to do better: 150 fans were deported from Charleroi in June 2000. Among those arriving in Manchester airport were Belgian nationals, some of whom may not have been involved in any hooliganism at all. Rounding up and deportation without prosecution does nothing to help the intelligence network on hooliganism. A list of, and report on, the deportees was then sent to the intelligence unit: very helpful as far as it went, but the report contained no information. Officers could not read it because it was not in English, and they could not act on it because the information did not allow for any further action due to prosecution or conviction. During Euro 1996, German fans arrived in Manchester. As a result of German data protection and privacy laws, no lists of known hooligans could be passed on to the local intelligence forces and the officers working in the unit therefore had no information accessible in a usable format to tackle the hooligans. So there is an issue here, Commissioner, in that we do need to standardise our information formats while recognising that there are different cultures on policing and information collection across the EU. Perhaps we need to consider some form of information protocol. This was the idea of my own football intelligence unit officers.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to deal with hooliganism pro-actively not re-actively. On the issue of cost, which is an amendment tabled by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, no doubt it would be useful to have a study on whether clubs should pay more for the policing of hooliganism. The difficulty is, however, who pays those costs after hours in cities where football hooligans are still engaged in activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 we will be hosting the final of the European championships at Old Trafford in Manchester. Our priority has to be to protect the law-abiding supporter and clamp down on hooligans who spoil the game. We need a practical, pro-active approach to information sharing for national monitoring centres. Their existence alone, Commissioner, will not guarantee the end of football hooliganism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal and report are sound, and the initiative is excellent in my view. I should, however, like to make two observations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the proposal only applies, of course, to EU Member States. You may ask, what about the countries outside the European Union, many of whose clubs also take part in international competitions? Turkey, Romania and Croatia also play teams of the EU Member States. I hear you say that candidate countries will obviously need to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, and that is right. But that is not now nor in the immediate future. For some of them, that is not until 2004 at the earliest. And then, what about the others? What about the non-candidate countries? It may be possible to link up with the UEFA and with the national football unions, to find a way round this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, greater involvement and cooperation by the clubs and supporters’ associations is important to improve the climate and the quality. And I believe that specific efforts must be made in order to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Council decision is first of all directed at a hard core which, so far, has been able to exploit the loopholes in the exchange of information between the different police services. The effective coordination of the exchange of information is therefore not an unnecessary luxury. However, let it be clear that this is, first and foremost, a preventive instrument which must allow for effective risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, Mr Deprez’ report is very good. He managed to clarify the original text and also to tighten it up, by, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, devoting more attention to the times before and after the games.</p>
<p class="contents">A well-oiled network of ‘football’ information points must be able to deploy forces in a targeted and effective manner. The international football competition takes up a great deal of energy and resources of the police services involved, resulting in the risk that other tasks may be carried out to a lower standard.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question surrounding instruments of this nature, however, is how the law-enforcing bodies themselves can be monitored. An almost self-evident first step in this is to inform the individuals involved about the fact that they have ended up in this database and to grant them access to this. A counter-argument could be that this could hamper the monitoring function of the police services and offer the people included on the database a tactical advantage. I, however, believe this to be a misapprehension about what actually happens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not purely about a self-evident right, namely that of knowing whether or not you are included in a database. It is also about issuing a clear warning which also has a deterrent effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not that, though, with which we are dealing here, for the protection of fundamental rights –which I believe to be threatened by this proposal – only makes sense if it applies to all the people in a State, and not only to those whose thoughts and actions enjoy the State's approval.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the so-called area of freedom, security and justice, the Deprez report aims at the actual gathering of more information on football hooligans. Over and over again during discussions on the proposal, the rapporteur disputed that this would, in the long term, entail travel bans, preventive custody and the infringement of fundamental rights, as no measures are envisaged over and above the collection of data.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take an example from the country in which I was elected in order to make clear how, in my view, it will certainly not, in the long term, remain just a matter of gathering data. In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, there has already been a legal document, according to which hooligans who are allegedly equipped for violence may have their right to leave the country restricted. A year ago, though, that was used, not against hooligans, but against people who were equipped to demonstrate and wanted to travel to Genoa. Some of those who had originally voted for this law have since said in the media that this was far from being what they wanted. They had, they said, voted for the law at that time only on the presupposition that it really only applied to football hooligans, and not to people who wanted to express their political views.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this shows very well what can happen to documents of this sort. I would be surprised if this really were only about the gathering of data, for what is a database for if nothing is done with it afterwards? It is very easy to see through the political manoeuvre that lies behind it. A new target group – the hooligans – has been found, which is well suited to legitimising police measures in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, and thus measures are justified which very definitely restrict the protection of fundamental rights and which are then extended to other people. This, then, means in the long term that this will not just be a matter of gathering data, but that travel restrictions, preventive detention and so on will very definitely find their way into this ‘fortress Europe’ policy, which will then be applied to other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to give your approval to that, if that is your understanding of the area of freedom, security and justice, then you should indeed vote in favour of the Deprez report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without doubt, the commercialisation of football and the profit motive are the prime cause of violent episodes at football matches. Brawls are no longer led by wild crowds of fans, they are led by organised mafias using fanaticism and violence to serve specific illegal purposes which have nothing to do with the love of sport. In short, it has been suggested that violence at football matches sells, it brings in a profit. Violence at football matches is organised and orchestrated nowadays, frequently using sport as a front for common crime, such as selling drugs and laundering dirty money, according to an investigation carried out in Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, various groups of hooligans have been making blatant use of new technology, mobile telephones and the Internet, to organise their activities and, of course, to mislead the police. This being the case, we cannot create a European area of freedom, security and justice unless we first create a network of information points and reinforce police and judicial cooperation between the 15 Member States in order to suppress violence at football matches.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the sports associations still have a crucial role to play in distancing themselves from hooliganism and teaching their fans the importance of friendly competition, collaboration, dialogue, respect for other people's differences and peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens will be a important opportunity to revive the Olympic spirit and the ideals of the Olympic truce and peace, as an alternative political proposal to the mindset and culture of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that the scourge of violence, often organised violence, has plagued international sport, particularly international football, for too long. We wholeheartedly support initiatives that are aimed at increasing cooperation between authorities in different Member States. They are a vital tool in the battle to keep sport clean and to keep it as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We like you to consider one small, but important, textual amendment. The proposed decision is flawed in one respect: it appears to assume that each Member State is represented by just one single national team. This is not so, as you well know. My own country, for example, is represented by an independent Scotland team, despite the fact that Scotland is, for the time being anyway, not an independent Member State. We have a long footballing pedigree and indeed the first international football match ever played was the game between Scotland and England in 1872. Scottish supporters – the so-called 'Tartan Army' which is tartan, but not an army – have for quite a few years now had an unparalleled reputation for good behaviour and good humour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I and my EFA colleagues have tabled three amendments to the Council text. They will not change the substance but they will give recognition to the distinctive footballing and indeed legal histories of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. Do not speak about the national team, but about national <span class="italic">teams</span>. I see Mr Deprez accepts the point and I am most grateful to him for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly that we, unlike Mrs Schröder, are very much interested in 22 men running in shorts after a ball. And secondly, that our group also wants to seriously address the problems surrounding these matches.</p>
<p class="contents">I too should like to bring one amendment to your attention which has already been touched upon by my fellow MEP, because I hope that you are still prepared to endorse it. It concerns the amendment which stipulates that, if data is stored about persons who constitute a danger to public order, these persons should be informed of the fact that their data has been recorded. This is a different situation from that in the case of criminals, for example. I can imagine that, in the case of criminals, it is not helpful if, while the investigations are still under way, they know that they are being pursued. In the case of persons who constitute a danger to public order, however, it has a very preventive effect. They know that they are being monitored. As a result, anyone who has been wrongly registered can be removed from this register, but it also acts as an effective deterrent, in fact. If people know that they are being watched, they will think twice before misbehaving again in this way. I hope you will be able to endorse Amendment No 22, nevertheless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I might even say that this example will be a source of inspiration, which can be applied to other areas. Belgium’s initiative is based on a detailed assessment of the European Football Championships of 2000, which has been supported and financed by the Commission’s OISIN programme and in which the Commission participated. In our opinion, establishing national football information points and their close cooperation could be an effective means of predicting and combating outbreaks of hooliganism in football.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the initiative is to enable Member States to exchange information on groups of football team supporters and on their trips to other countries, and even to be able to exchange information on whether these groups should be classified as peaceful or violent. The aim of this exchange of information is above all to help countries organising football matches to prevent potential outbreaks of violence and to guarantee the safety of all true lovers of this sport who wish to attend football matches.</p>
<p class="contents">The innovative aspect of this decision is that, in addition to enabling the existing exchange of information to continue, it is legally binding, which means that it is a step towards increasing legal security in the processing of this information. Since this involves the exchange of information on personal data, we must take great care over the way in which this is processed and safeguarded, considering above all that not only the rules of international law in force on the protection of privacy apply to these exchanges of information but that, in the opinion of the Commission, we should also incorporate this exchange of information into a legal instrument that regulates the protection of personal data in all matters pertaining to the third pillar, in other words, in all matters pertaining to judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking Mr Deprez for being such a good sport in presenting this report and by giving my special thanks to Mr McCormick for the historical information about the first game of football being played in 1872 between Scotland and England, although I am sorry he did not tell us who won …</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
