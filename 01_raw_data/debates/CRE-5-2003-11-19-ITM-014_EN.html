<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, the next summit meeting between the European Union and Canada was scheduled to take place on 17 December 2003 in Ottawa. The timing of the summit has now been called into doubt. The Commission understands that the presidency has difficulties with the date proposed. The Commission attaches very great importance to this summit with Canada and is ready to do anything it can to ensure that it takes place. Since this difficulty has arisen, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien has announced his intention to step down from office on 12 December. It therefore seems unlikely that the date of 17 December can be maintained. However, the Commission remains hopeful that a solution can be found so that our final summit meeting with Prime Minister Chrétien can indeed take place before his retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put a lot of work into preparing for this summit, which will be the last hosted by Prime Minister Chrétien, a long-standing true friend of Europe. We intend to use this occasion to demonstrate the strong ties that bind the European Union and Canada, and to signal our common intention to strengthen those ties still further in the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission welcomes the statement issued by the Chairman of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association, on the occasion of the recent EU-Canada interparliamentary meeting in Ottawa. The Commission was gratified to note the great degree of consensus between the chairman's statement, the recent conclusions of the Council of Ministers and the Commission's own communication of May 2003 on EU-Canada relations.</p>
<p class="contents">As the chairman's statement observed, the EU and Canada agreed at last year's Ottawa Summit, to undertake a comprehensive review of the bilateral relationship during 2003 and to report back to the December summit this year. The Commission is working hard, alongside the presidency and with our Canadian counterparts, to finalise a joint report to go to the summit. This report will take up many of the themes developed by the Commission, Council and Parliament in their contributions to the review.</p>
<p class="contents">A driving force behind the review is the changing nature of the EU-Canada relationship. Given the changing nature of the European Union itself, Canada was the first industrialised third country to enter into a formal relationship with the European Economic Community in 1976. As a result, the EU-Canada relationship has tended to focus on trade and economic issues. However, Canada and the EU's common interests extend far beyond the commercial arena. We share similar social models and global interests. Canada, like the European Union, is a staunch advocate of the United Nations, the multilateral system and the international rule of law. By way of example, Canada voted with the European Union 96% of the time during the current UN General Assembly, on those occasions when the European Union had a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to find ways of working together more systematically in the field of security and foreign policy so that we can be more effective in carrying forward those policies where our objectives coincide. We also want to improve our dialogue in other policy areas where we often share common values and face similar challenges. These areas include education and culture, the environment and justice and home affairs. We have also maintained our focus on the very important economic relationship that exists between Canada and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is Canada's second most important trading partner after the United States. We are the second source of foreign investment in Canada. In parallel with our comprehensive review of all aspects of EU-Canada relations, we have also been developing the framework for a new type of bilateral trade and investment agreement, with the aim of facilitating trade and investment flows between the EU and Canada. Commissioner Lamy and the Canadian Trade Minister, Mr Pettigrew, will report to the December summit on the results of their analysis into the potential scope of such an agreement. We expect talks to begin immediately in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission believes that an intensified dialogue between European and Canadian parliamentarians is essential to maintain the good health of our relationship. The Commission is grateful for the work of Parliament's Canada delegation and hopes that other Members and committees, working on specific policy areas, will also give consideration to increasing contact with their Canadian counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between the EU and Canada is very healthy. The European Commission is resolved to do all it can to keep it that way. We want the summit to lift this relationship to a new plateau, at a challenging time for the international community and in preparation for major changes taking place in Canada and within the European Union in the coming month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You mentioned, Commissioner, that our models of society are identical or very similar. It is indeed the case that Canada is a large country endeavouring not only to permit but also to promote cultural diversity within itself, and so certain analogies with the situation in the European Union present themselves, since our structure differs from, say, the United States of America. Cultural diversity is present in our European Union too, a diversity that will become even more marked following the accession of new countries next year.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned, Commissioner, that we have the same global interests, and this goes hand in hand with the other aspect you mentioned, our shared social model. Our global interests are in the field of foreign and security policy. Particularly after 11 September, we have to engage in a global cultural dialogue, for a clash of civilizations, a <span class="italic">choc des civilisations</span> will get us nowhere. In the final analysis, international terrorism cannot be fought by military means.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to mention another aspect, which is that although Canada, that great country, is in North America, it is one in which French is spoken. Intercultural dialogue, especially between the United States of America and the Islamic world, grinds to a halt if it is conducted only in English. I think there is great potential if France joins Canada in promoting such dialogue. Canada can be a mediator between the USA and the Islamic world. Not least is this in the interests of our most important partner, the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by adding that I believe that our relationship with Canada functions as a model. Now that the Iron Curtain has ceased to be, we are quite right to work towards a balanced relationship with Central and Eastern Europe and also with those Eastern European countries that will very probably never belong to the European Union, especially with Russia. We must never forget, though, that we must continue to look westwards; not only to the USA, but to our great ally Canada. Together with Canada, we must work towards global equilibrium in a multipolar world, and I believe that a productive relationship with Canada in this process is something the significance of which cannot be overestimated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, David (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, it is interesting that we are discussing EU-Canada relations on the same day as Mr George Bush is visiting the United Kingdom and trumpeting the so-called special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In the corner of the UK that I come from, the special relationship is not with the United States of America but with Canada. There are very few Scottish families that do not have a relative, however distant, living in Canada. So the ties that bind Scotland and Canada are much stronger, I would argue, than the ties that bind the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also true for other parts of the European Union. As Mr Schröder, rightly says, the French have a natural affinity to Canada, the Irish also, and when with enlargement on the horizon, the Poles and the Baltic States too have many relatives and many connections with Canada. So the EU's relationship with Canada is extremely important and we should do everything possible to nurture it.</p>
<p class="contents">It was therefore with some sadness I heard the Commissioner inform us tonight that the summit looks like it could be cancelled. I know from my contacts with Canadians that Prime Minister Chrétien, a very good friend of Europe, believed that holding this EU-Canada summit would be one of the crowing points of his final few weeks in office. It would be a slap in the face to a good friend of Europe if this summit does not go ahead in some shape or form. It does not matter to him, to me, or to the Commission whether that summit is held in Europe or whether it is held in Canada. The important thing is that it happens before 12 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Canada is important for a variety of reasons and I shall be telegraphic in saying this because Mr Vitorino and Mr Schröder have already outlined some of those. The links that we have are important for cultural and historical reasons. I was hoping that the summit would nurture further exchanges between young people so that we can retain those existing links and build upon them for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and Canada are natural partners on the world stage. We both value, in a way that some other countries do not, the multilateral institutions of the world and we value the international rule of law. Much is to be gained by working with our Canadian partners on issues as diverse as the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and the Doha trade negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, as the Commissioner rightly outlined, our economic and trade relations are good. Importantly, they are good in a two-way sense: it is not a one-way trading relationship. Canada's willingness to reach an agreement on trade in wine and spirits demonstrates the goodwill that characterises our relationship with the Canadians.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on justice and home affairs, we have a common approach to issues as diverse as terrorism, migration, asylum and border controls, as well as issues of the integration of migrants. I hope - and I address this to Commissioner Vitorino - that we can find a solution to Canada's desire to have a longer visa period for Canadian citizens visiting the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I share the Commission's view about the EU's relationship with Canada. I hope that this House will join with the European Commission in stressing to the Council the importance of the summit going ahead in some shape or form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would be forgiven for thinking over these last months that Europe has only one transatlantic relationship, so often do we use that term to describe the link between our Union and the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, once said that living next to America was like 'sleeping with an elephant'. Even its smallest movements were likely to keep you awake at night. Europe's own sensitivity to the movements of the current American elephant can all too easily overshadow our relations with its northern neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-Canada summit is a chance to renew this relationship. The European Union and Canada have a long history of productive cooperation to build on. We share the same views on the best strategy for defeating international terrorism and international organised crime. We are common supporters of NATO, the UN and the ICC. We share a strong commitment to Third World development assistance and environmental protection. Both the EU and Canada have ratified the Kyoto protocols, and led the call for others to do so. The Ottawa Land Mines Convention expresses our joint abhorrence of these weapons and our determination to act.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a time when Canada sought actively bilateral trading links with Europe as a way of reducing its dependence on trade with the United States. It would be facile to see NAFTA as Canada's surrender to economic destiny. Canadians continue to invest significantly in Europe: almost EUR 65 billion last year. In return, we provide over a quarter of foreign investment in Canada. We take almost 20% of Canada's service-related exports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's strategy document dwells rightly on the good will which exists between us, but identifies rightly that very little positive action flows from it. We must deliver such action. High level meetings between Canada and the EU have too often lacked clear objectives. This summit should re-launch our relations on much more proactive terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has recognised this, in making the negotiation of an ambitious new accord one of the priorities of its tenure. For this reason, it is extraordinary that the President-in-Office of the Council has chosen not to accompany his delegation. I have been told by Canadian diplomats this evening that Mr Berlusconi's tactless decision has led Canada to consider cancelling the summit altogether, or to reschedule it for a European venue earlier in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of this summit and its established place in Europe's diplomatic calendar, Mr Berlusconi has shown an unacceptable willingness to offend our friends in Ottawa. For the second time in as many weeks he has embarrassed the Union, and in this case offended a valuable ally.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR urges strongly that the summit goes ahead in December as planned, preferably in Canada, and in Europe only as a last resort. Even in Mr Berlusconi's absence, this summit must deliver an agreement that takes away regulatory barriers to closer trade and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of our large store of common North Atlantic values, this summit should assert that Canada and the EU will henceforth cooperate proactively in foreign and security policy and on environmental questions. This means aligning our positions before major international meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit must also produce concrete proposals for a steering group to assess the future management of our relationship. We need more formal meetings at official and expert level, and a much more focused relationship. As soon as a Constitutional settlement is achieved, the 1976 Framework Agreement with Canada should be updated.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is time to equip our other transatlantic relationship for the new century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
