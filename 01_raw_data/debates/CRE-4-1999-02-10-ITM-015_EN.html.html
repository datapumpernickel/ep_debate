<p class="contents">The first is that the Union must defend its internal law, which is an expression of its autonomy. It is being attacked by rules such as Section 301, that are applied with extraterritorial effect and that are used to defend interests rather than rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the need to guarantee that the arbitration procedures are effective. These have been used against the Union in the past and now, due to circumstances, they are being called into question because of the unilateral protectionist measures that have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Both questions lead us to the conclusion that we are pursuing an open market policy that is not reciprocated and that benefits the United States. The US not only wants European markets to be open to products from the United States; they must also be open in the way that the United States dictates.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that we maintain the Union"s legislative autonomy; in this case, the COM for bananas is symbolic. What we are trying to do is to assert the Union"s autonomy.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite the far‐reaching concessions granted by the European Union during the reform of the COM, this new regime continues to be attacked by the United States which basically wants it to be dismantled. I must point out that, at the time, we fought against those concessions as they undermine the basic principle of Community preference.</p>
<p class="contents">The threats now being made by the United States, in total defiance of the rules governing the multilateral trading system, are coming directly after the establishment of the transatlantic partnership. The UPE Group is therefore calling for an appropriate response from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the European Union can under no circumstances be subject to United States sanctions if no decision has been made by the relevant bodies of the WTO, in accordance with the applicable procedures guaranteeing the observance of due process. If the Americans were to go down the road of unilateral action, they should realise that they would bear a heavy responsibility for weakening the international trading system.</p>

Some Members have already addressed certain questions and I assume that others here present will be referring to many of the details. If the consequences of these fresh disputes with the United States were not so serious, this quarrel might seem amusing. But the consequences are very serious and I hope that we will reach a satisfactory solution in the very near future, otherwise we would seriously jeopardise transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you: the European Union and the United States did most to initiate the dispute‐settlement procedure within the WTO. This procedure may not be perfect in every way and may need to be developed further but it is the only international instrument we have to resolve trade disputes. The United States doubts whether the new banana market organisation is WTO compatible. That is indeed its right. But it does not have the right to take unilateral measures against its trade partners and to issue sanctions, such as in this case the absurd 100 % duties on products from EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not have the right to take it upon itself to deliver a verdict. The conduct of the United States does considerable damage to the WTO dispute settlement procedure. It makes the preliminary negotiations for the new WTO round considerably more difficult and it damages confidence in the process of transatlantic partnership. It gives the impression that the American margin for play in trade policy is increasingly determined by a purely national political agenda, which causes justified fears that it is trying to impose a particular American trade philosophy worldwide. That is playing with fire and puts the WTO itself in the firing line. Protectionism must not always be seen as the solution to national problems. In the scheme of things we are all dependent on one another and the WTO is an instrument for harmonising egoistic national approaches. It is not beloved of everyone, it is not perfect, but it is extremely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">To approach national issues, such as bananas, hormones and many others I could mention, in emotional political terms, takes the reason out of politics as a whole and sets in motion a trend that may not be stoppable. My group fully supports the Commission"s position. You have before you an appropriate joint resolution from the Committee on External Economic Relations that strongly rejects the unilateral measures taken by the United States, fully supports the Commission and, moreover, in my view can form a good basis for further European policy measures.</p>

<p class="contents">Faced with the determined stance of the Americans, who are skilfully playing a double game with their European partners by seeking both partnership and sanctions, the European institutions appear divided, powerless, paralysed and reluctant to truly defend European interests.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the American desire for domination is not perceived as such by many Member States. Secondly, the 15 Member States increasingly appear to have divergent interests. And thirdly, the absence of democracy within the European institutions is ensuring that any complicity is obscured.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that we are faced with a situation in which the United States has unilaterally decided to publish a list of European products which it intends to sanction by raising customs duties to 100 % if the EU does not amend its new banana import regime. In addition, they have taken this decision even before the WTO has decided whether or not this regime is compatible with its rules.</p>

The real test will come when the EU bans meat containing hormones in a few weeks" time. Next on the cards – and here too Mr Weaver did not mince his words – will come genetic manipulation. Under the pretext of offering the consumer a wider choice, US firms are to be allowed to put genetically modified tomatoes and laboratory‐made soya on our supermarket shelves. And if possible they will not label it as such, since the poor consumer might find it too hard to take in so much information!</p>
<p class="contents">The issue goes far beyond bananas. That is precisely why we cannot give way to the unjustified US demand, even though and in fact just because they are threatening lunatic sanctions. After one WTO panel we revised the organisation of the banana market. Whether that revised regime is compatible with the rules is something that same panel will decide again. Any form of US sanction against European firms prior to the panel"s findings would deprive the WTO of all meaning. If any penalty duty is imposed before the panel"s findings, we might as well shut down the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately the Commission has to take some of the blame for this situation. The founders of the WTO manoeuvred themselves into this position because world trade is not being regulated according to the principle of sustainable development, consumer protection and social protection. Instead the ruling principles are economic growth and profit seeking. With a view to the forthcoming millennium round, it is high time to formulate concrete reform proposals. Precautionary measures, the environment and local development must become the guiding principles of economic action. At the high‐level WTO meetings in March, the Commission ought to begin by submitting the appropriate documents if it really wants, as promised, to make transparency the primary obligation of EU officials. Today"s protests in front of Parliament by the French farmers have given some idea of what they think of the adjustment to the world market and the mania for liberalisation and deregulation, as also what they will be capable of once they really get going.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liese </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the Group of the European People"s Party supports the joint resolution. We consider it most important for the WTO rules to be observed. It is absolutely unacceptable for the USA to threaten unilateral measures again European firms that really have nothing at all to do with the banana market organisation, with the dispute about it. It is also entirely unacceptable for US policy to give in to the pressure from Chiquita and others. We must support the Commission in its demand for respect for the WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">But the EU must also respect the WTO rules, which means that if we lose again at the next panel, we will have to revise the market organisation again. I would ask the Commission to consider how we will react if that happens. For myself, I would say that I do not regard this as a good organisation of the market. It discriminates against producers in Latin America and it does not protect small producers against the multinationals, as is said so often, for there are small, independent producers in Latin America too. In Ecuador, 60 % of producers have fewer than 20 hectares, and they are owned nationally, not owned Chiquita.</p>
<p class="contents">In Costa Rica there are fair‐trade bananas, and the organisation of the market discriminates against all of them. For Commissioner Pinheiro actually to say two weeks ago in regard to my report on bananas that the Commission should give the multinationals in the ACP states money to build up banana plantations is pure hypocrisy, if at the same time we say we want to defend the small producers against the big shots. Perhaps quite different issues are at stake here. But that should not prevent us from insisting again and again that the WTO rules must be respected and that we cannot accept the US attacks. Nor can we accept the US views on hormone‐containing meat and on the question of genetically modified organisms. Here we must stand up for our legislation. But should we find that our legislation is not compatible with the WTO rules, then indeed we have to revise it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw Sir Leon Brittan"s attention to the debate we have just held on the Bowe report. There the committee proposed an amendment to the effect that we should take account of socio‐economic criteria when authorising genetically modified organisms. I believe that if that amendment is adopted and has an influence on the legislation, it will be a through ball for the Americans. We have to prove on the basis of scientific evidence that our policy is the right one, and this applies both to the hormone issue and to GMOs. We regard the precautionary principle as the foundation of our policy, not some arbitrary socio‐economic criteria. Here too we must take care we do not come up against new problems in the autumn.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the support that Parliament has given generally to the Commission on this issue and also thanking it for the resolution that has been drafted, which we find very supportive.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions raised two key issues: what is the Commission doing to avoid the threatened US sanctions and, if sanctions are nevertheless applied, what does it intend to do then? All our actions, both present and future, are and will be taken in full compliance with WTO rules. Two wrongs do not make a right. That does not, however, mean, that we are powerless. American sanctions are illegal because they are based on a unilateral determination that the European Community has failed to bring the banana regime into compliance with WTO rules. We have therefore sought to persuade the Americans to submit the question of the conformity of the new banana regime to a WTO panel procedure, in accordance with Article 21(5). In fact, WTO procedures make this an obligatory step before any sanctions can be authorised.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as last September, and in the weeks and months following, we offered to reduce the WTO procedure to an absolute minimum of time. We even initiated the procedure ourselves, inviting the United States to participate. But the fundamental problem is that, at the end of the Uruguay Round, the US Administration promised Congress that it would take sanctions immediately at the end of the period for implementation of the WTO panel ruling in application of the domestic Section 301 procedure. The Administration now has to prove that it can deliver. That is the simple American political background. The United States has, therefore, ignored the fact that where there is disagreement between the parties, the conformity of implementing measures must first be tested through the obligatory WTO procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the bananas case the American Administration promised Congress to implement sanctions at the latest by 3 March 1999 whatever happens in the WTO! That is what ties the hands of the US Administration. That is why the United States has refused to participate in any WTO procedure on the conformity of the new EC banana regime simply because that would have taken the Americans beyond their self‐imposed internal deadline, which does not comply with WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">By initiating the Article 21(5) procedure ourselves, we succeeded in bringing Ecuador to launch its own procedure to challenge the conformity of our regime. This procedure is now under way and panel reports are due by 12 April. After this, the normal procedures provide that the other side has the right to appeal. Meanwhile, the US has continued to press for authorisation to take retaliatory measures by 3 March. There has been a major debate on this, in which almost all the WTO members who spoke supported <span class="italic">our</span> position that there cannot be authorisation of retaliation in the absence of a WTO ruling on the conformity of the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We will now continue to argue before the arbitrator that he can only determine the level of any retaliatory action if and when the non‐conformity of the new banana regime has been determined. Otherwise, the arbitrator would be sentencing the European Community while its guilt has not been proven.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also asked the WTO General Council to give an authoritative interpretation on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are challenging the conformity of the American Section 301 legislation. We have requested a panel which will, in due course, be set up. The US, from its side, has requested consultations with us and we will enter those consultations in good faith.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the second question: what would we do if the Americans go ahead with sanctions on 3 March? Firstly, we would challenge the legality of those sanctions through the WTO dispute settlement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as long as those sanctions lasted, we would have the option of retaliating, quite legally, by withdrawing concessions or imposing measures in areas not covered by WTO disciplines. There are such measures that could be imposed and we would be entitled and would give the most serious consideration to applying them in the face of such flagrant breach of the law.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Smith </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, we support the Commission view that the unilateral action by the United States is illegal as it is outrageous and totally irresponsible. Its very threat is already causing severe damage to cashmere garment producers who are wholly innocent parties in this dispute and who stand to lose around GPB 20 million of export orders and possibly 1000 jobs. By these vindictive actions, the United States has prejudiced, not only their own reputation, but also the future of the transatlantic partnership. Precisely what the USA asked for – an arbitration panel under Article 21(5) – I believe in the letter to Sir Leon of 13 July is now under way. We must condemn the crude attempt at intimidation by the United States, singling out for exemption from sanctions products from Denmark and the Netherlands because these countries voted against the banana regime in Council. On this point, I wish to ask the Commission what mechanism is at the disposal of the US authorities that would allow them to distinguish between products originating in say Denmark or Holland as opposed to those from France or the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The points we make in the resolution of the Committee on External Economic Relations are very clear. We demand that the European Union fulfill its obligations to our ACP trade partners and we expect the Commission to achieve that objective within the WTO framework. Finally, we cannot and will not tolerate further damage to our industries by a regime whose ambition is matched only by its arrogance.</p>

But to react to that by immediately declaring war, by imposing a 100 % duty on candles, weapons, pullovers and suchlike, is not, in my view, the right answer. It is the old method of trying to get your way by might and main that was used in the wars of the past. The winner is the one who can shoot most people dead.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned a lot more since then in Europe. Basically it is a question of finding a better solution. That means if we have two different points of view, we should acknowledge that both sides could be right. Then we should try to meet each other halfway and say, let us not just accept solution 1 or 2, let us also try solution 3, 4, 5, 10 or 15 and go on until we find a solution that everyone can accept; and these solutions must be worked out at a high official level.</p>

<p class="contents">Although the European Union has taken account of the WTO verdict by amending its regulations, the United States is again threatening trade sanctions against imported European products. The United States also wants the EU to lift its embargo on imports of hormonised meat and is preparing an offensive against genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 January, the US ambassador to the European Union stressed that the banana dispute was a minor issue compared to the potential scope of the hormonised meat and GMO issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This reaffirmation of the commercial and political domination of the United States and the latter"s desire to start the next round of negotiations from a position of strength are basically calling into question the WTO mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution tabled jointly by my group and the Green Group condemns the threats of American sanctions. It urges the Commission to stand firm in the face of this new offensive so that we can continue to protect the interests of Community and ACP producers.</p>
<p class="contents">While awaiting the next arbitration proceedings of the WTO panel, an interim agreement has been obtained. However, the United States has not abandoned its threats. If the sanctions announced are applied unilaterally, is the Commission ready to reply by applying equivalent retaliatory measures if necessary?</p>

Tonight, we are showing our support for the Commission, as the Commissioner himself pointed out. There is therefore no point in repeating arguments that have already been put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few comments, although I do not know if I shall receive any response to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to look at the problems that this crisis entails. The initial problem is that although, during the final round in Marrakesh on the World Trade Organisation constitution, we insisted that the dispute settlement procedure be included, what we wanted was to combat American unilateralism. Now, however, Section 301 of US external trade law is coming back to haunt us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it seems as though the Americans may be exempt from the dispute settlement procedure as it has not been possible to contest either the Helms‐Burton Act or the D"Amato Act effectively within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what we are concerned about – particularly the members of Parliament"s Committee on Legal Affairs – is whether or not the Commission really has sufficient resources to face up to the huge team of legal experts the United States has assembled in Geneva. It seems as though the United States is capable of winning almost all the cases we are bringing: we have just mentioned the issue of hormones, we have a possible appeal on genetically modified organisms and we also have the banana war.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, if we do not soon reach an agreement on this issue and if the United States insists on multilateral measures, the Community may have to reconsider to what extent it is prepared to submit to a multilateral mechanism, which the United States itself does not seem to want to respect.</p>

<p class="contents">As we pointed out at the time, the scale of the retaliatory measures announced seems to be disproportionate, regardless of the rights and wrongs on each side. On our side, this dispute threatens assistance for two peripheral regions – Mr Mendonça will doubtless mention Madeira – and for poor ACP countries which have no satisfactory alternative to banana production. As for the Americans, this dispute does not threaten the interests of their own farmers, just those of extremely powerful multinationals which operate in Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While we obviously must be sensitive towards the populations of these countries, it must be stressed that the market available both outside and within Europe is still very extensive, regardless of the established quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support one of the oral questions put to the Commission about whether or not an understanding can be achieved within the WTO panel. As we inevitably have major reservations about the fairness of the American position, we would also ask – and this is also a policy suggestion – whether the Commission is ready to rigorously and rapidly apply the trade policy instruments at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must lend our full political support to the Commission"s continued firm position on this dispute, as clearly indicated in Paragraph 3 of the motion for a resolution which follows on from the oral questions tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">By taking this step, we are not simply trying to legitimately defend the interests of the people and areas affected, which in this specific case are the banana‐producing areas on one hand and the areas which would be hit by American retaliatory measures on the other. Much more importantly, we are ultimately helping to ensure the multilateral resolution of disputes, in accordance with WTO rules, and consequently the rejection of unilateral retaliatory measures which use a political logic which we would rather not qualify.</p>

Instead, the USA is continuing its offensive with the aim of destroying any Community banana support regime and wiping out the remaining production in less‐developed and ultraperipheral regions, as is happening in Madeira.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most scandalous aspect of this offensive is its unilateral nature, with total disregard for WTO structures. The USA is now threatening to impose new customs duties on European products exported to the United States. In practice, this would mean a ban on various products entering the American market, including textile products.</p>
<p class="contents">This offensive also includes new attacks to force the European Union to accept imports of American hormonised meat and genetically modified products, with total disregard for the health of European consumers. Commissioner, this offensive must be stopped in its tracks. If the USA carries out its threat, it is essential that the EU should be able to retaliate immediately by clearly restricting the access of American products to the European market. It is also essential, and fundamental, that the Commission should use all available mechanisms under international trade law to reestablish the legality which the USA is trying to undermine.</p>

<p class="contents">I must take this opportunity to point out that the European banana‐producing regions include some of the ultraperipheral island regions which are still suffering from a lack of economic development. In these regions, banana production is the main and sometimes only source of income for thousands of families. We cannot begin to imagine the economic, social and environmental damage which would have occurred in the autonomous region of Madeira if the European institutions had yielded to the pressures which American‐controlled multinationals determined to defend their own interests are continuing to exert on the banana market.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances it is clear that, in order to protect itself, the European Union must not submit in any way to the pressure exerted by the USA with regard to matters which may still be under discussion. The European institutions should, within the various international bodies, maintain their steadfast opposition to unilateral retaliatory trade measures. In this respect, the sanctions announced by the USA are scandalous and are already starting to have negative effects on other sectors which have nothing to do with the infamous banana dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">We totally support the Commission"s position as long as this remains resolutely in accordance with the spirit of the principles and rules of the World Trade Organisation. However, the Commission must be prepared, as it seems to be, to respond rigorously and rapidly if unilateral measures are applied by the United States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, may I first of all say that those who have spoken in the latter part of the debate have pointed out that the action taken by the United States is not only action taken against parts of the Caribbean countries, but also against parts of the European Union which are very dependent on bananas. In the case of some of the Caribbean countries, if they gave up producing bananas they would be likely to be driven to being drug havens which would do more damage to the United States than it would do to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Smith asked how can the United States discriminate against products completely unrelated to bananas such as cashmere, and in the case of Italy pecorino, and other products of other countries? Our view is that they have no right to do so whatsoever and that this is simply a bullying tactic designed to persuade the European Union to succumb to American threats.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Article 301, which was also a point that has been raised, our view has always been that it is unlawful. Up to now we have been content to let it stay on the American statute book and only to take action if it is actually implemented. If it is implemented, the action will certainly be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">We were asked by Mr Medina Ortega whether we are able to face up to the American lawyers in these various threats? The answer is certainly Yes. We have done so as he has pointed out in the case of the Helms‐Burton and D'Amato Acts and we will do so in the face of all other legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">What will we do if action is taken? First of all we will respond in the WTO by taking a case against the Americans, as we have begun to do. Secondly, if we win that case, we will be entitled to retaliate lawfully against the United States but, in addition to that, we will have to give serious consideration to taking action which would be in accordance with the WTO but would involve the withdrawal of concessions which are not bound in the WTO and which the United States do not have as of right. I hope it does not come to that but the European Union is ready to defend its interests against anybody, including the United States.</p>
