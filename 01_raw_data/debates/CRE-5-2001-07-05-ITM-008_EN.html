The recognition of the rights of children is of vital importance. I am glad to be able to say that 25 years ago I published an article which, at least from a certain point of view, helped in pushing forward that case. I do not want to talk about the whole motion for a resolution today, however. I want to talk about one particular problem which is dealt with in the amendment by my group.</p>
<p class="contents">I am old enough to have children over the age of 25. I see visitors in our gallery who are about the age of 25. Like many people I can just imagine what it would be like to have a child ripped from your hands at the age of 20 days and never to see them again, be yourself in prison for five years under torture and cruel treatment, and then spend the rest of your life at liberty trying to find your lost child.</p>
<p class="contents">Sara Méndez from Uruguay was in this Parliament yesterday to press forward the case for recovering her child, or getting information about her son Símon, who was ripped from her arms aged 20 days after her illegal capture in Buenos Aires in 1976. That is a dreadful thing to happen and we should add to this admirable motion for a resolution a clause calling upon those who are in authority in Uruguay to recognise the evil of disappearances, to recognise their bounden duty to bring children back to their parents and to end this scandal and disgrace. I hope we will carry the motion for a resolution and make that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In September 2001, on the eve of the summit, our group is naturally tabling a resolution in witness of our commitment, as we have always done.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember a time when it was difficult to mention the word children in this House. The Dutroux affair had to happen before budget lines could be freed up and a certain number of resolutions passed for our children. We have therefore had some successes. The latest is the reference to children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and some of us in this House, notably under the leadership of Mary Banotti, have won a few battles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to restate our commitment and determination on the eve of this summit, and we must also dedicate ourselves even more firmly to the cause of children, not just in Europe, but throughout the world, because there are now 600 million children worldwide in families living on less than a dollar a day, facing the real evils of malnutrition, lack of education and lack of health provision. We must mobilise against those evils.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, our resolution proposes providing an institutional context to serve children. First, the various decisions we take should be subject to assessment of their impact on policy on children and family policy, secondly, the Commission should have a unit to deal with children’s issues and, thirdly, a special envoy should coordinate policies on children.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, we think it is important to be in a position to establish a European solidarity fund for the world’s children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our censure of such behaviour is clearly voiced in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also, however, going to table some amendments, for which I would request the House’s support, since it seems the resolution contains a loophole: there is no mention of the family and in any discussion of children, we must also consider the family. When it comes to these resolutions, we always tend to be concerned about the most terrible situations of suffering and neglect, as I said earlier, involving children used in armed conflict, etc. Generally, however, children live within a family environment and a policy for children must inevitably also be a policy for the family, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. As I am fond of saying, a world fit for children must also be a world fit for the family. I should also like to say that I was moved by Mr MacCormick’s words and that we shall be supporting his amendment. Yesterday, at the compromise meeting, doubts were expressed as to whether or not we should include a specific case, but his words convinced me. They convinced me perhaps because in Portugal too, the issue of children disappearing and of the terrible suffering endured by the families – and some cases in Portugal have been dragging on for years – is also an issue which is of constant concern to us, given the impotence of the State and of police forces. These cases involve terrible, heartrending pain, which is also worthy of comment by this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is sometimes good in a wide-ranging resolution and in a broad framework to zoom in for a moment on something very concrete.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone who over 24 years after the event is still searching for her son Simon. The military in her country took life in absolute freedom away from her, but they themselves still enjoy that freedom. I believe that it is right – and I appreciate the fact that our President, Mrs Fontaine, also lent her support – that we should support her, because it makes something clear about who these people are. Because if we eventually see the day when in the pandemonium of lawlessness the international rule of law prevails, it will be because of such brave individuals who have persevered for so long. That is why I hope that we, standing above the parties and quite apart from arguments with each other, will shortly support the amendments made on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point on the optional protocol. I should like to ask the Commissioner something about this. So 29 countries have signed up to it. That includes all fifteen European Member States. The protocol provides for children in armed conflicts to be as it were kept out of the sphere of child exploitation and child soldiery. Only four countries have ratified it. At least ten are required for it to come into force. So there is a great need on our part to say: exert pressure in the Council too, on the various organisations in Europe and on the countries to get them to sign, so that we can achieve a success.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to say that I differ on one point from the honourable Members of the People’s Party. Not on the content of their amendments on the family. I very much appreciate them. There is no disagreement between us on that. However, in the context of the rights of the child we felt that the treatment of the subject deserves separate attention and as such does not belong here. We shall not vote against. We shall abstain, because we have no substantive objections to the texts you have submitted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to the determining of a common EU position on the occasion of the extraordinary session on children’s rights at the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be generally appreciated if the Belgian Presidency were to succeed in getting the European Union to speak with one voice. It can build on the efforts already made by the Swedish Presidency to decide on a common strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as content is concerned there should be especial emphasis on the fact that as regards free access to education for all children and guaranteed health care provision, binding agreements should be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should pay extra attention to the situation of children in the candidate-Member States, specifically Bulgaria and Romania. For that matter it could be decisive if the European Parliament were to take the initiative of inserting the dimension of the rights of the child into the rights of human beings in general. In addition I should like to urge the EU in bilateral exchanges between European Member States and third countries to focus attention systematically on the situation of children in the third countries. This approach will undoubtedly bear fruit if pursued consistently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They make carpets in Nepal and luxury shoes in Thailand, they work in the coffee and cocoa plantations in Africa, and all for export, for us to enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe it takes more underhand forms: apprenticeships give rise to abuses of working time. Child models are used. We have child sports stars to entertain us as we watch television. On top of that are the things no one can tolerate: sexual abuse which destroys whole lives, pornography and prostitution. I think our position should therefore be implacable. Forcing children to work restricts their intellectual, physical and psychological development, so I do not think it is any good continuing to have countries signing conventions to get rid of labels, knowing they are doing it as if they were buying a pair of shoes.</p>
<p class="contents">The minimum to be demanded at the Conference in September is every child’s right to education, every child’s right to leisure, and every child’s right to be informed of his or her rights. We must secure that, at least. If we do not do so, it will effectively mean that children’s rights are like a pair of shoes. When they are dirty and full of holes, they end up in the bin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate them warmly. We have great expectations of this presidency and we will be keeping a very steady eye on what is happening and on progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also agree with Mrs Hermange who rightly pointed out that, up to very recently, children could not even be mentioned in this House. We were constantly told they were not part of the competence of the Treaties and our concerns for their welfare were beyond the reach of this Parliament. Happily now we can discuss them. As long as I have been here in Parliament we have observed the awful dangers that many children in the world live in: a litany of miseries which are listed in this resolution here today. Not too far from here children are still viewed as disposable objects for international adoption, for example. We should hang our heads in shame that we have more legislation on the books of the European Union relating to animal welfare than we have relating to the welfare of children. And lest anyone should attack me on that, I would like to say that I support animal welfare legislation as well. But the situation is shameful.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a political push forward. You will see in this resolution that we call, for example, for a dedicated unit in the Commission looking at children's rights, looking at legislation so that we can assess its impact on the children and also on the lives of their families. It is with great pleasure that I commend this resolution to the House. I am happy to be one of the sponsors of Sara Méndez and her lost child. Through my work in Parliament I too have experienced the fact that so many children are deprived of the company and love of both their parents, very often due to selfishness and lack of understanding about the particular needs of children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the special session of the United Nations in New York in September must be not just to get this convention ratified but to ensure that all the countries then apply it. One fundamental element is the fight against child labour. All too often children are seen as an investment to secure the survival of the family. The parents who, like their children, never received an education, are by definition the people who are living in poverty and debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Children who are exposed from an early age to the harshest physical demands lose not just their innocence and identity, they often lose their whole childhood. I have seen children who will not survive beyond the age of 14. According to estimates by UNICEF, 200 000 children a year are sold in order to work on plantations in west and central Africa. Two million children in the world, mainly girls, are being exploited by pimps. There is cause for hope, however. I have seen positive examples on the ground in India and Nepal. The Rugmark Foundation is helping children whose parents work in carpet factories to obtain educational qualifications. This NGO was founded jointly by German development aid organisations and carpet manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">These rugs rightly carry a quality label stating that they have not been manufactured by children. In the meantime, 10% of Indian exporters have successfully applied for a Rugmark licence. It is a first step in the right direction. It will only be successful in the long run, however, if consumers change their attitude and demand these products.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example which gives cause for hope comes from Brazil. A pupil's wage has been introduced for 11 million children from the poorest families. This special programme has been set up for ten years and children are being paid a total of EUR 850 million a year to go to school. Examples such as the few which I have been able to cite should set a precedent throughout the world, for the sake of the children.</p>

<p class="contents">It is an important debate as part of the preparatory process for the UN Special Session on Children. The Commission, in coordination with Member States, firmly supports a rights-based approach founded on the Convention of the Rights of the Child. Since 1992, for almost one decade now, all cooperation agreements between the European Union and third countries have incorporated a clause defining human rights as an essential element of the agreement. This includes the rights of the child and respect for the core labour standards as set out in the eight ILO fundamental conventions. The Commission strongly supports efforts by the international community to eliminate child labour across the world. In this regard, the Commission particularly supports the work of the ILO which adopted a convention in 1999 banning the worst forms of child labour, some of which were referred to during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On 15 September 2000, the Commission underlined its support for the ILO's efforts against child labour by adopting a recommendation to the Member States to ratify this new convention. While there is no specific Community competence in children's matters, the European Commission recognises children as a particularly vulnerable group within the overarching policy focus on poverty and vulnerability, and the concerns about children as well as about human rights and gender issues are an integral part of our development policy objective of poverty eradication, especially in social sectors such as education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas there is no explicit focus on children in development cooperation, ECHO has made children a priority for our humanitarian assistance this year. Promotion of the rights of the child is also a high priority for funding under the European initiative for democracy and human rights where the promotion of the rights of the child was chosen as a priority theme for funding under the budget this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As a complement to the European Union's intervention in international fora such as the UN, the Commission offers substantial support to projects designed to address the plight of children affected by conflict, and there were several references to that problem. Since the beginning of 2000, more than EUR 40 million have been spent on projects providing assistance and protection to children affected by armed conflict. The Commission is therefore active in supporting children's rights both at the political level and through practical initiatives. I am grateful for your indulgence, President, but this seemed to me to be a sufficiently important subject on which to make those remarks.</p>

<p class="contents">There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam. The resolution before us emphasises this serious state of affairs, supporting freedom of religion for religious societies of Buddhists, Roman Catholics and Protestants not recognised by the Vietnamese government. Societies of these three denominations that <span class="italic">are </span>recognised by the state are reminiscent of the traditional Communist pattern: they are monitored by the Vietnamese authorities. A second proof that Vietnamese citizens have no freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">This unconstitutional situation issues directly from the nature of the country’s political constellation. Obviously the Communist rulers of Vietnam are as terrified as ever of any free association and opinion. That applies even more if this takes place on the basis of definite religious views. Even today the Vietnamese government indoctrinates its citizens with pure antireligious ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this general, restrictive social context the Protestants of the Central Highlands in the south of Vietnam occupy a special place. They are exposed to double social discrimination, or worse still, persecution. As members of various ethnic minorities they are literally the doormats of the ‘kinh’, the so-called true Vietnamese, who consider themselves superior.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition for the past 15 years a Vietnamese government-encouraged mass exodus of ‘kinh’ into the fertile lands of the Central Highlands migration has simply amounted and amounts to common or garden theft of land. Those ‘Non-kinh’ and ‘backward’ Christians must simply accept this violation of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Vietnam wants to be a player in the international field. See its participation in the ASEM process. It is therefore perfectly reasonable for the Council and the Commission should take Hanoi seriously to task about the desperate lack of freedom of religion in its own country. I therefore emphatically call on them to do so. It is not good enough to embed freedom of religion in the constitution and to practise the opposite. Surely the era of Stalin and his like must at last be over.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But here, for example, sits Mr Mayer, who represents Lower Bavaria, one of the most upwardly mobile regions at the heart of Europe. One might even say that Lower Bavaria borders on Vietnam, because if you go from Lower Bavaria across the Czech border to Bohemia, you will see huge Vietnamese markets, with all that this implies in the border area. This shows how many waves of refugees have left Vietnam for central Europe and Europe as a whole over the last thirty years and it shows how small the world has become and how closely everything hangs together.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last plenary session, Mr Modrow of the Social Democrat Party spoke about the huge crimes committed in Asia in the twentieth century by Germany, the USA and Japan. He apparently completely forgot, however, that the worst crimes in Asia in the twentieth century were committed by Communists, namely the Khmer Rouge, namely Stalin and Lenin in the east of the Soviet Union, in China and, last but not least, in Vietnam, where people were persecuted for decades after the horrific Vietnam War and still are persecuted. Vietnam is a Communist country in which religious freedom continues to be trampled underfoot.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of contacts with Vietnam and we are in favour of economic contact with south-east Asia. We take the view, however, that the only basis for economic collaboration is the rule of law and democracy. Neither the rule of law nor democracy exist in Vietnam. We must give massive support to the process of reform in Vietnam, which is still in its infancy, by saying quite categorically that freedom of religion and conscience, freedom for the Buddhists, Catholics and Protestants who are brutally persecuted and imprisoned there, is our yardstick for collaboration with this country. Only when religious freedom is granted and only when these standards are applied can Vietnam become a partner for us.</p>

It would be good if communism could co-exist with religious beliefs, and people should have the right to express their religious beliefs if they live in a communist country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that in Vietnam that is not the situation. In the resolution, reference is made to two very old Buddhist monks who spent two decades in detention under house arrest for their peaceful support for human rights, democracy and religious freedom. This is completely unacceptable. The problem in Vietnam is also that domestic human rights monitoring is not allowed, and that independent human rights monitors continue to be prevented from visiting the country. We have to put pressure on Vietnam to release all prisoners who are being imprisoned or detained for peacefully expressing their religious and political beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also ask the Vietnamese to stop harassment of prisoners and surveillance of prisoners who have actually been released. Furthermore, they need to look at their criminal code sections on crimes against national security to ensure that these laws cannot be applied against those merely exercising their right to freedom of expression, as well as at the administrative detention directive which allows for the detaining of individuals for up to two years. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things I am disappointed with is that there was no reference to the recent decision of the Vietnam National Assembly backing the concept of a dam in the northern province, which might become Southeast Asia's largest hydro-power project, possibly involving the relocation of more than 100 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that they would take into consideration the international aspects of this in relation to the immense social and environmental problems that will be caused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As some of you may know, I went on a short trip to Vietnam recently. I accompanied the Most Venerable Quang Do, the number two in the Unified Buddhist Church, in order to enter Vietnam and take the patriarch back to Saigon, where he could, at last, receive the necessary medical care.</p>
<p class="contents">The patriarch was imprisoned for 20 years. He was freed in 1997 and, despite being set free, he is still under ‘administrative’ detention and it is still impossible for him to travel freely and freely practice his religion. Our mission was cut short because today, in the churches, in the Vietnamese pagodas, there are more police officers than monks. During the day I spent in the pagoda, I myself saw two monks, I managed to see two monks and I saw at least ten police officers and then, when everything happened, I saw more police officers who were obviously plain clothes men appear from the road.</p>
<p class="contents">I say all this to describe the situation in Vietnam, a situation which is not confined to Saigon. In dozens of other pagodas in the country, monks took to the road to accompany the Most Venerable Quang Do but were stopped, very often by louts who beat them up; in other cases, it was police officers who used force to take them back to their pagodas.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reality of Vietnam today; it is the reality, once again, of a regime which describes itself as reforming but where there are no reforms to be seen, and I believe that, in this respect, this resolution is important. It is also important because it calls on our delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, South-east Asia and the Republic of Korea to go to Vietnam and make a clear assessment of the situation in the area of religious freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on all our fellow Members to urge the Chair of the Delegation, Mr Nassauer, to make this trip in the next few days, in the coming weeks and not in the coming months. This is urgent – the lives, freedom, at least a minimum of freedom for these people are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask the Commission and the Council to make representations to the Vietnamese authorities and remind them that there are examples of former communist countries, such as Poland and Hungary, where the communist classes understood the need to change. They still exist as political forces today. In other countries, these communist classes did not understand and were swept aside. This is an important message which we must send to the Vietnamese authorities without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, with even greater importance given the extremely serious crisis in which neighbouring Zimbabwe has become entangled. The Republic of South Africa proves that there is a way forward for Africa, that there is an alternative to poverty, to underdevelopment, to war, despotism, corruption and poor governance. We are, nevertheless, familiar with the problems affecting the Republic of South Africa, such as the extremely high incidence of AIDS, the very high level of unemployment, the poverty and the serious social inequalities, economic stagnation and the terrifying level of violent crime. I must reiterate the genuinely tragic effects of violent crime suffered by the South African people, particularly women, as well as the communities of immigrants from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Republic of South Africa will not be able to overcome the enormous challenges it faces without the support and the solidarity of the international community. We are pleased to note that the European Union is playing an important role in this area, to the extent that is provides, together with its Member States, 70% of international aid. The European Union’s cooperation with the Republic of South Africa has a projected budget for the period until 2006 of around PTE 180 billion, that is around EUR 9.02 billion, to which we can add an equal amount of funding from the EIB, the main aims being to combat poverty, to encourage economic and social development, to create jobs, to stimulate the private sector and to consolidate democracy and the rule of law. It is nevertheless crucial that under this cooperation, new actions are planned and that measures already in place that have a direct impact in terms of fighting crime are improved, such as measures for providing the police with organisational and institutional support and support for the modernisation and improvement of the judicial system. We hope that this ambitious cooperation programme, which must be implemented down to the very last euro, will prove decisive in helping the Republic of South Africa to overcome the serious problems it faces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all remember the exemplary way in which President Nelson Mandela led the process, and his choice was not accidental. South Africa’s transition was acknowledged by the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the two presidents: the last president of the apartheid era and President Nelson Mandela, that great African statesman. Recently, however, we have seen an increasingly critical situation, particularly with regard to crime. This is a very serious issue, which is of great concern to the Portuguese citizens resident in that country. In the last four years, 400 Portuguese citizens have been murdered, and this year alone, 14 Portuguese and therefore European citizens have been killed, which is causing turmoil in the Portuguese community in South Africa and in Portugal. The turmoil generated by these events often obstructs the matter from being debated calmly. The intervention of the European Union can, therefore, be extremely useful in helping South Africa to address this problem, because the social and economic crisis underlying crime, as well as the increase in crime are issues that are crucial to consolidating South Africa’s progress on a path that has already impressed us. The alternative, which would be very sad, would ruin an experiment that we all hope will succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know what this country has been through. It has emerged from years of social segregation and apartheid which have left permanent marks. Today, the crime and problems in this country are related, above all, to the years of social deprivation and segregation it suffered.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet today this country is preparing to host the World Conference Against Racism. Today, Nelson Mandela is fighting anti-white racism. Today, despite everything, this country has just won a decisive victory over the pharmaceutical industry which had decided not to provide it with any medicines: in any case, the South African people does not have access to tritherapy or AZT, medicines now capable of saving its population.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is my turn to repeat myself and to say that I will keep repeating this here: abolish the third world debt, enable men and women to live in dignity at last and assign this money to education and health, which are at the very basis of this country’s resurgence – this is what is important. We have to stop beating about the bush and, at last, raise the real issues after years of apartheid. Today, we have to fight social segregation, and the only way to do that is through the cancellation of the debts of third world countries and those of, among others, South Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tremendous impoverishment of large sections of the population, which goes hand in glove with the massive spread of AIDS and with drug-dealing and racketeering, are real causes for concern. Do we not realise that poverty and the need for survival are a crisis waiting to happen in Africa? This is where the crisis prevention is needed that we have spoken of so frequently over recent weeks, this is where we need self-help development programmes for the black population, health protection, support for preventive health care and, most importantly, educational support, before it is too late. All this was discussed at length.</p>
<p class="contents">We also discussed something else, namely no arms exports to countries where poverty may disturb social peace. Unfortunately, the Council has not honoured the promise made in the European Parliament. Sweden, together with Germany, Great Britain and Italy, supplies arms to the value of 43 billion in local currency. All the intentions expressed here, namely conflict prevention programmes without arms exports, have been forgotten by the Swedish government.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not all. The whole thing was set up by bribing the South African government. That shows that our code of conduct for arms exports is still full of holes and that we still cannot use it as an instrument for real conflict prevention. We need to work on this. We need clear criteria and transparent mechanisms so that this cannot happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We reiterate our support for the government of South Africa but, at the same time, we ask it to make greater efforts in a number of areas, such as improving the living standards of the black population, reducing inequalities, creating employment, respecting minorities, fighting crime, and preventing and treating AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">By putting pressure on the South African authorities in this way, we are on the one hand covering up the responsibility which many of our countries and the so-called ‘western world’ should be assuming for the colossal injustice that the South Africans had to start from in the democratic reconstruction of their society.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it seems that we are giving the message that those who are in power there are not doing everything they can to put an end to the problems we are pointing out, and that conclusion would be another injustice on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the priorities of the Pretoria government, and trying to overcome these problems is what makes that country an acceptable model for the whole of southern Africa. I believe it is vital to emphasise that we understand the effort that South Africa is making, often in a courageous and innovative manner, with significant victories such as the one it has just gained in the matter of AIDS, for instance, against the great pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, I should like to remind you that I was the rapporteur last year when we debated the trade, development and cooperation agreement with South Africa, and I do not remember from this debate that the European Union was over-generous with our contribution to increasing the South African government’s ability to overcome all these major challenges. Now we are the ones who are demanding that they should be more effective. Of course, we must remain vigilant, but without forgetting the serious difficulties that South Africa is facing, and of course we must turn our concerns into supportive cooperation to give the South Africans a better chance to achieve their objectives, which, moreover, coincide with our own demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In an ocean of instability, however, of never-ending wars and conflicts, such as in the long-suffering Angola, one regional power could guarantee a degree of order and peace in southern Africa – the Republic of South Africa. A real political miracle has taken place there, which is firmly ingrained in our minds: the country moved from apartheid to democracy. South Africa made a peaceful choice for democracy and thereby put an end to decades of racial oppression. Nevertheless, South Africa still faces serious problems that have been described here today, from violent crime, into which the country is threatening to sink, and into which it could very well sink, to the terrible disease of AIDS. The changes in South Africa have given rise to great hope, however. The wisdom and the prestige of Nelson Mandela gave South Africa enormous authority in the world. His political successors now have great responsibilities to history and to the heritage of values bequeathed to them by Nelson Mandela. South Africa can only be a power that has a positive influence on the destinies of its region and of the world if it avoids sliding into racial or ethnic conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The immigrant communities are living in fear and anxiety. The Portuguese community, one of the largest and most affected by the violence, has already been brave enough to demonstrate on the streets and demand protective measures. We must support South Africa, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and help it, without adopting a paternalistic attitude, to develop and to combat a lack of safety, conflict, violent death and murder. A drift towards violence would be a tragedy not only for South Africa but also for Europe and for the whole world. Amongst the many resolutions adopted by this Parliament, this is one of the most important and topical. The Portuguese and other European citizens living in South Africa will then feel that Europe is not abandoning them to their fate and will keep the flame of hope alight. Most effective in achieving the remainder of what needs to be done, however, will be the diplomacy of the Commission and the Member States. I would remind you of the words of the great French philosopher, Montaigne, who said: ‘Every man contains within him the entire form of the human condition’. To a certain extent, it is the human condition that is at stake in that great country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In just over two months’ time presidential elections will be taking place in his country, White Russia. Not without reason the power-hungry White Russian head of state is rather concerned about the outcome. For example, will the opposition succeed in uniting behind one candidate? Will it, moreover, be able to develop a strategy for cooperation with the growing number of critics in the Lukashenko camp?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition the neutral attitude of his Russian counterpart Putin must be uncomfortable. What is more, recent opinion polls cannot be reassuring either. Finally, the grave accusations of two senior magistrates of the White Russian Public Prosecutor’s Office, place the president himself, together with the country’s present Attorney General, in a very unflattering light: it is alleged that on their orders specially formed death squads liquidated no less than 30 citizens in the period 1998-2000. These include prominent missing persons such as the former White Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Zacharenko, the opposition politician Gontshar and the White Russian television reporter Sawadski.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to secure his reelection above everything else the autocrat in Minsk eschews no means of neutralising his political rivals – ‘depicted’ in the state media as enemies of the people and criminals – in advance. No wonder that over half the population state in opinion polls that they do not expect fair and free presidential elections on 9 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, an understandable attitude. Because President Lukashenko is trying to frustrate all efforts in that direction – specifically a network of local, officially registered observers, actively supported by the OSCE mission in Minsk. In this connection see particularly the presidential decree of 12 March, approved by parliament on 7 June.</p>

<p class="contents">My visits to Belarus on several occasions have left me with a pessimistic, hopeless image. It is an authoritarian, personality-centred regime, in which the opposition has no chance to express itself. The opposition ranges from democratic communists to Christian democrats via social democrats, within a framework of a lack of freedom, as I have said repeatedly.</p>
<p class="contents">The constant violation of human rights is also very worrying.

It is with concern that we must concede that even the four basic conditions which we set for preparations for the presidential elections have not been met. The opposition is still being persecuted and criminalised. It still has no free or fair access to the media, especially state television. Disappearances are still not explained, especially the fate of Mr Kontscha and the Russian cameraman Mr Zawadski, for whom journalists are now holding a commemorative week.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today, I should like to highlight the case of Professor Bandaschewski, who has tried for years to enlighten the people in the areas contaminated by Chernobyl. Because he told the truth and because he opposed people moving back into these areas, he has now ended up in prison serving an eight-year sentence. Can you imagine? It is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus still represents a challenge for European diplomacy. We must be critical where criticism is needed but we must also provide support where we can.

We are talking about the future of the whole of Eastern Europe. The Pope was recently in Ukraine and voices were raised both for and against him. Not between denominations, however, as everyone would have us believe, because pro-Europeans of all denominations welcomed his visit. It was the anti-Europeans who criticised him. The Russian patriarch Alexei travelled to Belarus, not to criticise the repression of human rights and religious freedom there, but to campaign – with the support of the state – for the restoration of the single state of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This shows that we are talking about an important political force here, which is why it is important to support the freedom of the people of Belarus and ensure that democracy and the rule of law are established there. Now that Milosevic has been toppled, the last real Communist dictatorship in Europe is the regime in Belarus. It is most important to ensure, and here my support goes above all to Mrs Schroedter, who has done a great deal of work here, that prisoners of conscience are released, that political prisoners are released, that the opposition is at last given a fair chance and that free elections can at last be held in Belarus, so that this country can return to where it has belonged since the beginning of its history, namely in the community of Europeans.</p>

The Tutsis of Nilotic origin are the minority tribe, but they dominate the government and the army. Such tribal polarisation as we often see in Africa has been a major factor in the internal conflict, not only in Burundi but in neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1993 Burundi's Hutu President was assassinated and within a month over 100,000 civilians were killed. A further 150,000 civilians have been killed since then. More than half a million are refugees in Tanzania's refugee camps to this day. The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced similar conflict and almost 2 million civilians have been killed there or are missing over the last two to three years. In the Horn, East and Central Africa covering 12 countries, there are 20 million displaced persons, displaced from their homes and their villages.</p>
<p class="contents">These people were poor before. They are even poorer today. They have no education, no access to health care, no employment and no shelter. They depend totally on the World Food Programme for their food and they fear those who run the refugee camps where they live. It is not surprising, therefore, that these refugee camps are breeding grounds for disease, discontent and disorder. Young men and women are lured by the warlords to join their unruly gangs. These innocent and desperate people, who were ordinary civilians before, probably farmers, are easily persuaded to train and be armed to support the greed and power struggle of the warlords. The Lusaka and Arusha peace accords have failed to end the violence and internal conflict. Repatriation of refugees is not satisfactory as the people are simply afraid to return to villages devastated, overrun and terrorised by the terrorists or the warlords.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we allow these displaced millions, these desperate refugees, to live in their camps as beggars for life. How can we extinguish the fires of conflict and civil war in these developing countries? Containers full of medicines, tents, food, blankets and other such things bring temporary relief, but this is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be more active and rethink our strategy. We must first of all give the poor a stake in their rural economies so that they may own their own land and have an opportunity to build their lives. Secondly, we must give them the appropriate technology – third world technology – which they can then use to start local enterprises to break this cycle of dependency on us. We must rethink our strategy and reassess the quality of people that we have in place as our ambassadors and representatives, their experience, and see how we can perhaps use local experts with international reputation and competence to advise us, to act on our behalf, to use the limited resources that we have to its best effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">We must embark on this with great urgency. I have great confidence in Commissioner Patten to lead this, and Commissioner Nielson, and I hope that they will get together and make sure that the EU's next decade is much better than the last 40 years, a period in which, I consider, much time and resources were wasted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. </span>– Firstly, on Vietnam, may I say that I share the concerns of honourable Members about the human rights situation and, in particular, about recent developments in that country. These appear to suggest that the progress which has been achieved by the Vietnamese government, both politically and economically, since the 1992 Constitution was adopted may be slowing down or even going into reverse, particularly where political freedoms are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's policy toward Vietnam, as it is towards all countries, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation and to raise concerns both publicly and in private where abuses or a deterioration in the situation is observed. In Vietnam, permitting freedom of opinion and freedom of religion are of paramount importance to the European Union. The Constitution of Vietnam guarantees freedom of belief and religion, and in recent years the state has developed more cooperative arrangements with the Catholic Church. However, the Constitution also specifies that it is forbidden to violate freedom of belief or religion or to take advantage of it to act against the laws or the policies of the state. This provision obviously reflects the desire of the Vietnamese authorities to try to control the pace of change and to maintain their grip on society during the transition process. It is also plainly a restriction on freedom of opinion, and the press law is similarly restricted. The cases mentioned in today's debate seem to me to be more concerned with freedom of opinion than with freedom of religion, a freedom which of course the European Union holds to be equally important. Father Ly has called publicly for the United States not to ratify its bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, linking this action to human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar calls have reportedly been made by members of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. These calls are clearly contrary to the government's policy and difficult for them to tolerate in a society unaccustomed to public dissent. What is needed in Vietnam is continued progress in the country's reform programme so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and to appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government. We will continue to support progress and to take every opportunity to draw attention to the fundamental importance of freedom of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The first article of the EC-Vietnam Cooperation Agreement which we signed with the government of Vietnam in 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for our cooperation. We will shortly be holding in Hanoi a meeting of the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission at which all aspects of our relations will be reviewed including our shared commitment to respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission delegation participates with the Member States represented in Hanoi in all EU démarches to the government of Vietnam on human rights issues, as well as in the regular discussions on human rights which the EU missions pursue with the Vietnamese authorities. I can assure Parliament that in this process, we will continue to raise particular issues of concern and individual cases, and will continue to encourage action to address human rights abuses in Vietnam. I will make those points when I am in Vietnam myself later this month. I would have referred specifically to a point raised by Mr Dupuis, but since he is not here, I will pass on.</p>
<p class="contents">The second subject that I would like to deal with is South Africa. The Commission shares the European Parliament's view that South Africa/EU cooperation should seek to redress the existing inequalities inherited from the apartheid era and to work to improve the living conditions of the population with programmes targeting employment, health, education and housing. That is what our European programme for reconstruction and development is about.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly share the European Parliament's concern that there is an urgent need to combat the HIV/AIDS problem in South Africa and I am sure – as I said this morning during the debate on the forthcoming G8 Summit – that will be one of the subjects which is discussed then in Genoa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees that there is a need for a climate of greater security in South Africa as a prerequisite for a peaceful society and for economic development. We fear that the crime situation is not only a threat to the inhabitants of the country and to its social fabric, but also threatens South Africa's reputation abroad, discourages foreign investment and has a detrimental effect on the economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, the priority areas under our current multiannual indicative programme for the years 2000-2002 are poverty alleviation through the provision of basic social services, private sector support and the consolidation of the rule of law and promotion of human rights. The Commission has funded two programmes to support the South African police force. The most recent one is currently being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that last year saw no new projects or programmes in the health sector, the public health sector support programme 2000, which was agreed in 1999, became operational during the course of the last year. Programmes under consideration for funding in 2001 include a major health programme on primary health care, and that will also cover HIV/AIDS in selected provinces.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for the programming of the next multiannual indicative programme are about to start and they will take place in the course of the next year. In this programming phase the Commission will give very proper consideration to the concerns and interests expressed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to Belarus. I want to say how important it is for Parliament to discuss this subject and I very much take the point raised by a number of honourable Members about the importance of raising our concerns on Belarus with the Russian Federation. That is something we have done, are doing and will continue to do. I welcome this timely debate. I congratulate honourable Members on highlighting the extremely worrying situation in Belarus. The Commission shares the deep concerns contained in the resolutions that are before us today. I join Parliament in calling on President Lukashenka to reverse the present alarming trend towards increased authoritarianism by decisive action to improve human rights, press freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term this means, in particular, ensuring free and fair elections and addressing the situation of missing opposition figures and political prisoners. Improved cooperation with the OSCE will be a vital ingredient in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidential elections on 9 September will be the next test of the democratic credentials of the country and we are in close touch with the OSCE-ODIHR discussions over the desirability of an international election monitoring mission. There are some – I emphasise ‘some’ – encouraging signs of greater unity among opposition parties. However, all the indications are that the authorities will again fail the democratic test, just as the parliamentary elections last October fell disappointingly short of the conditions established by the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a clear position: as long as the present intolerable situation remains we cannot consider closer economic or political relations with Belarus. Unless and until there are significant improvements, our financial assistance will remain limited to direct help to those involved in promoting civil society and democracy, and humanitarian assistance where it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has condemned the recent government decree on external funding for non-governmental organisations, and we are urgently seeking clarification on how it might affect our own assistance programmes. Speaking personally, I would prefer to see our present limited assistance suspended, rather than have it subject to prior approval by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our restrictive policy on political dialogue has not prevented the European Union from repeatedly airing our deep concerns about prominent public figures who mysteriously disappear or who are imprisoned for political reasons. Recently the European Union has raised the cases of the former interior minister Yury Zakharenko, the former head of the election committee, Viktor Gonchav, the businessman Anatoly Krasovsky and the photographer who was referred to in the debate, Dmitry Zavadsky.</p>
<p class="contents">It is disturbing that despite this pressure there has been no progress in these cases. The debate today has highlighted a further case: the imprisonment of Professor Bandashevsky, following his work on the alarming social and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. European Union heads of mission in Belarus have recently undertaken a study into the impact of Chernobyl on public health. The Commission is keen to discuss with Member States how the European Union should respond to these disturbing findings and on how we should react to Professor Bandashevsky's imprisonment, taking account of the strong views that are felt by honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no hesitation at all in defending a fair, but tough, line on Belarus, but it is a pity that it is necessary. Belarus is a country at the heart of Europe that has the potential to become an important political and economic partner for the Union, particularly following enlargement. This is the positive message that we must continue to send to the people of Belarus. In this way we can lend our support to those forces in society that are pressing for the reforms that are so necessary, the reforms that will one day assuredly arrive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I refer to the important speech made by Mr Khanbhai, who raised a number of very important issues, triggered by the position of Burundian refugees in Tanzania. The Commission is concerned about the lack of progress towards peace in Burundi. How could we not be? We are concerned about the continuation of violence against the civil population resulting from persistent clashes between the Burundian army and the rebels. In the current circumstances a voluntary return of Burundian refugees in Tanzanian camps is not, frankly, likely and a forced repatriation is hardly advisable.</p>
<p class="contents">The continued and growing presence of a huge Burundian refugee population in Tanzania is causing tension between the two governments. By the end of May there were approximately 523 000 refugees in camps in Western Tanzania, of whom over 383 000 were Burundians.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Tanzanian government is accused of not preventing Burundian rebels from using refugee camps as bases for their attacks. In reaction to recent allegations by the Burundi government to this effect, Tanzania's President Mkapa suggested an immediate forced repatriation of all refugees, without taking into account the prevailing security situation in Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Tanzania has since reassured the UNHCR that its policy towards the Burundian refugees is not in question, and it undertook to respect its earlier commitment to facilitate a gradual voluntary repatriation once the security conditions in Burundi permit.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, the European Commission will contribute EUR 25 million towards the implementation of the UNHCR plan for voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees to be launched once the situation is favourable. For now, the Commission is taking the necessary measures to assist the government of Tanzania to cope with the refugee population. Through the humanitarian aid office, ECHO, the Commission is funding more than a third of the total humanitarian aid available to refugees in Tanzania. Last year ECHO's budget for aid to Tanzanian refugees was nearly EUR 27 million. This was increased to over EUR 32 million this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai also raised a number of important issues about the management of our assistance and development programmes and about our representation in Africa and in other parts of the world. I look forward to future opportunities to discuss those matters with him and the whole House, not least in the context of the communication which we have just produced on our external services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
