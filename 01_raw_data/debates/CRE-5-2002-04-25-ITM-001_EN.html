That has, at least, the advantage that they have another few weeks, or maybe even longer, to incorporate into their proposals for reform the suggestions for future fleet management in my report, on which we are voting today.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, then, to my report, in which I have consciously limited myself to the Commission's report on the implementation of the multi-annual guidance programmes for reducing fleets. As we are at the crucial stage of preparations for the reform of the common fisheries policy as a whole and thus also of the fleet policy in particular, I would like to express a view on the MAGPs in general, pointing out a number of problems to which consideration must be given at all costs when the reforms are set in train. There are only two – identically-worded – amendments to be voted on today, and I, as rapporteur, can support them without further ado. What this shows is that the Committee on Fisheries is as one in its assessment<span class="italic"> </span>that the Commission's report for 2000, like its predecessors, had shown one thing above all, namely that the MAGPs have not achieved their objective of significantly reducing fleet capacity and thus the fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that the majority of the Member States again failed to reach the target set by their MAGP. We call on these to make substantial efforts to reduce their fleets, at the same time welcoming the way that the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings against several Member States which have repeatedly not kept to their MAGP objectives. We also emphatically call on the Council and the Commission, both at the same time, to analyse the reasons why these targets were not met and develop more effective sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we call on the Commission, when formulating its proposals for a new fleet policy, to deal specifically with the need for a balance between the fishing capacities and/or fishing efforts of each Member State's fleet segment and the catch possibilities available to it. Last week, Commissioner Fischler told the Committee on Fisheries that the European Union's fishing vessels are about 40% over capacity, a figure that is not only alarming but also underlines all the more the urgent need for something to be done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary cause of this over-capacity is that the instrument used to make cuts in the fleet did not achieve its objective and that there has even been a measurable increase in fleet capacity in recent years. There is therefore urgent need for this problem to be dealt with, but, in doing so, it is imperative that the Commission ensure that the fishing fleet is reduced in a socially acceptable manner, by setting up Community financial aid to cushion social hardship. One effective means would be premiums appealing to the fishermen, which the European Union and the Member States together could use to buy up fishing tonnage and either destroy it, sell it, or use it for purposes other than fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The payment of such premiums should be mandatory, and, moreover, the possibility of an increase in the Community's financial contribution should be examined. The previous system led to the situation in which fishermen wanting to leave the business, or having already done so, sell their ship's tonnage on the market, so that even more of the fleet is bought up by efficient companies, yet this does not result in any reduction in capacity. At the end of the day, efforts to reduce fleet capacity must not be to the detriment of on-board working conditions, the vessel's safety, or the quality of the catch. Structural aid must therefore continue to be used to modernise the fleet, but means and ways have to be found to prevent the fishing effort being increased at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that the production of a balanced proposal is no easy task for the Commission, and we are already eagerly awaiting its proposals for reform. I will conclude by thanking all my fellow MEPs who have helped with this difficult task, and, in particular, the Commission for its constructive cooperation.</p>

Furthermore it is a politically very timely report within the context of the reform of the common fisheries policy which is taking place and at a time when there seemed to be proposals which questioned or removed this aid for the renewal or modernisation of the fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, on this work and I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler, please, to take good note of what the European Parliament says today and I hope he will approve the Kindermann report. Mr Fischler, it is wise to put things right. Therefore, I ask you to take note of this, if Parliament takes this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">From Mr Kindermann’s report, as approved in the Committee on Fisheries – improved, I believe, by the amendments we have presented – I would like to highlight the following: firstly, the fleet policy is crucial and has a great impact on fisheries, but also on the regions dependent on fishing and, ultimately, on the economic and social cohesion of Europe. This is a very important aspect which is highlighted in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Fleet policy is an important political instrument, but it is not the only one. There are others to be considered, such as technical measures, the TACs, fishing bans, fishing days, etc. Increasing the capacity of the fleet does not mean fishing more, but fishing better, with more security, with greater habitability and with greater hygiene and health guarantees in terms of the treatment of fish on board. We therefore still need the FIFG aid for the renewal and modernisation of our fleet, which is a crucial aspect if we are still to have fishermen and a competitive fleet. We therefore ask the Commission to adopt measures to increase the capacity and tonnage of renewed vessels. We therefore also ask, within the framework of the reform of the fisheries policy, for the introduction of uniform criteria and objectives to measure the capacity and the segmentation of the fleets of the Member States, as well as the creation of a system for the inclusion and exclusion of vessels in the registers in order to guarantee that capacity does not increase.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we are dealing with a clear and concise report which I hope will reflect the approach of the Committee on Fisheries and this Parliament as a whole to the reform of the common fisheries policy which is getting closer, by opting – in accordance with our wishes – for the maintenance of a renewed, and therefore competitive, fisheries sector and not, Mr Fischler, for its dismantling.</p>

The key points are firstly rebuilding fish stocks and secondly the need to devise ways of measuring fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mr Kindermann's work in this area. He has given us some very good pointers such as reminding us that we are not dealing with one single Community fleet, but with fishing fleets of individual Member States and that each Member State has its own quota for individual fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the data that the report is based on, we should remember that Member States have until the end of 2003 to report new figures and bear in mind that we still do not know how many ships are in the EU fleet. This is worrying and must be rectified. I welcome Mr Kindermann highlighting this.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that Member States should pass on information to the governments and parliaments in the Member States. Fishing is one of the mainstays of rural life in Scotland. I know that my constituents would want to ensure that the Scottish Parliament is kept fully and directly informed of developments at the European Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common guidance programmes for the fisheries fleet are the main problem in the common fisheries policy, since the European fleet is far too large. Last week, Commissioner Fischler stated that the fleet was 40% too big. This means that, at the moment, we are, with the one hand, providing money by way of decommissioning subsidies in an attempt to reduce the size of the fleet and, on the other hand, providing assistance for modernisation. Aid of this kind, together with modernisation, have led in recent years to a situation in which the combined fleet and total fisheries capacity have actually increased. It is a vicious circle which we need to break. In connection with the reform, we should probably therefore consider inaugurating a period in which we do not provide aid for modernising the fleet. I look forward to seeing the Commission’s proposal on precisely this area, based on the principle that there are too few fish for too large a fleet. All the Member States must now comply with the joint resolutions, and we should really also reward those countries which have to date complied with the joint resolutions in the multiannual guidance programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the capacity of the EU fishing fleet is greater than available resources and that therefore firm action is needed to allow many fish stocks to recover to sustainable levels. Reductions in the fleet are thus essential. The overall fishing effort must be controlled as well as fleet size so as to correspond to the resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should better assess the impact of so-called exploited capacity by certain Member States who, at least on paper, claim to have met their MEGP target. The Commission should also ensure stricter enforcement of existing penalties on certain Member States so that the Member States themselves are penalised and not the fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the House will support the amendment which was originally tabled in committee by my group colleague, Mr Nogueira because it is very important. Fisheries in certain areas of the European Union, including Scotland, are a devolved responsibility and it is important that direct communication between ourselves and devolved parliaments should be standard practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To ensure that farmers did not produce too much milk, the number of milking machines was curtailed. One of the Member States appears to be duly adhering to its milk quota but still has too many milking machines after four years. Rapporteur Kindermann then proposes to penalise this Member State and to reduce its milk quota. Another Member State has the correct number of milking machines, but produces much more milk than its quota allows. Mr Kindermann seems not to have any problems with that at all. After all, that country has complied with the multi-annual guidance programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am using this example to demonstrate the absurdity of the situation. The aim of the common fisheries policy is to maintain sustainable fish stocks. For this purpose, total allowed catches and quotas are introduced. The fleet structure is secondary to this. It is a bonus if the capacity is in line with the catch potential, but the capacity is not a goal in itself. In fact, the capacity is distorted by giving subsidies for modernisation and renovation. This smacks more of social policy than of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A social policy is not something we should be ashamed of, but we should call a spade a spade. If we do not, the wrong Member States will find themselves in the dock. Which countries exceed their quotas? Are these not by any chance the countries that receive the highest subsidies for their fleets and duly meet the MAGP objectives? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is straightforward language, which indicates, in fact, the failure of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The multi-annual guidance programme for the fisheries sector was aimed at reducing and renewing the European fishing fleet but, at the same time, we have to note that the programme has not improved the fish stocks in any way. After all, there is no link at all between the Member States’ correct implementation of the programme and an improvement in the situation of the stocks which they fish. I know countries, including the Netherlands, which have not fully met the MAGP objective, but whose fished stocks are nevertheless relatively healthy at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the reality is that, although we may be able to lay down policy in Brussels, each programme, in fact, fails to come up to the mark if the Member States do not adequately monitor the situation. This is also confirmed in the Kindermann report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on the impending Green Paper and the preparations that are being made in this connection. We had expected the Green Paper to have been presented last week or, at least, the Commission to have taken a decision this week. Independently of the Brussels circuit, the BBC, however, announced last night that the presentation of the Commission proposals has been postponed through the intervention of the Spanish Presidency. Politically speaking, it would be unacceptable if this communication by the BBC were true and if a presidency could block or delay the presentation of proposals by the Commission. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a great deal of faith in this Commissioner, and I am also convinced that he will take the Kindermann report seriously, especially paragraph 6 which stipulates that the current MAGP no longer serves the existing fisheries policy in any way and should therefore be dropped from the new fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your analysis of both the strengths and weaknesses of our current fleet policy really is very much to the point, and I also share your opinion that the MAGPs have had their day. This sort of fleet policy no longer enables us to achieve our common objectives for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a more straightforward and more transparent fleet policy, and we also need it to work. Before dealing with the amendments that are being discussed today, I would like to say two things about the current state of fisheries policy and about the preparations for the reform, all the more as these have been mentioned by several speakers today. It goes without saying that we will, as far as possible, deal with the proposals in Mr Kindermann's report when we introduce our reforms, but there is one thing I wish to make clear. That is that I want reform, and the reform proposals are not going to end up being watered down in some way. What is going on at the moment is that additional information and analyses have been asked for from various parties – including within the Commission. As, then, I seek not only proposals for reform, but reform itself in the sense of a resolution in favour of reform, I go along with our taking this extra time to obtain<span class="italic"> </span>these supplementary items of information and put us in a position to defend our position against all comers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like very briefly to address a second issue in view of the various reports that have appeared in the media here. Yesterday, the Commission decided on a quite major rotation of Directors-General and their deputies. One of those affected is the Director-General of the Fisheries Directorate-General, Mr Smidt, who, I would like to make abundantly clear, enjoys my complete confidence; he and I work well together. He too, though, is affected by the rotation, as there are a series of different objectives that are to be translated into reality. This is, by the way, not just about rotation, but also about other objectives. It is in this context that this change should be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now turn, however, to the individual items in the report. In your first and second points, you call on those Member States that have not reached their MAGP objectives to make greater efforts at reducing their fleets. On this I am in complete agreement with you, and the Commission has already commenced infringement proceedings against a number of Member States in connection with this.</p>
<p class="contents">In your third point, you urge the Council and the Commission to impose more effective and deterrent sanctions. I can assure you that we will take this up as part of the overall reform of the common fisheries policy, but I would like to add that, whilst sanctions are meant to have deterrent effect, we also must not lose sight of other principles, such as that of proportionality, according to which the extent of the offence has to be balanced by that of the sanction contemplated.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you on the fourth point as well. The Member States must complete the re-measurement of their fleets as soon as possible. The target date for this is the end of 2003. Against this, I am unable to agree with your statement in item 5. Even if the Member States had met all their targets, sustainable exploitation of the stocks would still not have been achieved. The reason for this is that the Council was far from ambitious enough and set the objectives in its MAGP resolutions far too low. You will be aware from our reports that fleet capacity is in reality showing an increase despite MAGP objectives – even when they are met – rather than falling.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with your sixth and tenth points. The MAGPs should not be continued in their present form when the common fisheries policy is revised. There is a need for improvements to on-board safety. To that I commit myself, but it must not lead to an increase in fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Your seventh point contains a demand for new criteria for measuring fishing effort and fishing capacities, and this we will discuss during the reform process. The number and size of the fishing gears could, for example, be included in measurements of capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept your eighth point as well. A ‘new for old’ arrangement for fishing vessels features in our considerations of the new fleet policy. Your ninth point, too, we accept wholeheartedly. Restrictions on the fishing effort will be a cornerstone of the reforms. I can, finally, accept the demand you make in your eleventh point, namely, that it is necessary to create voluntary scrapping programmes with attractive premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of the Community's contribution is, however, bound by the rules of the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
