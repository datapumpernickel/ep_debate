<p class="contents">As you know, the Presidency convened an Extraordinary Council on 6 May in order to examine this serious issue which, in addition to the obvious and significant repercussions on public health and the economy, is causing understandable concern among our citizens, which are often exacerbated by the way in which this issue is presented in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Before telling you about the results of the Council, allow me to make a preliminary comment. The case of severe acute respiratory syndrome shows once again that communicable diseases, like many other problems which touch on the public health sector, are another example of bio-terrorism which go well beyond the level of the Member States and point to the need for institutional changes that will raise health protection to a basic priority of united Europe. This prospect will make it much easier to coordinate prevention, control and timely intervention to deal with diseases, both in the Community and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you that health still does not hold the position which behoves it at Community level. I am convinced that Europe is the best way to promote ambitious policies in the public health sector in each of our countries, especially with regard to disease prevention and control. In today's Europe, especially after enlargement, health must acquire a stable and strong legal basis which allows for immediate, coordinated, scientific, reliable, efficient intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like now to tell you about the results of the work of the Extraordinary Council. I would remind you that the Council on 6 May was attended for the first time by the Ministers for Health of the acceding countries and by Mrs Brundtland, the General Director of the WHO, so that she could bring us up to date with current developments in atypical pneumonia at worldwide level.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the scientific, epidemiological side of the problem, according to the experts at the international organisations, we know in brief that a coronavirus which was unrecognised until its recent emergence is the cause of the syndrome. The molecular structure of the virus was identified in a very short space of time, if you remember how long it took to identify the AIDS HIV virus. Although it has been identified, we still do not know its exact natural history, just as we still have no special anti-viral medication to treat it and are a long way from finding a vaccine to prevent it.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the method of transmission, there are strong signs that it is transmitted by close contact, most probably via droplets. There is no evidence that goods arriving in the European Union from SARS-infected areas pose a threat to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the epidemiology is concerned, the number of confirmed or suspected cases in the Member States of the European Union remains limited and patients have been effectively isolated and treated, thus so far avoiding further spread of infection and, most importantly, there have been no fatal cases. The Council had a thorough and constructive exchange of views with Mrs Brundtland and noted that the World Health Assembly which is to meet next week will provide an excellent opportunity to review the prevailing situation worldwide and evaluate efforts being made to deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Community measures to deal with the problem are concerned, I would start by recalling that the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States. At Community level, a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases is already operating and is responsible for coordinating measures. The network has provided a very effective basis for the exchange of information, in which the acceding countries have fully participated. The Council endorsed the guidelines agreed on 10 April 2003 by the Network Committee. They are summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">- rapid detection of all suspect cases through good surveillance,</p>
<p class="contents">- protection of those at risk of infection through effective isolation in hospitals, with special emphasis on measures to protect carers,</p>
<p class="contents">- particular attention to be paid to air travel, which appears to have been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably through screening of passengers leaving affected areas, onboard advice to passengers and, finally, through information at airports of entry. These measures must be applied in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as future action is concerned, the Council decided that Community action and efforts being made via the communicable diseases surveillance network and the new programme in the public health sector should continue. Cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and the World Health Organisation also needs to continue in order to contain and eventually stop the spread of this atypical pneumonia.</p>
<p class="contents">This cooperation must aim mainly to assist the affected areas and develop diagnostic tests to promote research on vaccines and their availability in sufficient quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also urged the Member States and the acceding countries to implement fully all the guidelines of the surveillance network, to contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on severe acute respiratory syndrome under the Network Committee and to provide by 15 May all relevant information to the Commission on measures taken to address SARS. Finally, I would point out that we encouraged the Commission to continue coordinating the Member States' action and keep the orientations of the surveillance network under regular review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will review the situation and developments at its meeting on 2 June, at which the Commission will submit a report on measures taken by the Member States. On the basis of this report, the Council will take any further action it deems necessary. Similarly, it supports the Commission's intention to submit an initial draft proposal to create a European Centre for disease prevention and control.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have confined myself to this brief presentation of the work of the Council and am available to answer your questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is important, as the Minister said, are the immediate measures that need to be taken to protect the public. He mentioned some of these immediate measures, but the main point is what the next steps will be to deal with these diseases, which have significant social and economic repercussions, because with current levels of mobility, with millions of people travelling all over the planet, tremendous potential has been given to communicable diseases. SARS is a typical example, with cases occurring from China, where the disease originated, to places a very long way from the original source.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue is that we are seeing sudden epidemics of new diseases. Thirty new infectious diseases or variations on old diseases due to mutating viruses have been reported over the last twenty years. Even old diseases, such as tuberculosis, are reoccurring. There is also talk of an imminent pandemic, an outbreak of influenza. We therefore need constant vigilance and monitoring and to find a coordinated response to health threats.</p>
<p class="contents">The Minister quite rightly stressed that there is the network set up under Decision 2119 in 1998, for the surveillance of communicable diseases but unfortunately, Minister, this network is inadequate for an organised and coordinated response to these health threats. I agree with you that you need to push for a monitoring centre to be set up in accordance with the Commission proposal, like the one in the United States. We need a monitoring centre at European Union level to coordinate the various national centres, because it is of course the Member States' responsibility, but also to coordinate reference laboratories, so that we can have a fast, coordinated response to communicable diseases and even to bio-terrorism, which is what threats with viruses or bacteria spores are.</p>
<p class="contents">You also quite rightly said that public health must take its proper place in the new Treaties for Europe. I am sorry to say that, so far, the constitutional Convention has not sent us this message or this position. As you quite rightly said. Just as the environment has an eminent position in the Treaties, so should public health. Health services are one thing – there is the question of subsidiarity – and public health protection is another because, as you know, viruses and various diseases and bio-terrorism do not recognise borders and can pass from country to country, from Member State to Member State and we must be able to respond in a coordinated manner. If we are to be able to do so, we need public health to have an eminent position in the Treaty of the European Union. So I agree with you and I would ask for you to persuade the other ministers to agree to set up this communicable diseases monitoring and control centre at European level and for us to persuade the constitutional Convention and the Council to give public health an eminent position in the new constitution of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I do admit that I found the results of this Extraordinary Council meeting very disappointing, if we consider that where SARS is concerned all we have are questions. This is an unknown virus. We do not really know what the routes of infection are. We do not know of any way of treating it, and we do not really know anything about the mortality rate. There are so many questions that the debate about a centre is just a distraction. I may be happy to discuss it in six months' time, but at the moment that is a course of action that glosses over and covers up what is really necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel exactly the same when I hear that the Member States have had a constructive exchange of views and are responsible for taking preventive measures. This is something that we have to change. It is high time that there was a Community competence for health policy, and I mean in the Treaty. If we do not recognise that now then I do not know when we will. We ought to have realised this even in the days of BSE. Much of what I am hearing today and have heard in the past is familiar to me: the economic impact – we said that too in the days of BSE. In the Minutes it says not to talk out loud about the dangers of BSE because heaven knows what economic consequences it will have. What consequences did it have in the end? What I would have liked from the Council is for it to have done something practical for once. Incidentally, I would have liked to see the Commission do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, I regret having to say this to you; I know that you are not responsible for this. I will repeat it to Mr Byrne; indeed, I have already said as much to him in this House. It is not acceptable for Mr Byrne to say, yes, research funding is a tricky one, the funds are tied up for such a long time. He should have gone straight to the Commission and said: come on then, chop-chop, release funds from the research framework programme, and do it now! We need money for research immediately, so that we can get things moving and mobilise all of our researchers so that we can establish what kind of a virus it is, whether it is possible to treat it and what vaccines are available. The Member States ought to have done exactly the same. When they were dispersing last week after the extraordinary meeting of the Council, I would have expected them to say: each of us is committed to putting x% or so many hundreds of thousands of euros on the table straight away for research.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make another unpopular statement: why are we not talking about restricting travel? Other countries are doing that. There are countries that have introduced entry restrictions. Why are we not doing so? Why are planes from my German airline and other airlines still able to travel around all over the place? We do not know anything about the infection channels. We have no idea how long the incubation period is. Is that as it should be? Why are we not having an honest discussion about quarantining? I think it would be responsible to do so, and I think that what the Member States have done and also what the Commission has done is both insufficient and irresponsible. I am denouncing that here and I would like you – that is those who bear the responsibility for this – to justify it to the people of Europe.</p>

The Council meeting naturally took place at a time when rumours and speculation about SARS were taking on huge proportions. The risk of confusion and misunderstandings about this highly infectious disease is therefore also increasing at an alarming rate. At the moment, however, we are still seeing different Member States giving conflicting travel advice about the so-called infected areas. It is the European Union’s duty to try to avoid this kind of confusion and misunderstandings. My country, for example, only issues negative travel advice on Beijing, Hong Kong and the Guangdong province. Other Member States are doing so for all infected areas. Why is there no clear European line on this point? The European Union, not only the Member States, should be taking action in this regard. That is not enough, however. SARS is pre-eminently a problem that does not respect national borders, and reminds us that problems such as these may also arise with other infectious diseases. When we see how quickly SARS has spread – perhaps not yet in Europe but certainly elsewhere – we must learn lessons from this, and not only now in respect of SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of 6 May called on the Commission to continue to coordinate the EU’s action in respect of SARS and to consider developing a plan concerning a general preparedness for transmittable diseases and public health threats. The European Centre has once again been mentioned. Perhaps this is enough at this point. Perhaps SARS is indeed something that has not spread so far that more stringent measures are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">What would we have done, however, if something like this had got out of hand? That might have happened. That could already have happened. Take the situation in Toronto – hardly a developing country, but a city with top-quality medical facilities that was suddenly gripped by SARS. That could have happened to us. What would we have done? Would we have asked the European Commission to do some consulting and coordinating? Would we have convened a meeting to see what we could do about it? No, what is lacking is the possibility of the European Commission implementing crisis management measures at such a time. I think that the European Commission should develop an emergency plan for this kind of situation, a plan which enables us to take concrete action in response to emergencies and then take measures such as those our American and Canadian colleagues are taking: quarantining people suspected of having the infection, providing additional funds for preventing the spread of the virus and support for people who are in voluntary or enforced quarantine.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems are broader than this. It is not just about SARS. Commissioner Byrne informed Parliament on 7 April about the possibility that the SARS virus was transferred to humans from animals. Take the Hong Kong flu last century, the Spanish flu last century, viruses that mutate, the fowl pest in the Netherlands at the moment, about which the World Health Organisation has expressed its concern. What should we do about these?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission needs to be able to implement practical crisis-management measures quickly for these kinds of situations in particular. I also welcome what the minister has said about this. The role of public health in the Treaty really must be laid down and reinforced now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They can also not be healed with medicines afterwards. There are only three ways of limiting the consequences. The first is to limit the chance of infection. The second is to reinforce and accelerate scientific research into preventing and fighting such diseases. The third is to offer help to those with the disease so as to increase their chances of survival. In the fight against the advance of SARS, only this third opportunity is being paid full attention. Hospitals are being prepared to ensure that they have quarantine rooms and breathing equipment available. It is a good thing that we are already taking on board the possibility that this infection could gain a significant foothold in Europe, but it looks as if this is as far as we are going.</p>
<p class="contents">The second method is not being given much thought. In the past, various Member States of the European Union have cut back on scientific research into new diseases. Today’s experts are interested volunteers who have been taken away from other medical and biological research. That must change if we are to be able to effectively fight and eradicate new diseases in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Our biggest shortcomings relate to the first method; containing the spread on a global scale. People from South-East Asia can quickly export SARS over great distances because of international air travel. Checks on incoming traffic at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, Europe’s fifth biggest airport, seem to be minimal. Passengers arriving from South-East Asia are allowed to just pass straight through. It is actually a miracle that more people have not been infected in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a declaration by the European Commission, I asked on 7 April for action to be taken against the risks posed by incoming air traffic, involving a previously announced compulsory period of quarantine for people at risk of infection if necessary. I am surprised that on 6 May, after consultation with the World Health Organisation, the Council decided not to do this and to rely instead on checks in the country of departure and written declarations by interested parties. Let us avoid a situation in which we find out afterwards that we failed seriously in our attempts to keep this disease out of our countries, and let us be pleased with our free press which, unlike in China, informed us in good time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must point out that the proposals advanced to the Commission by the UEN Group on that occasion have almost all been adopted by some of the Member States, including Italy. In the same speech, I warned that the virus could be transmitted via goods and animals from infected countries which were not yet known to be carrying the infection. After that difficult period of heated discussion between optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints on the possibility and necessity of stopping the spread of the virus, the European countries are now paying more heed to the issue, and more preventive measures are being taken too, but the time has come to concern ourselves with another factor. The problem which is gradually emerging in many Member States is that of public healthcare – are there enough staff, resources and facilities available to assist SARS patients? It is time to ask ourselves whether each Member State has these resources and appropriate centres for treating virulent infectious diseases such as SARS; if they do not, then all the measures taken to delay its arrival in Europe will be in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would add, the issues which need to be addressed most urgently are these: the lack, not to say complete absence, of negative pressure isolation rooms, necessary to prevent nosocomial infection, in the principal hospitals of the States of the European Union; the impossibility of quarantining a patient highly likely to have the disease but who refuses to be placed in isolation, due to the fact that there are no laws imposing enforced hospitalisation except on grounds of mental health; we need to start thinking about training, setting up specialised healthcare teams in the individual states to treat patients with diseases such as SARS, who cannot be given specific treatment but only adjunct treatment and who require input from a wide range of specialists – lung specialists, virologists, anaesthetists, resuscitation specialists, internists, dieticians – and nursing staff capable of managing and caring for patients suffering from SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to invite you to consider this viral disease as proof for Europe of the possibility of the transmission of diseases which are currently unknown to us or which we have stamped out in the past but which globalisation could bring back to Europe, as I said in my speech on 14 November 2001. The European Parliament and, in this case, the Commission – which I am addressing here – must learn from this experience and recognise the crucial role played by public health services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I reiterate, we have no say on the matter. Incidentally, thus far, the Commission has had no say on the matter in this House either.</p>
<p class="contents">This absurd situation does, however, reflect the times in which we live. I agree with some of the points made by Mr Mussa just now, but we must bear in mind that you, Antonio, are calling – like of many of us, moreover – for structural reforms, reform of nosocomial, hospital and even scientific structures. Structural reforms need to be first adopted by vote, desired and then implemented; then come the bribes and all the rest of it. In any case, we must have guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, there is an aspect which, as far as our area is concerned, is related to trade privileges, which sometimes play the role here which political and system interests play in the communist states, in the totalitarian – let us call them communist – states. (There are some minor fascist, nazi variations but the essence is the same). In actual fact, we have a situation of impending rampant zoonosis: in other words, diseases can be transmitted from animal to human being. Public health in Europe – here in our own countries – is under ever-increasing, extremely serious threat, for the world is becoming increasingly globalised and there are an increasing number of densely populated areas. Now, and I quote, Europe has been suffering for many months from orthomyxovirus strains causing – I repeat, which are currently causing, in other words this is happening right now, President-in-Office of the Council – extremely dangerous centres of avian influenza. Here in Europe, there are currently a number of extremely dangerous centres of avian influenza, the danger of which is often played down. Why is that? So as not to block the huge flows<span class="bold"> </span>of foodstuffs exports. The introduction of a vaccination would, of course, affect the export of these foodstuffs. We therefore chose to stamp out the disease instead, culling entire farm herds – 25 million head were destroyed in Holland and Belgium alone! It is true that these animals cost us a dollar a day – money which we do not give the world or even our unemployed in some cases – but it is also true that the culling is subsidised.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore in a situation where we lack specific knowledge – even after some, after many years, I am still not at all sure what the difference is between HIV and AIDS. All we can say is that infection experts fear an explosion in the autumn over and above the usual seasonal variation. I would point out that 600 000 died in Italy from Spanish influenza alone – as many as in a major world war. Take heed! This is not Europe – it is an absence of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Minister, the Extraordinary Council called for by the Italian Minister for Health, Professor Sirchia, yielded results which, although not minimum, were minimal and unsatisfactory. The outcome was a proposal to introduce medical protection in airports within a deadline of two months to check passengers <span class="italic">leaving</span> for these countries, in other words people returning to China, Hong Kong and the other areas where there is an epidemic situation already declared. In addition, the Extraordinary Council decided to create a European Coordination Centre to address health crises, which is only due to become operational in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, I believe that, despite the requests made essentially by Italy and Spain, we have given in to purely economic reasoning. It was you, Minister, who said that a difficult climate for the economy and society would be created. We believe that the citizens’ health is a question of much more than the mere short-term economic impact, although that is, of course, a consideration to be borne in mind, but it must not take priority over the citizens’ health.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt rightly said that we know nothing about the disease, and that is true, but we have not set up a European-scale filter which could be genuinely uniform and effective. Then Mr Panella pointed out the absurdity of the fact that we are equipped with a cutting-edge system for preventing animal epidemics but we have nothing for human beings. Everything is still in the hands of the states, which are giving economic considerations priority over respect for citizens’ health.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that Spanish influenza claimed hundreds of thousands of victims. That is not true, ladies and gentlemen – it claimed over 20 million! More recently, in 1957, Asian influenza claimed a million human lives, and then, in 1968, the Hong Kong variety caused 700 000 deaths. I wonder what we are doing to monitor the risk of an epidemic situation occurring in countries such as Africa or India, whose health systems would be totally incapable of controlling it at all, considering that even Toronto has been thrown into crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Minister, that the Council or the Commission must change their tune, speed up their decision-making and alter the citizens’ health policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot talk of prevention, control and timely intervention with communicable or other diseases unless we put the conditions in place for Community cooperation, especially today with enlargement and with citizens able to travel easily and quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that all the honourable Members who spoke referred unanimously to this need in their speeches; this has never happened in the past. Just like environmental problems, communicable diseases know no frontiers. Epidemics such as this atypical pneumonia epidemic call for transparency and direct information, a surveillance system that operates efficiently and health systems that get beyond bureaucratic malfunctions and offer the best possible services in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the World Health Organisation is fundamental, which is why cooperation between the WHO, the European Commission and the Member States has been effective. It is important to emphasise that the measures introduced at European Union level have restricted the spread of the disease and, most importantly, there have as yet been no fatalities in any Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Extraordinary Council held last week, I think it is important that the Council is pushing for the setting up of a special expert group on SARS to draw up joint programmes and advice on hygiene measures throughout Europe and provide information on measures taken so far and their results. It is also necessary to provide all manner of assistance to the affected areas. Exit points must be controlled in the same way as – if not more so than – entry points, using all administrative and scientific means.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to express my concern about the adequate application of measures decided so far. It would be advisable for the Commission to exercise as much influence as it can in this direction. Finally, may I congratulate the Greek Presidency on the sensitivity and readiness it demonstrated in convening the Extraordinary Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have personal experience of this: some of my family are about to travel to China on business. This is a situation that is facing many families in Europe, and we are not actually able to offer any definite advice, which is very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take up that keyword, China. We must denounce the complete inadequacy of the action taken by the Chinese Government here. It first played the issue down and kept it under wraps and then – at least in some cases – overreacted, even taking measures appropriate to a police state. In my view this provides yet more proof that in a dictatorship the challenges of modern society are not properly handled. That is one of the many reasons why we should continue to speak up for human rights and democracy, including in China.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing now in Europe? I am very grateful to Professor Stéfanis, the President-in-Office, but also to Professors Sirchia and Mattei, who were very active in supporting the initiative, and very grateful that this issue has been put on the Council agenda. The results are obviously not what we would have liked, but it is important to make a start and we may have more success at the next Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we have an internal market. I think that this is once again a time to point out that we can only have an internal market and that its advantages can only really be felt if we also take into account other aspects apart from the more narrow economic situation. There are many examples here and health is one of them. There are some people in my country who say that Europe should not have any competence for health protection. I am not one of them. I believe that at least when it comes to providing protection from infectious diseases and where bioterrorism is concerned we need additional competencies for the European Union. I have already discussed this problem with Commissioner Byrne and also with our Members in the Convention. Mr Brok, the chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Convention, has of course followed this debate and he agrees with me that we need additional competencies here.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not, however, be a universal panacea. We cannot now shift the current crisis into a Convention debate, but must look carefully at what measures it might be appropriate to take even now. That is why it is right, for example, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt said, to mobilise research funds quickly. It is right, as Mr Maaten pointed out, to issue uniform recommendations on travel into and out of the EU. I believe that we should do these things quickly, but at the same time we should send out the right signals in the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the global death toll rises and infection increases in China, there have also been cases in the EU, although the disease would appear to be very much under control here. However, 6% of people who contract SARS will die. To take the example of one survivor, Dr Henry Likyuen Chan was only 34 years old, but he had a high fever, was racked with a cough and when taking a shower felt as if he was running a marathon.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of an EU centre for disease control and prevention similar to the US model in Atlanta, which is not a new concept and is being promoted through the public health programme, goes some way towards coordination. However, it will take until 2005 to have such an agency up and running. Is this too little too late? It may be the right step to take for the future but it is very important for the Council to be open about the extra resources that it will make available for the centre, to deal not just with SARS but also with the issues surrounding TB, smallpox and bio-terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The added value of working together is what the EU is all about in public health policy, but this all comes at a cost and we should be very open about that. Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Liese have talked about the research aspect and it is my understanding also that the money for this is being made available through DG Research. It is important for this to be clarified, and perhaps the minister could tell us a little more about it. As we know, and he has stated, the source of this terrible mutant virus is still to be identified and we need to know more about what causes it.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, SARS is here and it is here to stay. We can do everything possible through research, early warning systems, disease control centres, education and information, but this should be a wake-up call to everyone concerned with public health. We need to work together across the EU and the globe to protect public health in the future and we must think seriously about how to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The response of the Council and the European Commission last week was, I think, adequate. However, those of us who know what possibly should have happened were rightly disappointed. It is true that there have not yet been any deaths attributable to SARS on our European Continent. But I would like to join my fellow Members Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Maaten and Mr Liese in making the point that this does not mean and it seemed rather like this that everything is therefore all right at the moment. We actually know far too little about where it comes from and how it is transmitted. We have no knowledge of any vaccines. All these things were held over at the time at that meeting of the Council. I regret that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that I regret is that it has been agreed not to take any additional measures to check everyone leaving an aircraft, because that would be a false security. What do I see? Days later the Italian Government is busy enacting these very measures. What security can I offer citizens now? I think that this is also the background to much of the criticism of my fellow Members.</p>
<p class="contents">As a second element I should like to mention the sixth action programme on public health. This programme was based on two things: rapid alert and prevention. What must I now actually conclude? That the Commission points out to us for the first time actually to have done something in the area of health, even though it is not within its competence. In this regard I note that the Commission did in fact already have this competence through that sixth action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I come to the remarks of my fellow Member Mr Maaten, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Trakatellis who ask why no extra money is being released immediately for tracing the connections, for making vaccines, for doing something. Mr President, in my opinion that means we have fallen short and we must now immediately try better to support and to trace the problems and the ignorance, not only with SARS, but everything else that comes our way, to respond more alertly, as we set out in the sixth action programme. But, Mr President, consider also the competences in the area of public health. They are needed more than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their sense of responsibility should be an example to the authorities, not only those in the Netherlands, but also to their European counterparts. The measures against SARS are inadequate. Unfortunately no other conclusion is possible at the moment. SARS is a disease whose risks and dangers are still largely unknown. The mortality rate was initially estimated at 4%, now there are estimates of 19%. Infection was originally thought only to occur through the air. Now it seems that the virus can enter the human body in various other ways. We must take the greatest of care in dealing with SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, and it has been said many times before, there must be joint action. Confidence in the government is important. We cannot have one country maintaining that there really is nothing the matter and another making quarantine compulsory, that does not create confidence. We must also have joint travel advice because there certainly is something the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the measures must, of course, be convincing. The disease has proved more serious and more infectious than was thought. It is a good thing to trace people who may be carriers, but our first concern is, of course, to prevent infection occurring in the European Union. Italy is quite right to make quarantine compulsory for people coming from areas of risk. Everyone who says that draconian measures do not offer definitive protection are right as well of course, but this does not make it the false security that is being suggested. These measures do help to reduce the number of carriers. You prevent panic by taking adequate measures and not by acting as if there is nothing amiss.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union and the Member States must now take responsibility. Cases of SARS have also been discovered in Greece and Finland. We cannot allow quarantine to be an individual decision of responsible people. Let the sense of responsibility of some hospital workers act as an example.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Stefanis, you have heard in this debate that there is a very great consensus for a stricter and clearer approach. What are you going to do as a result of this debate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the developed western countries the situation remains under control, as things stand, but for the poor, less developed countries it might turn into a new scourge on a huge scale, one which, both directly and through its economic impact, will increase poverty, misery and the death rate. The epidemic is already now threatening what was already poor economic growth in Asian countries and, through a series of reflex actions, the entire global economy. We must also prepare for what will be a huge demand for humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The epidemic has been going on for only eight weeks, but one thing is certain: the decision-makers have a major role to play. There has to be a guarantee of global stability and order, because that will be crucial from the point of view of health care systems and prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland, just one case of the disease has been reported: it was someone who fell ill having returned from a trip to Toronto. A high-ranking health official in Canada, however, has been quick to deny the possibility of infection. In a report in the Toronto Star, for example, it says that unless someone had managed to slip into a hospital to see a SARS patient in quarantine it was totally idiotic to claim that anyone had caught an infectious disease in Canada. Opinions such as these vividly bring to mind the attitude of leaders of the former Eastern Bloc countries, which was that people could not catch infectious diseases in their countries. It is incredible that the Canadian health authorities should succumb to a childish, face-saving quarrel about where the disease has come from.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of attitude does not help anyone. If cases of the disease are found, the health authority should have other things to do than protect its country’s business and tourism. At a general level, this shows how badly the authorities in the Western countries have prepared themselves mentally for the spread of new and dangerous infectious diseases. The extraordinary meeting of the EU Member States’ Health Ministers, with its recommendations for action, was nevertheless an important first step, but we expect more. The EU needs more powers when it comes to infectious diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">One more detail with regard to the SARS situation deserves comment. Italy was dissatisfied with the decision of the Council of Ministers concerning action to prevent SARS, and decided to break away temporarily from the Schengen Agreement so as to be able to conduct checks itself on the state of health of people coming into the country. Whether the decision by Italy was necessary or a case of over-reacting, it none the less shows how flexible major EU agreements can be in exceptional situations if a Member State is able to propose its non-compliance with them justifiably. In this respect the EU has passed a practical test with good marks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No virus has the capacity to comprehend the notions of subsidiarity, proportionality and territoriality. It simply passes around as it chooses. Therefore Member States should drop the notion that they are in some way protecting their populations by defending the idea of sovereignty, or indeed the idea that they are protecting their economies by pleading subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we back the Commissioner's proposal for a centre for communicable diseases, but we should be insisting that every Member State put money up front for this centre. It is nonsense to try to ensure that we have a body which in the long term will deal with communicable diseases but which will not have the resources to do its job effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have not heard today – perhaps I missed it because I was a bit late for the President-in-Office's speech at the beginning – is what progress has been made in relation to finding a vaccine. I know some progress has been made in identifying the virus, but what progress has been made in identifying a vaccine for us?</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there are concerns in Greece in relation to the Olympics due to take place in 2004, and that various discussions are taking place on this matter. In my own country, Ireland, we have the Special Olympics in June of this year; around 7 000 athletes will be travelling from 166 states across the world. 500 of these 7 000 athletes will be coming from areas affected by SARS. There are clearly concerns in Ireland, especially in those towns hosting these particular athletes. I for one am not calling for a ban on the Special Olympics. I want it to go ahead, but I want to reassure people that adequate measures are being taken at European and national levels to ensure that the SARS virus does not spread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stefanis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your very interesting questions, which I shall try to answer. I cannot answer them all in detail because, as far as I understand, time is limited, but I shall try to do what I can.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the general state of affairs as far as atypical pneumonia or SARS is concerned. As I said, we know from the Commission and from Mrs Brundtland herself, who has a global view of the matter, that although it has been identified – and this is a fact – in record time compared with what has been done in the past and we have identified the molecular structure of the virus on the one hand; on the other hand, however, no substantial progress has been made in the field of its natural history, in other words on how the virus is transmitted, and there is at present no visible progress on an efficient vaccine to prevent the disease or any anti-viral medication to treat it. Consequently, treatment is merely palliative and what we really need, for patients at least, is for them to be isolated so that the virus does not spread and cause hospital infections, meaning that we need to recommend that every country that does not have negative pressure chambers should acquire them. This is a very basic measure in order to restrict the spread of the virus and prevent hospital infections.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to offer some clarification on the cases in Holland and Greece. There has been a suspected – not a confirmed – case in Greece since yesterday, which is being investigated. In all events, the fact is that there are also cases in Europe. Luckily, however, as we said, no case has yet been fatal. I am especially pleased that there is a broad consensus about the need for public health to be given top priority in the EU Treaty and in all EU activities in general. I listened to Mr Panella talk of the paradox, and it is indeed a paradox, that we have protection from zoonoses and no protection for human health. This is something that must also be addressed at the Convention; but perhaps there could be joint actions in this direction even now. This prospect is now a possibility and we, the presidency, agree with – and we do not just agree, we are backing – the Commission's efforts to promote the foundation of a disease prevention and control centre in general, not just for communicable diseases. There are diseases which are as important and harmful as communicable diseases. Something like the Centre of Disease Control in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say something about what was to be expected from this Extraordinary Council and what ultimately came of it. To start with, I think that it was very positive that this Council was held and that, as a result of SARS, public health was the focus of attention not just of the ministers but of public opinion in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as a text of commonly accepted conclusions had somehow to be drafted, it was only natural for this text not to contain contradictory positions. The text in general was the result of compromise. Nonetheless, there were recommendations on important measures, such as air travel. Emphasis was put, and is being put in the World Health Organisation, on departure controls at exit points. However, this does not mean that there should not be controls. The Commission and the Council recommended that there should at least be some sort of administrative – not public health or medical – control, as the Italian minister, Mr Sirchia insisted.</p>
<p class="contents">But however many controls we conduct at entry points, when we are up against a virus with a ten-day incubation period, it is only natural that we should have limited results, because people entering the country are healthy. Almost all cases in countries other than the basic countries, by which I mean China, Hong Kong and Singapore, are people who entered other countries as healthy people and later manifested the disease. Consequently, any entry controls will restrict considerably but will not wipe out the danger of bringing in the virus. A great many topics were touched on. However, everyone agreed on the need for a common European policy on the issue and on health matters in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency believes that it is possible, on the basis of the specific conditions which prevail in the country and how the dangers which come from outside are perceived and evaluated, for every Member State to take the corresponding measures. However, there are some which should be joint measures for all the Member States of the European Union and, first and foremost, there is a need for coordination, at least at the information level. A common compulsory information centre, as is the case now with the network for compulsory registration of all probable and possible cases is, I think, an important step because this will give us the epidemiological picture on the basis of which certain measures can be taken to deal with the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of research, the presidency agrees with maximum possible support for research activities at European level. There should be a common fund, in addition to the fund already set up in Directorate XII, a special fund to deal with this sort of emergency. However, we should not forget that most research is carried out in universities and large international pharmaceutical companies. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that we also need European research activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question arises, the question of support for those areas affected by the virus, so that they can take the necessary measures. As Mr Liese said, we must not overlook the fact that, if the cases in China had been reported promptly, we probably would not have reached this point. This is something that should serve as a lesson to us all from now on; that there are no borders and that, whatever happens anywhere in the world needs to be reported, there should be a reporting centre and that is precisely what the World Health Organisation is. However, we need similar centres at regional level, such as the surveillance network of the European Union, to which we should report.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, may I say that, generally, what happened at the Extraordinary Council on 6 May was a very good beginning. The ordinary Council of Ministers will meet on 2 June, by which time more facts will have been gathered, account will be taken of all the observations made by the honourable Members of the European Parliament and, I think, the Member States of the European Union will be in a position to be more coordinated and more specific about the measures which need to be taken at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
