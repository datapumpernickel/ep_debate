<p>(DA) The latest EU-Russia Summit, held on 11 November in Brussels, has been widely judged to have been a great success. Despite a difficult political context, it yielded vital agreement between leaders on both sides on how to deal with Kaliningrad. This was an important result on the way to EU enlargement. Apart from the agreement on Kaliningrad, we were able to reach agreement on Joint Statements concerning the Middle East and the fight against terrorism. We also noted good progress made on the Common European Economic Space, and on the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue. Such results would not have been possible if the Summit had not taken place.</p>
<p>Member States were kept informed at all stages in the preparations of the Summit. Proof that this was done completely and effectively comes from the fact that, since the Summit, the Presidency has received warm praise for its transparent handling of the preparations. On the particular question of moving the Summit from Copenhagen to Brussels, the Presidency at all times expressed the positions of the Council and of the Union. The Presidency received the full support of Member States.</p>
<p>The Presidency absolutely agrees that it is important for the Council to speak with one voice. It was this clarity that allowed the Summit to go ahead in a successful manner. The Council has been united and Russia has taken good note of the EU’s position. Mr Rasmussen, on behalf of the Council, made clear after the Summit that Chechnya was an important subject of discussion between the two sides. The EU was able to use the occasion to put its view that a political settlement is an essential condition to achieving a lasting peace in the region. In Copenhagen, the European Council (12/13 December 2002) recalled that the enlargement will strengthen relations with Russia</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will know, there have been a number of developments since this question was submitted. First, a Danish court refused a request for him to be extradited and ordered him freed. Then Mr Zakayev flew to the UK, where he was detained on arrival. He has since been remanded on conditional bail, and is due to return to Court on 9 January 2003.</p>
<p>Given that the case of Mr Zakajev is currently still a matter for the judiciary, it is not appropriate for anyone else to make any comment at this stage.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0758"></a>

<p>(DA) As the Honourable Parliamentarian is aware, the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 laid down the political criteria for accession which stipulate that candidate countries must have achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. All candidate countries with which accession negotiations have been opened fulfil the political criteria. This has been of course strongly confirmed by the decision of the last European Council in Copenhagen, to conclude negotiation with Latvia, among others.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Union has closely followed the question of national minorities in Latvia in the past and will continue to monitor it until the accession process is fully completed. This issue has been included amongst the priorities of the revised Accession Partnership for Latvia, adopted in January 2002, and has regularly been discussed with the Latvian side in the framework of the Europe Agreement bodies, in particular the Association Council which held its latest meeting in February this year.</p>
<p>The 2002 Regular Report from the Commission on Latvia's progress towards accession , issued in October, concluded that Latvia continued to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria. More specifically, this report stated that: 'Latvia has encouraged the further integration of non-citizens into Latvian society by removing language requirements in the election law, and increasing support to facilitate the naturalisation process, and through the activities of the Society Integration Foundation.'. The Report also underlined that 'the integration process needs to be accelerated and sufficient funding made available to encourage naturalisation and language training in particular'.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it can be said that Latvia has taken a number of concrete measures as concerns integration of non-citizens into society, and that these positive developments should be acknowledged, as also confirmed by the decision taken by the OSCE in last December not to extend the mandate of its mission. At the same time, the Union will continue to monitor the situation, particularly with regard to the implementation of the adopted measures, and to encourage Latvia to build on the progress already made. The European Council, in Copenhagen, 12-13 December 2002, underlined that monitoring up to accession of the commitments undertaken will give further guidance to the acceeding States in their efforts to assume responsibilities of membership and will give the necessary assurance to current Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0762"></a>

<p>(DA) The Council is not aware of any meeting between the European Union and Iran scheduled to take place on 16 and 17 November 2002. The Council can confirm, however, that a working group on energy, consisting of competent representatives of the European Commission, and of the Iranian Government, met in Teheran on 19 October 2002.</p>
<p>This meeting was not a 'launch of negotiations' but one of several activities in the framework of the EU-Iran Comprehensive Dialogue; it was in fact the third such meeting of this group to take place since 1998 Pending negotiation of a new contractual relationship between the EU and Iran, the Comprehensive Dialogue serves as a forum for raising issues of concern, such as human rights, but also for exploring promising areas of cooperation between the EU and Iran, such as energy. Any such co-operation must been seen in the overall global political context within which all relations with Iran now have to be considered.</p>
<p>There is thus no link between the meeting of the working group on energy on 19 October and the Council's conclusions of 21 October. The Council would moreover like to point out that no decision was taken on 21 October on whether or not to table a resolution on Iran at the 59<span class="sup">th</span> session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, due to commence in March 2003.</p>
<p>The Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the exact terms of this declaration which sets out its position regarding the opening of a human rights dialogue with Iran.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0767"></a>

<p>(DA) The Council would point out that the EU's institutions are to cooperate as effectively as possible while fully complying with the rules adopted.</p>
<p>As regards the proposal for a directive on legal aid, the Council requested the European Parliament on 1 February 2002 to deliver an opinion on the basis of the Commission's proposal. It hoped to receive the opinion as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As amendments were made to the proposal for a directive during proceedings in the Council, and since Parliament had not yet delivered its opinion, the Council decided that it would brief Parliament in a letter of 22 September 2002 on the progress of the proceedings so that it could deliver its opinion in the light of the amendments that the Council's bodies had made to the proposal.</p>
<p>The European Parliament has, therefore, had the opportunity to express its opinion both on the basis of the Commission's proposal and the latest version of the text, which the Council forwarded to it. In the legislative resolution of 25 September 2002, the European Parliament refers expressly in fact to 'the revised version' which the Council forwarded ('having regard to the revised version of the Council Directive (10856/2002-C5-0423/2002')). The Council must, therefore, point out that Parliament has delivered its opinion in full knowledge of the progress of proceedings in the Council, as evidenced by the revised version. The text has not subsequently been amended so substantially as to warrant further consultation.</p>

<p>The events of 1991 in northern Iraq, which caused enormous loss of life among the Kurds and a stream of 1.5 million outgoing Kurdish refugees, were followed by a very troubled period of civil strife and foreign intervention with tragic consequences for the population. According to persistent rumours regarding a possible future invasion of Iraq, around 30 000 Kurds will be used as backup ground forces. If this is true it will greatly compound the suffering of the local inhabitants.</p>

<p>(DA) The future of the Kurds in Iraq is of course inevitably linked to the future of Iraq. The Council’s view, and indeed the view of the international community as a whole, is that Iraq must fully honour its obligations under the United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The UN weapons inspectors are now back in Iraq after nearly 4 years, working under a strengthened inspection regime, decided unanimously by the Security Council in Resolution 1441. This Resolution clearly points out the obligations which Saddam Hussein must fulfil in order to avoid serious consequences for Iraq and it sets the conditions for a peaceful solution of the crisis. The purpose is to have disarmed, peaceful Iraq.</p>
<p>The Council has not discussed the future of the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq and their local administration. The Council's main concern is to ensure that the prospect of weapons of mass destruction in Iraqi hands is stopped, and that those weapons are eliminated.</p>
<p>The European Council in Copenhagen (12-13 December 2002) confirmed that this goal remained a priority. It underlined its full and unequivocal support for the Security Council Resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002 and considered it was now up to Iraq to seize this final opportunity to comply with its international obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0784"></a>

<p>(DA) The Presidency of the Council has today given a declaration to the European Parliament regarding actions taken to reduce the effects of the Prestige disaster.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 7, 8 and 9 December 2000 in Nice, the European Council instructed the Member States to implement ahead of schedule the provisions agreed on by the 15 Member States with a view to improving the European signalling and information system for maritime traffic, to set up a European Maritime Safety Agency and to remedy the shortcomings of the existing international system of liability and compensation and to do as long as these do not require an international framework.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and Council regulation on setting up a European Maritime Safety Agency entered into force on 25 August 2002, although it contains no provision for deciding on a permanent location for its headquarters.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this situation does not affect the obligation, laid down in the regulation, to adopt the necessary measures for the Agency to be operational within the twelve months following its entry into force. It is also planned that the Agency will provisionally undertake its work in buildings belonging to the European Commission in Brussels.</p>
<p>The European Council which, at its meeting in Gothenburg (15/16 June 2001), gave a commitment to pursue its efforts to reach a decision on the location of several future bodies, it being understood that the decision taken in Edinburgh in 1992 still applies, has since welcomed the creation of this Agency.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Agency’s governing board took place on 4 December 2002. On that occasion, the Agency’s action plan was decided on. The appointment of the Agency’s executive director is expected to take place in January 2003. On the occasion of its meeting on 6 December 2002, the Council noted with satisfaction those developments and expected the rapid adoption of a working programme which will enable the Agency to be operational as soon as possible and to establish the principles that can serve as a basis for actions to be taken at Community level and in a wider international context. This should include the promotion of uniformity and quality of port controls inspection in all ports of the Members States, as well as, for the Commission, the establishment and the monitoring of the procedures for the authorisation and the control of classification societies.</p>
<p>The Council has taken notice of the Parliament's intention as regards the Budget 2003 to put 50 % of the financial resources for the European Maritime Safety Agency in reserve awaiting final decision on permanent location. If this position of the European Parliament is maintained, it will make it more difficult for those involved to make the agency fully operational as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the Commission's decision, as mentioned in its communication to the Council and the European Parliament on improving safety at sea in response to the Prestige accident (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0681">COM(2002) 681</a> final), to provisionally house the Agency on its own premises. The Council also welcomes the information given by the Commission in this communication that the Commission has done everything to make the Agency operational six months ahead of schedule.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0820"></a>

<p>(DA) In order to combat infringements of intellectual property rights at the EU's external borders, the Council adopted on 22 December 1994 Regulation (EC) No. 3295/94 laying down measures to prohibit the release for free circulation, export, re-export or entry for a suspensive procedure of counterfeit and pirated goods. That Regulation was amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 241/1999 to extend its scope so that the customs authorities can now intervene even before customs clearance. Regulation (EC) No. 241/1999 also extended the competence of the customs authorities in relation to the protection of intellectual property rights so that it now also encompasses patents and supplementary protection certificates, for example.</p>
<p>The Council's decision of 6 December 2001 extended Europol's mandate to deal with the serious forms of international crime listed in the Annex to the Europol Convention<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> so that Europol now also has competence in relation to counterfeiting and piracy.</p>

No measures have at the moment been submitted to the Council under Title VI of the EU Treaty concerning further strengthening of protection under criminal law against counterfeiting and piracy. New instruments such as the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters and the recent establishment of Eurojust could nevertheless make a contribution to an effective response to this serious form of offence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Whilst the Commission is satisfied in principle with the implementation that Greece has undertaken of the Directive regarding the Internal Market for Electricity (96/92), it is fully aware that the Greek electricity market, as is the case in certain other Community markets, is as yet by no means characterised as a fully competitive market; and this despite the two additional years of derogation applicable for Greece up to February 2001. As yet few new competitors have established themselves in Greece.</p>
<p>The main way that Greece attempted to improve the level of competition in the electricity market was through issuing seven licences to seven consortia of independent private companies (IPP’s) for the construction of seven new generation plants with a total capacity of more that 2000 Megawatt (MW). This new capacity would offer enough room for competition, and also solve the problem of security of electricity supply of Greece (as an additional capacity of 500 to 600 MW for 2005 is estimated to be required).</p>
<p>However, none of the seven IPP’s has advanced substantially up to now with the construction of new plants mainly for various reasons of financing.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Authority for energy (RAE) prepared a full revision of Law 2773/1999 in early September 2002 and submitted it to the Ministry of Development for approval. It is expected that the Ministry of Development will issue soon its final proposal for the revision of the Law based on the text of RAE, maybe with some modifications and additions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the political agreement of the Energy Council on the new Electricity internal market Directive, due to enter into force in 2004, will also lead to an intensification of competition over the coming years.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission is following with interest the above process and expects the final revision of the Law in order to examine its compliance to the Electricity Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission intends to amend and update its decision of 22 October 1993 setting up EURES.

<p>One of the features of the Commission's proposal to revise the decision is to establish closer links between EURES and the national employment services, primarily with the forthcoming enlargement of the EU in view. This proposal, however, gives rise to a number of questions concerning the independence of the regional partnerships, in particular their financial independence, from the national labour market authorities.</p>

<p>(EN) The reform aims to make EURES a more efficient instrument to support mobility on the European labour market and to ensure that EURES remains manageable after Union enlargement. To achieve this:</p>
<p>EURES must be fully integrated into the activities of the public employment services. This is the way to fully implement Council Regulation 1612/1968 of 15 October 1968 on the free movement of workers<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which requires that the specialist service of each Member State (generally their Public Employment Services) shall send to the specialist service of the other Member States and to the European Co-ordination office details of job vacancies and applicants according to a uniform system. The reform reiterates that information on all vacancies has to be made available and that EURES cannot be regarded as a marginal activity.</p>
<p>The management system must be updated. The Commission needs to concentrate on strategy, overall co-ordination and evaluation, while more operational tasks should be left to the Member States.</p>
<p>Under the Regulation the public employment services must also make concrete commitments to developing cross-border activities.</p>
<p>In the new system, cross-border activities will become part of the activity plans that the Member States' public employment services will present to the Commission. The Commission will grant financial assistance for the execution of these activity plans subject to the decisions of the budgetary authority and the rules governing the relevant budgetary resources.</p>
<p>The role of the social partners will be crucial to the reform. At European Level, the European social partner organisations will be invited to participate in the EURES High Level Strategy Group established by the new decision and in the EURES Working Party in charge of the development, implementation and monitoring of EURES activities. At national and regional level they can be partners in the cross-border partnerships.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not considering a proposal to impose tough sanctions on new Member States if they fail to fully implement Union rules and honour all the commitments of membership.</p>
<p>In its Strategy Paper ‘Towards enlargement’ adopted on 9 October 2002, the Commission has proposed to include into the Accession Treaty certain safeguard clauses in addition to the clauses allowing exceptions from the rules of the internal market in the Treaty establishing the European Community and safeguard clauses in secondary legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal to include into the Accession Treaty, besides a general economic safeguard clause similar to the one included into the previous enlargement treaty, one specific safeguard clause concerning the internal market and one specific clause relating to the area of justice and home affairs, have been endorsed by the Brussels European Council (24-25 October 2002). It is clear that safeguard measures which might be taken must be proportional in scope and duration vis-à-vis the nature of the problem which might occur. These safeguard clauses will allow for a more flexible reaction to possible problems associated with the initial period of membership.</p>
<p>Work on the exact wording of the clauses is still ongoing. The general economic safeguard clause may be invoked against both old and new Member States in case of serious difficulties in an economic sector or the economic situation of a given area. Concerning the two specific safeguard clauses, these may only be invoked where a new Member State does not meet the commitments it has made during accession negotiations and where this results in a serious breach of the functioning of the internal market, or where there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of the criminal law under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union as well as civil law under Title IV of the Treaty on the European Union. The two specific safeguard clauses will be applicable up to three years after accession and will serve to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and mutual recognition in the civil and criminal law area. They will compliment the Commission’s usual instruments which ensure compliance with Union law. Beyond that period, the Commission will apply the usual measures of ensuring the proper implementation of the acquis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0723"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission very much regrets the events the honourable Member refers to in his question. Unfortunately, these tragedies are taking place more and more frequently.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced of the need to develop policies on preventing and combating illegal immigration in order to prevent any repetition of these events in the future. In order to be effective, these policies must be developed in partnership with third countries of origin and of transit.</p>
<p>Several measures have already been adopted at European level. On 28 February 2002, the Council adopted a global plan for combating illegal immigration and human trafficking in the Union, and on 13 June 2002 a global plan for the integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the Union. These two plans follow up Commission Communications in these fields.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several meetings of experts in the field of illegal immigration by sea have taken place on the initiative of the Commission. Their aim has been to identify operational measures for preventing and combating illegal immigration in the Mediterranean region. The implementation of the measures contained in these plans will be of great assistance in preventing any repetition of these tragedies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is aware that all these measures will not be able to resolve, by themselves, such a complex problem. As was pointed out by the Seville European Council, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, an integrated approach aimed at tackling the underlying causes of illegal immigration must continue to be the Union’s long-term objective.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission will attempt to ensure that cooperation with third countries in the field of migration is integrated in a balanced and coherent way into the Community’s relations with these third countries, taking account both of the needs of the partner countries and the interests of the Community, which will allow us to combat illegal immigration and to directly tackle the causes underlying migratory movements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0733"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the statement by the Chairwoman of the Czech nuclear safety authority SUJB, Ms. Dana Drabova, in an interview to the Czech newspaper 'Lidove novine' on 18 September 2002 on the issue of the high-energy pipes at the Temelin NPP.</p>
<p>The Commission recalls that the June 2001 Council Report on Nuclear Safety in the Context of Enlargement, as the key document defining the Union’s approach towards candidate countries on nuclear safety issues, recommends that the Czech Republic should 'ensure the safety case demonstrating appropriate protection against high energy pipe breaks'.</p>
<p>The Commission also recalls that Annex I of the 'Conclusions of the Melk Process and Follow-up', established between Chancellor Schüssel and then Prime Minister Zeman on 29 November 2001, contains an identical definition of the measures to be undertaken by the Czech Republic; in fact, these conclusions specifically refer to the said Council Report.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Commission does not base its appreciation of the Czech Republic’s measures on media reports. Whilst the Commission provided its good offices to mediate this process in 2001, it is not the guardian of its implementation. The follow-up is entirely a bilateral matter between Austria and the Czech Republic. However, the Czech Republic provided information on this specific issue of the Temelin NPP to the European Institutions on 4 November 2002. Therein, the Czech authorities summarised the results of the investigation conducted over the last year to assess the actual technical options available to accomplish the task of ensuring the safety case. The Commission is aware that the Czech authorities have made use of domestic as well as Member State expertise to conduct their in-depth investigation. The Commission services are currently evaluating the information received.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0736"></a>

<p>(EN) Gender mainstreaming in the rural development policy is part of the general Commission framework for gender mainstreaming of Community policies. It contributes to the implementation of important aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy, including rural development, and of Community initiatives, such as Leader+, which are seeking to boost activities in favour of women. These programmes, which are set for the period 2000-2006, will pursue the purpose of promoting gender equality in the measures co-financed by the Union (as stated in Article 2 of the Council Regulation N° 1257/99).</p>
<p>It is necessary to recognise the growing role of women in rural areas and to strengthen their position in the economy and in society through concrete measures and actions. The rural development policy offers ample opportunities for Member States to include such measures in their programmes and to support new activities in rural areas so that more rural women can be involved.</p>
<p>For this reason, the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the Parliament will be taken into account in future decisions. As an example, in the context of the information policy the Commission will continue to support women’s organisations and associations in rural areas, will encourage capacity building and help creating a space for women where they can express their needs and develop their projects, as in many cases, it is one of the major difficulties for women to make their voices heard and to influence policy in a way that better corresponds to their specific approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0740"></a>

<p>In an interview in the French newspaper Le Monde on 17 October 2002, the Commission President, Romano Prodi, said: 'I know very well that the stability pact is idiotic, like all rigid decisions ... the stability pact is not perfect, it is true, because a more intelligent tool and greater flexibility is required'.</p>

<p>(EN) In terms of overall humanitarian situation, there has been some improvement, albeit slow in the Chiapias region.</p>
<p>This is due on one hand to the 'calming down' of the conflict which has claimed less displacement and suffering over the last months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the significant international assistance over the last years has helped improving the living conditions of the Indians.</p>
<p>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as well as the partners in the field (National Societies of the Red Cross in Germany and Spain) share this assessment.</p>
<p>The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) which has been present in the Chiapas since 1994, is one of the leading donors. It has played a key role in supporting the relief efforts of humanitarian organisations.</p>
<p>ECHO currently finances the IFRC, the German Red Cross and the Spanish Red Cross. In this regard, the affirmation that the non governmental organisation (NGO) Médecins du Monde is financed by ECHO is incorrect. This NGO is financed via the co-financing budget line of the Union -B7-6000 (managed by EuropeAid Office) for a specific project (ONG-PVD/1999/850) that commenced in 1999 and should finish in the first half of 2003 according to the terms of the proposal submitted by the NGO itself. The Selection Committee for the recent Call for Proposals for this budget line has proposed the financing of a new contract in favour of this same NGO and for the same region from the 2002 budget with a starting date in 2003.</p>
<p>ECHO does not intend to disengage from Chiapas this year. However, the situation which affects the people of the Chiapas region is now falling more into the grey zone between humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and development. Faced with an improved situation, the IFRC and the partners in the region foresee a progressive reduction in humanitarian activities to be replaced by co-operation instruments.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate the impact of the humanitarian aid provided to date, ECHO intends to finance a final programme for 2003 in favour of displaced people in the state of Chiapas. This new programme aims to strengthen the productive potential and the skills of displaced people so as to reduce their dependence on humanitarian aid. Actions will be aimed at encouraging peaceful coexistence between the returning populations and those who stayed and at developing post-emergency rehabilitation activities. This will help ensure a smooth transition towards development aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0742"></a>

<p>(EN) It is widely accepted that social protection policies, including pension policies, should remain the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission has no intention of changing this.</p>
<p>However, all Member States are facing similar challenges concerning the future development of their social protection policies. This is particularly the case in relation to the impact of an ageing population on the national pension systems. Indeed, the provision of safe and sustainable pensions in the context of demographic ageing will soon be seen as one of the greatest challenges facing our social policies. Member States will have to ensure the social adequacy of pensions systems, whilst guaranteeing their financial sustainability as well as their capacity to adapt to changing societal needs.</p>
<p>The new open method of co-ordination that has been developed for the area of pensions with its comprehensive approach covering adequacy, sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems is the right way forward. It will prove to be a valuable tool to address the common challenges.</p>
<p>The commitment of all Member States to the 11 common objectives that were presented to the Laeken European Council (14-15 December 2001) is welcomed by the Commission. The aim of the open method of co-ordination should be to support Member States in their reform efforts through mutual learning and peer reviews. It will increase the ability of national policy makers to assess relative performance, raise awareness of other policy options and promote a better understanding of the advantages and problems of these different options.</p>
<p>However, imposing a single, uniform policy approach which would not take account of different traditions and aspirations in the Member States should not be the aim. So, it should be left to each Member State to further develop its pension system, including the balance between 1<span class="sup">st</span> , 2<span class="sup">nd</span> and 3<span class="sup">rd</span> pillar schemes and how to guarantee a minimum level of income for older people.</p>
<p>The first result of this new open method of co-ordination will be a joint report by the Commission and the Council to the Spring 2003 European Council. This should be the right moment to examine whether further initiatives are required.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0744"></a>

<p>With the Union there is a wide divergence about right-to-ownership of stolen goods. For example, in the United Kingdom their common law vests title in the original owner - which makes resale of stolen goods difficult within that country. In Luxembourg, however, the buyer of stolen goods is safe if no legal challenge is launched within seven days. Even worse, in Italy the title to the stolen goods is transferred immediately at the moment of sale.</p>
<p>With open borders, these divergences make theft of valuable works of art comparatively easy. Does the Commission have any plan to propose counter-measures ?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. Penal law</p>
<p>The Commission is examining the need for the approximation of penal national laws concerning receiving and handling stolen goods among other things and sanctions in this field. This issue has also been discussed during a work shop on the prevention of illicit trafficking in cultural goods, organised by the Commission with relevant public and private sector stakeholders, that took place on 9 December 2002 in Brussels as part of the Forum for the prevention of organised crime.</p>
<p>Concerning judicial and police co-operation between Member States, the Commission would in particular like to point out that under the programme AGIS managed by the Commission, Community funding will make available since 2003 for projects which include the analysis of the juridical obstacles to the co-operation between European law enforcement. Furthermore, the illicit trafficking in cultural goods, antiques and works of art is included in the scope of the European Arrest Warrant by Article 2 of the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member states<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>2. Community legal instruments</p>
<p>The establishment of a Single Market has also meant that from 1993 onwards Member States are no longer allowed to make physical checks at the Community’s internal borders. As this can facilitates the illegal traffic of cultural goods, the Community had to adopt measures accompanying the completion of the internal market to supplement the protection afforded to national treasures by national rules with a common system of protection at the Community level. These measures are the Regulation of 9 December 1992 on the export of cultural goods<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Directive of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects illegally removed from the territory of a Member State<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Regulation stipulates that any export of cultural goods listed in its Annex shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence issued by the competent authorities of the Member States. Furthermore, the Regulation introduces uniform controls for the prevention of exports of cultural goods at the external borders of the Community, which allow the competent culture and customs authorities of the Member State from which the cultural goods are to be exported to a third country to take the interests of the other Member State into account, following either lawful and definitive dispatch from this Member State.</p>
<p>The Directive is directly linked to the Regulation and shares a common Annex. It provides mechanisms and a procedure between Member States for restoring national treasures when these have been unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State after 1 January 1993. The Article 15 of the Directive provides that the Directive shall be without prejudice to any civil or criminal proceedings that may be brought, under the national laws of the Member States, by the requesting Member State and/or the owner of a cultural object that has been stolen.</p>
<p>3. Civil law</p>
<p>The right-to-ownership of stolen goods touches also the general area of property law. Initiatives in this area have been taken in the context of the debate launched by the Head of States and Governments in Tampere, October 1999 (paragraph 39 of the Tampere conclusions).</p>
<p>In a report of 16 November 2001 'on the need to approximate Member States' legislation in civil matters', the Council took note of the initiatives in this area by the Parliament and by the Commission. As far as property law is concerned, the Council considered it to be wise to examine whether the differences in the laws of the Member States in this area constitute barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market in practice. It called on the Commission to conduct a study on this subject-matter.</p>
<p>The Commission has published in July 2002 a call for tender specifying that the aim of this study is to determine whether there are interferences, delimitation problems or even terminology or conceptual differences, resulting mainly from mandatory provisions, between property law and contract law, which might create real or likely obstacles to the smooth running of the internal market or competition imbalances. The aim is, therefore, not to examine property law as a whole, or to compare national legal frameworks, but to analyse the problems and obstacles resulting from differences in legal frameworks in contract and commercial practice.</p>
<p>The Commission will integrate the results of this study in the context of its forthcoming follow-up to the 2001 Commission communication on European Contract Law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission will carry out comprehensive monitoring in close collaboration with the private sector in order to ensure respect for the agreed standards.

<p>(EN) The Petition to which the honourable Member refers (N° 466/2001 Lambiris) concerns an individual case of a professional recognition procedure under Article 8 of Directive 93/16/EEC (Doctors Directive). This Article has been transposed in the United Kingdom by the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order 1995 (ESMQO): The relevant parts of Article 8 have been specifically referred to in Article 3(4)(i) and 3(4)(ii), which provides as much certainly as if the provisions of Article 8 were set out verbatim in the ESMQO. The Commission does not dispose of any elements that would allow it to conclude that the relevant Article of the Doctors Directive has not been fully and precisely implemented in the United Kingdom. The circumstances of the application for recognition made by Mr Lambiris have also been examined by the Commission. It has been concluded that the facts show that the Article 8 procedure has been correctly applied in this case.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member correctly states the Commission has not hesitated to initiate an infringement procedure in this context against Spain. The Court decided on 16 May 2002 that Spain had failed to transpose, within the prescribed time-limit, Article 8 of Council Directive 96/13/EEC.

<p>In the case of Latvia, the Commission co-operated very closely with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which had an office in Riga from 1993 until 2001, with a view to ensuring that the national legislation was brought into line with internationally accepted standards. Further, the successive governments in Latvia have been encouraged to, and now provide, support for granting of nationality status as well as for the integration of minority groups into society.</p>

The rules establish that the national terms and conditions of the country to which workers are posted are applicable. For self-employed workers operating in another Member State, there are no such provisions. People come to Sweden, for example, through international employment agencies to carry out projects in the building industry as self-employed workers. They declare that tax and social security contributions are paid in their own country, which is difficult to check in every single case. Such self-employed workers often charge a very low hourly rate. There is therefore reason to believe that at least some of them do not fulfil their obligations in their own countries. One of the consequences of this kind of arrangement is social dumping. Prices and wages are squeezed to levels which are substantially lower than they should be compared with pay and social security contributions under collective agreements.</p>

<p>(EN) The Posting of Workers Directive refers to a situation where an undertaking established in a Member State, within the framework of the provision of transnational services, posts its employees to carry out work temporarily in another Member State.</p>
<p>In essence the Directive defines a set of terms and conditions of employment of a host state which must be complied with by the undertakings that post workers.</p>
<p>Three different forms of postings are covered: postings based on a service contract, intra-company postings and finally postings by temporary employment undertakings or placement agencies. In all these cases there must be an employment relationship between the undertaking making the posting and the workers during the period of posting.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Directive applies to workers but not to self-employed persons. According to the Directive the definition of a worker is that which applies in the law of the Member State to whose territory the worker is posted. It is for the host state to control and verify whether a posted worker is a worker within the meaning of its legislation.</p>
<p>Supervising and monitoring the compliance with the terms and conditions of employment is a matter for the Member States. In order to facilitate effective monitoring in posting situations, the Directive obliges Member States to make provision for co-operation between the public authorities which are responsible for monitoring terms and conditions of employment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Union has granted support for the development of railway infrastructure in Greece under the Community Support Framework for the programming period, 1994-99. The results achieved will be set out in the final report for this programme, which is due to be forwarded to the Commission by the Greek Authorities as part of the programme closure procedures. The Commission will also receive similar information on rail projects supported by the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>The new Community Support Framework for Greece covering the period, 2000-2006, is intended to make a significant contribution to the establishment of an upgraded railway network by the end of 2008 between Patras, Athens, Thessalonika and the borders with Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Bulgaria. The Commission is working closely with the Greek authorities in an effort to ensure that this ambitious programme can be fully realised.</p>
<p>The Commission has carried out a control mission early this year at the level of the projects as well as an audit of the management systems and capacity of Ergose. The findings of the controls are currently under discussion with the Greek Authorities. Meanwhile, the findings of the audit will shortly be communicated to these authorities. The Commission will only be in a position to draw conclusions from these investigations when the discussions with the Greek Authorities are completed.</p>
<p>With regard to the level of payments made to projects in this field, the figures supplied in April 2002 in the answer to the honourable Member’s written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2002-0332_EN.html">E-0332/02</a><a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> are still valid. No payments have been made in the interim while a strategic plan for railway investment is being finalised in order to provide a solid basis for the further management of the projects concerned. The Greek Authorities have submitted a plan in draft form, which is currently being examined by the Commission. Payments will resume when this is finalised and when a clear timetable together with realistic costings for different elements of the investment programme have been put in place.</p>
<p>It is therefore premature at this stage to discuss matters such as the possible launching of a procedure by the Commission to recovery resources transferred to Greece for railway investment under the Structural Funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Such guiding principles should take into account existing Community initiatives and legislation and international agreed instruments such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises, International Labour Office (ILO) core labour conventions and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Indeed the growing number and diversity of guidelines, principles and codes, not comparable in scope, intent, implementation or applicability, reflects the richness of voluntary enterprise initiatives, which often include innovative elements, but do not answer the need for effective transparency about business CSR performance.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that convergence of CSR practices and instruments, based on European values, is desirable to further promote the development of CSR.</p>
<p>This convergence should build upon core European values and international agreed instruments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0776"></a>

<p>(EN) The law on the financial conditions of the religious and public activities of the churches was amended in November 2001. The modification of the law was supposed to enter into force in January 2003. The main element of the amendment concerned a change of the financing modalities of the churches.</p>
<p>The new financing modalities were based on the results of the 2001 census, which for the first time included a non mandatory question on church affiliation following a joint recommendation by the United Nations Economic and Social Committee and Eurostat for the forthcoming census world campaign.</p>
<p>The question on religion included in the 2001 census was responded by less some 9 million persons out of which 7,6 million claimed to belong to some 260 various churches/religions; these figures basically confirmed the previously estimated numbers.</p>
<p>Following the change of Government in 2002, it was decided to maintain the church financing regime of 1997, through an amendment annulling Article 153 adopted in 2001. This modification is supposed to enter into force in January 2003 after its adoption before the end of 2002.</p>
<p>Declaration 11 to the Amsterdam Treaty states that 'the Union respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious associations and communities in the Member States'. In the current Member States, a wide variety of different systems as regards the support for religious groups among the current Member States exists. It is up to each national administration to define the criteria for being recognised as a religious group and for being eligible to receive support from the state budget. It goes without saying that this freedom also applies to future Member States such as Hungary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as stated in the 2002 Regular Report on Hungary's progress towards accession, the 'freedom of religion is enshrined in the Hungarian Constitution and no particular problems have been reported in this respect'.</p>
<p>The criteria for membership agreed by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 include the guaranteeing of the rule of law. The Commission monitors respect of this commitment by all candidate countries and regularly reports to the Parliament and to the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0779"></a>

<p>(EN) The Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation (Minatom) is responsible for ensuring the safe collection, treatment and disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste arising from the decommissioning of the Russian nuclear submarine and the nuclear ice breaker fleet in North-West Russia. The international community, including the Union, attach great importance to the effective pursuit of these activities.</p>
<p>The recent Commission proposal to raise the borrowing ceiling would allow Euratom to grant loans targeted at improving the nuclear safety level of installations in operation or under construction or to assist in their decommissioning in Central and Eastern European countries, including Russia.</p>
<p>The Commission has played a very active role in launching the 'Northern Dimension Environmental Protection Fund' (NDEP). The Commission has pledged €50 million as a contribution to the fund, of which €40 million is for its 'nuclear window'. The main objective of the NDEP nuclear window is to assist the Russian Federation in the most urgent tasks relating to nuclear waste in NW Russia, including in particular those relating to the situation of the Northern Fleet and the quantity of spent fuel stored in the region, for example at Andreeva Bay.</p>
<p>The NDEP Steering Group (consisting of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Nordic Investment Bank, World Bank, European Commission and the Russian Federation) has identified 16 nuclear waste management projects on the Kola Peninsula with an estimated total cost of approximately € 500 million. The promoter of these projects is Minatom.</p>
<p>The Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) will set the legal framework addressing the most important legal questions associated with western assistance in the Russian Federation, in particular access to sites, tax exemption and liability. Its conclusion is a crucial precondition for initiating nuclear-related projects. The Commission, along with other Western Donors and Russia, has participated in the negotiations that it is hoped will lead to the signature of the MNEPR.</p>
<p>In addition, at the Kananaskis summit June 2002 the G8 launched a global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction including projects to address non-proliferation, disarmament, counter-terrorism and nuclear safety (including environmental) issues. The dismantlement of decommissioned nuclear submarines is a priority concern in this context and the G8 will commit itself to raise up to $20 billion to support such projects over the next ten years.</p>

<p>The United Nation’s plan for a settlement is a long and complex document, which seeks to bridge differences between the parties. The presentation of the plan was a courageous and important step which has the support of the Union.</p>
<p>In Seville, the European Council indicated that Cyprus would need to speak with one voice in the Union and ensure proper enforcement of Union law.</p>
<p>The initial assessment is that the institutional arrangements envisaged in the UN plan would broadly comply with the conditions set out in the conclusions of the Seville European Council, as confirmed in October 2002 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The UN has proposed that Cyprus request from the Union derogations from the acquis in order to guarantee the constitutionally enshrined bi-zonality, as expressed in the UN Security Council resolutions. There are precedents for certain derogations which, if acceptable to the parties directly concerned, could be accommodated in the framework of a comprehensive settlement.</p>
<p>At the recent European Council in Copenhagen the accession negotiations have been completed with Cyprus, which will be admitted as a new Member State to the Union. Nevertheless the European Council confirmed its strong preference for accession to the Union by a united Cyprus and welcomed the commitment of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to continue to negotiate with the objective of concluding a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem by 28 February 2003 on the basis of the United Nations Secretary General's proposals. The European Council considered that those proposals offer a unique opportunity to reach a settlement in the coming weeks and urged the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to seize this opportunity.</p>
<p>The Union also recalled its willingness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in the Treaty of Accession in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.

The Committee established under this Directive has proposed nuclide-specific reference concentrations to facilitate the implementation of this Directive. The reference value for U238 is 3.0 Becquerel/litre (equivalent to 240 microgramme/litre). It should be noted that this allows only for the radiological aspect of uranium ingestion and not for its chemical toxicity, which is not included in the current Directive.</p>

<p>(EN) The Stockholm European Council set an employment rate target of 50% for older workers for 2010. In addition, the Barcelona European Council called on Member States to take measures to progressively increase the average effective age at which people stop working by about 5 years by 2010. Achieving these targets will require determined efforts by Member States.</p>
<p>In response to these calls, the Commission is encouraging Member States to take policy measures for older workers within the framework of the European Employment Strategy. In line with the employment guidelines, Member States are devoting more resources to active ageing policies in employment and there is now certainly wider recognition that such policies are essential in facing the challenges of an ageing population. The Commission's assessment of the implementation of the employment guidelines shows that Member States have made some progress in developing active ageing measures, although only a few have developed comprehensive national strategies. So far, the Member States have tended to concentrate on benefit reforms, and have given less attention to improving the working capacity of older persons. More needs to be done to avoid too much reliance on early retirement. Candidate countries are fully associated with the Employment Strategy and will have to formally implement it on accession.</p>
<p>In the light of the revision of the European Employment Strategy an even greater priority will be attached to the policies on active ageing. Future employment guidelines could usefully focus on policies and practices enhancing working capacity and on creating the right working conditions for older workers. Efforts to enable and motivate older workers to continue to work longer should not rely merely on the removal of financial disincentives but should also be based on better access to training, upgrading skills in the workplace and making age-sensitive improvements in the working environment. Such efforts should aim to raise the quality of individual lives and at the same time, at societal level, contribute to more growth, lower dependency burdens and consequently contribute to the sustainability of pension and health care systems. The active support and contribution of the social partners is essential to maximise the impact of such measures.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission suggested that progress towards the target of increasing the effective age exit from the labour market should be assessed on the basis of a new structural indicator on 'effective average exit age'. The Commission will report on progress towards meeting the Stockholm target and the Barcelona goal before the Spring European Council 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0803"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission believes that the Union can and is making a very important contribution to the eradication and prevention of poverty and social exclusion. It is doing so through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on poverty and social exclusion which was established at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 in order to make a 'decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and social exclusion by 2010'. The key elements of the OMC are the setting of common objectives and guidelines, translating these into Member States' own policies through national action plans which contain clear objectives and targets for reducing poverty and social exclusion, establishing comparable indicators and benchmarks to measure progress, periodic monitoring, evaluation and peer review of national performance and policies and the promotion of mutual learning and the exchange of best practice.</p>
<p>Considerable progress has been made over the past two years in advancing all aspects of the OMC. All Member States submitted their first National Action Plans for social inclusion in 2001, which were examined first by the Commission and subsequently with Member States. A Joint Report on Social inclusion, setting out the conclusions of such examination was presented to the Laeken European Council in December 2001.</p>
<p>The next round of National Action Plans will be due in mid 2003. This will be a very important opportunity to consolidate and build on the achievements to date and to further intensify efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion. Assessing progress of the Union strategy will become more effective on the basis of a first commonly agreed set of social indicators, and of national targets to be set by each Member State in 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that if the OMC is to have the maximum impact then the objective of eradicating and preventing poverty and social exclusion can and should be mainstreamed across all levels of policy making - the European, national, regional and local levels - and across a broad range of policy domains including economic, employment and social policies. In this way the different levels of policy making will reinforce each other and the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and social exclusion will be fully taken into account. This would reinforce the integration of economic, employment and social policies and contribute to the reinvigoration of the European Social Model.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0804"></a>

One can therefore assume that as long as the major markets for minerals, i.e. construction, transport, steel and chemicals, do not pick up, the growth prospects for 2003 will remain rather moderate. The volume of sales of aggregates is even expected to decline. The metals mining sector may be the exception, as it is expected to increase its production. In terms of employment the difficult market conditions together with structural changes are likely to contribute to further decline in employment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0805"></a>

<p>(EN) With the euro area being one of the largest economies and an important international trading entity the euro has positioned itself as the second most important international currency behind the US dollar.</p>
<p>The Commission does not pursue the internationalisation of the euro as an independent policy goal. This implies that it does neither foster nor hinder the gradual evolution of the international role of the euro. The Commission regards this process, as well as that of other currencies, as being mainly determined by the decision of market participants in a context of increasing market integration and liberalisation at the international level. This view is shared by the Council and the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
<p>There is no Community competence in relation to pricing conventions in oil markets or tourism markets. In any particular agreement to trade oil, there is contractual freedom between buyer and seller such that a contract may be denominated in whichever currency the private parties deem appropriate. The acceptance in third countries of tourist expenditures in currencies other than the domestic legal tender is subject to sovereign legislation in those countries.</p>

<p>(EN) In the context of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, the Commission raised, in its note of May 2002 to the Spanish authorities, concerns on the question of possible salt wedge intrusions into the Ebro delta and requested information on the likely impact of abstraction from the river on the delta (in distance and in time) as well as on the salinity of groundwater resources. The Commission is currently evaluating the comprehensive documentation provided by the Spanish authorities as a response to this note. Given the comprehensive and detailed character of the documents, the Commission has in its evaluation not yet arrived at conclusions. However, the response does not refer to an increase in salinity of 20 to 50 % in the lower Ebro.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive was adopted on 23 October 2000 and entered into force on 22 December of that year. Specific obligations under the directive will start to become effective as from the end of 2003. With regards to the achievement of environmental objectives, the directive requires that all surface water bodies and all groundwater bodies have to achieve/maintain ‘good status’. Good status is defined as a rather limited deviation from ‘high status’; such high status corresponding to totally or nearly totally undisturbed conditions of a type-specific ecosystem. Good status is further elaborated in a comprehensive annex: on salinity, it is specified that salinity must not reach levels which do not ensure the functioning of the type specific ecosystem. (annex V; 1.2.1). In the specific context raised by the honourable Member, attention has to be paid to an adequate equilibrium between freshwater and salt water in the lower channel, taking into account the current water uses in the area, the ecological status and the inter-relation between surface water and groundwater.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0819"></a>

<p>Standard EN 1317, to which the honourable Member refers, was published by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) as a voluntary European standard in 1998. In principle, in accordance with directives 93/36 and 93/37, the contracting authorities should therefore refer to such standards in their invitations to tender.</p>

<p>In this regard, the Commission has received several complaints from certain people in the industry. These complaints are under investigation, with a view to ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market in this field.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a ‘harmonised’ standard is being drawn up on the Commission’s mandate under the directive on building products. This standard will essentially include the content of standard EN 1317 published in 1998, and will add an annex that will define the conditions for affixing EC markings to these products, in accordance with the directive on building products.

It can however partly be explained by the relatively high number of cases in young animals born between 1996 and 1998 reported in Spain last year. This age group of animals is now getting closer to the average age when the disease becomes clinical, which is 4-6 years, and consequently the number of reported cases is increasing.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Commission has already noted a shift in the age structure of positive cases towards older animals this year, which is a positive sign. This leads it to believe that the trend in the BSE incidence in Spain will reach its peak and start declining sometime next year, provided that the methods of detection remain the same. If new, more sensitive BSE tests become available, the Commission expects to see an increase in reported BSE cases in all Member States.</p>
<p>There is not much that Spain can do to immediately decrease the number of BSE cases being detected. The cases being reported now were infected more than three years ago and reflect the exposure of cattle to the BSE agent at that time. The effect of any measures put in place now will only be seen after 4-5 years. The current Community legislation, in particular the feed ban and the removal and destruction of specified risk material, should, if rigorously implemented, be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected. BSE cases will nevertheless continue to appear in Spain, as in other Member States, for a number of years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0829"></a>

<p>The EU has recognised the serious economic situation in the Dominican Republic and has taken action accordingly, including the grant of EUR 23 m for a rural development project. This project has been successful, and as a result the production of milk has increased considerably. However, the effects of the project have now been undermined by export subsidies for milk powder, since as a result of these subsidies, Arla (a Danish firm selling dairy products) can sell its milk powder at one third of the price of locally-produced milk. This competition has driven local farmers out of the market, to the extent that, according to local authorities, 20 000 milk producers have had to quit farming.</p>
<p>Is it correct that export subsidies amount to some DKR 5600 per tonne for skimmed milk, some DKR 8100 per tonne for whole milk and some DKR 13 000 per tonne for butter?</p>
<p>Could the Commission please comment on whether this information is correct? If so, will this practice be continued, or have any measures been taken to prevent the EU’s export subsidies from counteracting the interests of the EU’s development projects?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) According to the information available, although the Dominican Republic has developed its national milk production, it is not self-sufficient in milk production and needs imports in order to meet the needs of its population.</p>
<p>In 2000, 50% of these needs were met by imports. Without imports, the price would be significantly higher and milk products would not be within reach of large sections of the population.</p>
<p>The increase in national production demonstrates that the resources implemented by the Union within the framework of development projects have had positive results.</p>
<p>In fact, it is precisely in order to allow such progress that the Community had agreed to restrict its exports of powdered milk within the framework of a rectification, requested by the Dominican Republic, of the concessions made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>For exports within the framework of this system, the Commission decided to grant refunds lower than those granted for the export of powdered milk to any other destination in the world; 70% for skimmed milk powder and 85% for whole milk powder. This means that the amounts are considerably lower than those mentioned in the honourable Member’s oral question: DKK 3379 per tonne for skimmed milk powder and DKK 6502 per tonne for whole milk powder. Butter is not covered by the system and the Union’s exports do not exceed 150 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>In view of these considerations, the Commission does not accept the accuracy of the information suggesting that exports of European milk powder have had harmful effects for the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>In fact, in the frequent contacts held under the system agreed with the authorities of the Dominican Republic, the latter have never mentioned any negative effects on national milk production.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0831"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the article in the Pakistani paper 'The News' referred to by the honourable Member which claims that 'the European Commission viewed the EP resolution as a document totally impervious to the political expediencies of the international fight against terror.'</p>
<p>According to the article, the quote emanates from 'sources privy to the EU decision-making process'. Whichever these ‘sources’ might be, they are not the Commission itself. The Commission would therefore like to clarify that it does not agree with this comment, which it regards as an incorrect interpretation of its views by undisclosed, and thus unverifiable sources.</p>
<p>The Commission considers the Final Report as a thoroughly professional document accurately reflecting the findings of the Union Election Observation Mission which was conducted in full compliance with internationally accepted criteria used for election observation. The document raises a number of serious concerns on the election process in Pakistan and sets out useful recommendations on how to improve this process. The Commission is in the process of examining what concrete measures will be taken to follow up on the report’s findings.</p>
<p>The Election Observation Mission report has in the meantime been distributed to the Pakistan authorities and the Member States. It has also been published on the Commission website.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
