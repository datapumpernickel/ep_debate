<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Helmuth Markov (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, first of all I would – of course – like to thank most warmly all those who have worked with me on producing my report. I would particularly like to mention Mrs Pribaz; of course I would also like to thank the colleagues on my committee, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Development who have helped enrich this report with very constructive amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains initial suggestions as to how trade policies can and should be oriented in order to contribute to solving the problem of poverty. I am pleased that this text establishes very clearly that trade must proceed according to certain rules if it is to become a meaningful and effective instrument for combating poverty and developing prosperity. That is because trade, whether at a regional, national or international level, is not an end or value in itself, but rather a means of ensuring that people are provided with goods in order to satisfy their needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s world, provision for all people is not guaranteed, and the opportunities which trade brings are not divided fairly – neither geographically between States or regions, nor between individual actors in the market. One of the results of this unequal distribution is poverty, poverty which reproduces itself. This is a problem which exists above all in developing countries, but not only there. Evidently, the proverbial invisible hand of the market cannot even solve this problem within a developed economic area like the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The more that politics edges away from organising the economic order and leaves it to liberal market forces to do as they wish, the more the goals of social cohesion move further away – all the more so since at the same time social rights, democratic participation and environmental protection are ignored and regional and local conditions and particularities are not sufficiently taken into account. On a global level, where existing differences in development and distribution are much more fundamental and serious, this situation appears several times more intensified. If the present policy of urgent and speedy liberalisation under pressure continues, then the Millennium Goal of halving the number of starving people by 2015 cannot be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Politics has the task of creating basic conditions capable of producing social development that is peaceful, that avoids exclusion and that promotes prosperity. A policy that opens borders for the international market can be a part of this. Until now this has proven successful in countries where industrialisation could first of all take place under the protection of state measures, where an institutional framework was in place to regulate the distribution of social and economic wealth, where a sufficiently robust economic sector existed permitting flexible activity, and where the state was independent enough to support particular economic sectors against the opening up of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">A high level of foreign debt and dependence on credit considerably restrict this competitiveness. In countries where these conditions did not exist, however, accelerated liberalisation has led to deindustrialisation, destruction of the environment and increasing dependency and has worsened the poverty of the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only refer to just a few aspects of the report here. The chance to develop independently and to industrialise must be given to all countries, just as it was once given to today’s industrialised countries. This includes a country’s right to decide for itself when, how much and if at all it wants to open up its markets to goods and services. This is, by the way, already provided for in the rules of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the signing of the WTO agreements, the profits made by producers on the prices of raw and primary materials have continually sunk so low that in the South as well as the North more and more small and medium-sized firms will have to close. At the same time, the same rules mean that one-crop agriculture is promoted, which may bring enormous profits for agribusiness but which has disastrous consequences for the environment and for employment. This is an agriculture which ultimately destroys its own basis for existence. Instead of this, politics must do its utmost to ensure, through regulation as well as through financial support, that biological diversity is preserved by lasting forms of exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore it is highly doubtful whether essential public services can be provided purely on the basis of market-economy structures to a sufficient extent that it could be said that the basic right to a dignified life is fulfilled. Here it is a question of simple but necessary things like access to high-quality drinking water, health, care, education and training. In areas where conditions do permit the liberalisation of market sectors, care should be taken that in doing so, international standards on the protection of social security, jobs and the environment are respected and held to be binding.</p>
<p class="contents">These and many other important points are included in the report in front of you. I call upon the Commission and the Council to read the suggestions of this House and to take them into consideration when forming policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Markov’s contribution provides a wealth of information and policy prescriptions on how to tackle the crucial relationship between trade and poverty, both in our bilateral agreements and in multilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I share to a large extent the overall thrust of the report. As I have said on several occasions, I want to put trade at the service of development. Trade is the driver of economic growth and, in the right circumstances, it spreads prosperity, but it is not a panacea and does not automatically lead to poverty reduction. Trade liberalisation needs to be implemented gradually. It should take place within a stable and supportive domestic policy framework and, in some cases, will require flanking measures to help bring about the process of adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already doing a lot of what the report recommends we should do. I shall give a number of concrete examples. Firstly, in trade negotiations, including in the DDA and EPAs, and as recommended by the report, the EU respects the right of developing countries to liberalise progressively and to maintain flexibilities for their sensitive sectors. Within the DDA, the EU is keen to see countries contributing according to their capacities and levels of development. This lies behind the idea of special and differentiated treatment. We are responding favourably to LDCs’ and developing countries’ interests in services, including as regards Mode 4 and in the sectors they have requested. Also, under GATT, we respect the freedom of countries to decide whether, and to what extent, they open up their service sector. We have not made any service requests to LDCs. We have set up a scheme to support ACP sugar producers in adjusting to changes following our sugar reform, and we are conscious of the need to address preference erosion. We actively promote regional integration and South-South trade, which the report rightly recognises as key to development, especially for marginalised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond trade negotiations, in the area of building capacity, the EU – which is to say the Commission and Member States combined – provides more than 50% of the overall trade-related assistance funded worldwide. Commission-managed, trade-related assistance was around EUR 850 million a year in the period 2001-2004 and, on the basis of the pledge that President Barroso made at the last G8 Summit, this will rise to EUR 1 billion in 2007. We are actively engaged in the aid-for-trade debate taking place in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also a pioneer in carrying out trade sustainability impact assessments – SIAs – to assess the potential impact of trade liberalisation on all three pillars of sustainable development. Since 1999, we have carried out these assessments on all the EU’s major trade negotiations, identifying areas where flanking measures may be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the recommendations of the report on labour standards and social rights, although labour is regrettably not part of the DDA, all our recent trade, bilateral and regional agreements recognise and promote social rights, including gender equality, child labour, forced labour and freedom of association. Moreover, through GSP+, we provide special incentives for developing countries that respect core labour rights. DG Trade is also funding an ILO pilot project on decent work indicators to predict and monitor the impact of trade on decent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also pleased to see in the report a number of recommendations addressed to other players. The report calls on other developed countries and advanced developing countries to implement duty-free, quota-free schemes for LDCs, matching our own ‘Everything but Arms’. After agreeing on 97% coverage in Hong Kong, I would suggest, nonetheless, that the United States needs to engage fully on the implementation of that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls on other WTO members to match the EU’s move in Hong Kong on export subsidies and to eliminate all forms of export support, including export credits and food aid. The report recommends substantial reductions of domestic subsidies by developed countries and a solution for cotton – again, key areas where we expect the United States to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is an open dialogue between us, I should like to raise a couple of points where the Commission’s views differ from the report. Aid for trade is an essential complement, but in no way a substitute, for a development-friendly outcome in the main negotiating areas of the DDA. The biggest gains for developing countries lie in the market access component of the round and, in particular, in the South-South dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the risk of fraudulent distortion of ‘Everything but Arms’, we should, of course, remain vigilant on triangular trade but, to our knowledge, only one case of abuse has been reported.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the recommendation to exclude public services from negotiations, we do not consider it necessary to renegotiate the GATT to exclude public services. It is entirely up to WTO members to decide which sectors they wish to open. We have, for instance, made it clear that we do not wish to take additional commitments on health, education and audiovisual services.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again thank all those who have contributed to this report for their political support and guidance, and for the constructive criticism and concrete suggestions for action contained in it and others like it. I remain committed to informing Parliament regularly and to listening to your views on major trade and development matters, as I have done to date and will continue to do in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the last 10 years, the proportion of world trade represented by the poorest countries, trading mostly in low added value products – agricultural raw materials and extracted natural resources, has decreased.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to eradicate poverty, first of all, radical policy changes are needed in both industrialised and developing countries so that the structural causes of poverty are removed.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, it is not enough to put fair trade rules, bilateral and multilateral trade relations into practice and improve WTO rules, but we must also develop trade relations between developing countries, the South-South dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, economic development will have a decisive influence on the reduction of poverty, especially investment in small and medium business, which provides the local market in developing countries with goods and services and creates higher added value, and offers opportunities for world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">In our group we believe that the free and fair trade for which the EU strives is also contributing at present to reducing poverty in many regions of the world. There are instances of failure, of course, but they are primarily due to the failure to implement fair rules rather than to the trade <span class="italic">per se</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the overtones of the report drafted by Mr Markov appeared on first sight to be that free trade exacerbates poverty rather than reducing it. Our group rejected this position. However, after discussions and amendments to the report, it now sounds better, and, together with the proposed amendments that I believe will be adopted tomorrow, it will be acceptable to our group. It is also obvious that while trade is not the only way of reducing poverty, it can make a major contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to propose that we give free, and I repeat free, trade a chance, so that it can help to eliminate poverty. </p>
<p class="contents">In English, that is ‘let us establish free and fair trade to make poverty history’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No one can doubt that the development of international trade and the liberalisation of international trade have made a decisive contribution to reducing poverty and mitigating the inequalities between developed and developing countries. However, as Mr Mandelson quite rightly said, this is not a panacea. As the statistics from international organisations show, we need organised liberalisation, the liberalisation of international trade on the basis of rules and regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">As the recent World Bank study showed, the anarchic liberalisation of international trade has resulted in an increase in poverty and the deconstruction of the productive fabric in the poorest countries of Africa. The same is also happening inside the European Union: there are areas which have been hit by unemployment, deindustrialisation and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should, in my opinion, contribute to the democratisation and strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the reform of the World Trade Organisation for the benefit of the poorest countries. It should also support with consistency the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and contribute to the successful completion of the Doha Round negotiations within the framework of a balanced and mutually beneficial compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union should continue to implement the important 'Everything but Arms' initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The emergence of China and India on the global trading scene played a huge role in this feat and they continue to lead the developing world by example. But the challenge is far from over. Even today, 49% of the population in LDCs still live on less than a dollar a day. By 2015, 471 million of them will be living in extreme poverty. Trade liberalisation is vital if we are to lift these people out of devastating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">But trade is not a magic bullet. The critical challenge is how to promote poverty reduction in a newly-liberalised open economy. The majority of LDCs are still galloping in the dark in this regard. Free trade is not the same as <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span>. The fundamental priority must be for governments to implement macro-economic strategies that integrate trade in a way that effectively supports poverty reduction. We must help them to do this through increasing assistance and improving its effectiveness. This is not basic aid plunging the developing world into further debt: this is investment – investment in infrastructure, technology, human capital and the global trading system itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in return, we will enjoy greater openness and competitiveness and the LDCs will benefit from greater capital accumulation and technological progress. These will form the engine of growth. International trade will be the fuel for that engine, and together we can accelerate towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its themes have been those of free trade and fair trade. Those are the twin pillars that support our policy objectives. Whilst bilateral trade agreements have their place, it is multilateral trade negotiations in a multilateral framework for the international trading system that, in our view, are best able to bring equity and balance to the international trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Doha Development Agenda is so important. It has at its heart the ideal of free trade contributing to poverty reduction in the world. As somebody once said, the victory of ideals has to be organised and, as one of the speakers tonight said, we want to see an organised liberalisation of trade. We do not want to see a jungle in which the rules of that jungle operate to the detriment of developing countries and the poor in the world. That is what the Commission is pursuing on behalf of Member States and I strongly believe that this report will guide us in these continuing efforts to achieve trade justice in the world, which is why I welcome it so strongly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trade agreements among countries can ensure political stability and form a solid basis for more or less lasting diplomatic agreements. Increasingly, therefore, they are the main players in a world based essentially on economic principles. Trade thus provides an extremely important vehicle and opportunity for economic and social development, but it is also a weapon – largely in the hands of the developed countries – that needs to be used with care, since it can irreversibly determine the future of a country or a geographical area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore absolutely crucial for Western countries to make a conscious effort to ensure that current trade practices and new agreements help to narrow the gap between North and South, rather than widening it through procedures that take no account of national differences. While liberalisation is a global and now irreversible process that can bring well-being and wealth by creating new opportunities in developing countries, it must still be regulated according to the differing situations where it is to be carried out. It must also be backed up with specific measures to ensure that economic development keeps pace with, and does not outstrip, appropriate and necessary development in other basic sectors, such as health, education and social policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
