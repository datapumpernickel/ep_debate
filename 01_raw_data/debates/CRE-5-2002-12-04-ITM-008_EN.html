<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to say about today's report is this. One: the goal of the Lisbon strategy is to transform the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, an economy capable of bringing about permanent economic growth, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. Two: in order to do this, we need an economic, employment, education, research policy and social policy strategy developed jointly by the Member States, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Three: Europe is moving from a market economy towards a social market economy and is in the process of taking the next step and making the eco-social market economy the order of the day for the twenty-first century. As someone so nicely put it, the twenty-first century will be the century of Europe but only, I would add, if we want it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Four: assuming we really mean it, the Lisbon strategy and an eco-social market economy will allow us, at long last, to get past the received wisdom of capital versus labour, social policy versus economic policy, public versus private sector, Europe versus the Member States. Five: it would all be quite simple if we could agree on a few basic principles: that the economy creates labour, that everything labour creates is social and that social cohesion and environmental protection are mutually supportive for the purpose of sustainability. This all depends primarily on human rather than state resources, not on equality for all, but on competitive ideas that strengthen the continent of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Six: we should therefore emphasise that economic policy has not been communitised and lies primarily within the sphere of competence of the Member States and that, under Article 99, economic policy must be regarded, and coordinated by the Member States, as a matter of common interest. Seven: we therefore welcome, by way of conclusion, the overall approach of the Commission communication on streamlining the annual economic and employment policy coordination cycles. We need this coordination in order to achieve common objectives despite differing jurisdictions. But this coordination depends on the Member States’ doing their bit, on their passing fast, clear information to the Commission, on defining individual responsibilities within the overall concept – because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link – and on the euro zone becoming more aware of its responsibility within Europe. We make a huge point of this in paragraph 18 of the report by calling for the role of the social partners in implementing the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy, in other words the European social partnership, to be strengthened. We therefore call for a tripartite social summit to be set up, with the participation of the European Parliament. We have no time for legal wrangling between institutions; we need to foster this social dialogue jointly and involve organisations of social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Which is precisely why we are demanding more rights in fora and in this process, by which we mean more involvement and more right of involvement on the part of the European Parliament. We stress in point 8 of the report that anyone who wants to see this democratic involvement must be concerned that the new timetable for the guidelines package gives the European Parliament even less time than before to agree on its position.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that this process has been streamlined. We welcome the fact that the focus is on implementation. We welcome specific timing arrangements and we welcome the fact that a strategic, medium-term policy concept is being strengthened. If we ensure that life is breathed into this communication, then we shall be one step closer to the Lisbon strategy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, economic prospects are not at their best at the moment and the European Union has realised that it needs to coordinate economic policy and employment policy more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal on streamlining coordination cycles has attracted the interest of all the institutions and numerous discussions have been held at various levels, illustrating that this proposal is not merely a technical proposal, as it might appear at first sight; it is, of course, guided by important political objectives, such as efficiency and transparency in the application of the Lisbon agenda and the role of the European Employment Strategy which, after five years in practice, is now firmly established. May I make a point of thanking the rapporteur, Mr Karas, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Bullmann, on a job extremely well done. I shall confine my comments to a few basic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the report supports the focus on the medium term. This means that we need to be much more sparing when changing and revising the guidelines. The Commission will approve a package of guidelines in keeping with the new programme for the first time in April 2003, covering the three years up to 2006. We need to avoid any major changes in the guidelines before this mid-term review in 2006. We have proven that it is far better to keep to the guidelines and ensure they are applied than to constantly add new elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this medium-term focus will require greater discipline on the part of everyone involved: the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and all other interested parties. Of course, the Commission will review the employment recommendations for each individual country every year in order to ensure that they still reflect political developments in each Member State. May I remind you that the Treaty requires us to produce this annual report, which will take the form of application monitoring. That brings me to the second aspect, which is consistency and complementarity. It is vital that the two procedures complement each other if we are to achieve the maximum possible coordination between economic policy and employment policy. We had a fair degree of overlap in the past; on occasions, however, we also had contradictory approaches to the two strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a need to focus on application. Now that the employment strategy has been up and running for a number of years, we have identified the basic practical problems and the gap which often arises between submitting national action plans on employment and implementing them. I should like to stress in particular that this streamlining procedure should result in closer collaboration, not just between the various Councils – the Ecofin Council and the Council on Employment will need to find a clearer and more efficient way of working together – but also between the institutions of the European Union. I think that Parliament – and the entire procedure, of course – will benefit from this proposed streamlining of procedures, especially from more transparent information, with the main elements of the application of financial policies and employment policies being provided in a coordinated manner. May I remind you that, in the past, information on these two procedures often came in at different times, giving rise to a great deal of confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, streamlining means a better governance model for these procedures, which in turn means more efficient consultation with the European Parliament and greater involvement on the part of the social partners and civil society. The big issue as far as evaluating employment policies is concerned is that neither the social partners nor the national parliaments have been properly involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must say that this proposal respects the need for autonomous procedures, as required under the Treaty. In short, the economic guidelines provide an overall framework for economic policy but the employment strategy has the necessary degree of autonomy. I am delighted that Parliament supports this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">So what next? This entire procedure coincides with the review of the employment strategy. We shall be presenting an initial communication in January 2003 and both these documents, the communication on the revision of the employment strategy and the draft joint report, which we submitted a month ago, will be the two basic political papers and will need to be debated so that we can get to the spring Council and then start applying the new procedure with the guidelines. We have a long history of collaboration with the European Parliament on the employment strategy. I think that we now have an opportunity for even more efficient and substantial collaboration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has worked on this Commission proposal in a very focused manner, in a very focused and very concerted manner. We were quick and we agreed across the committee and party political divide, under Mr Karas's guidance, on what I think is a good position. And because we have worked in such a quick and concerted manner, we can formulate clear demands on exactly what sort of coordination is required.</p>
<p class="contents">First, at no time, not for a minute, not for a second, does anyone have any authority whatsoever to subordinate the social goals of Lisbon, the employment policy ambitions of the Lisbon agenda, to a one-dimensional interpretation of the internal market. This must be crystal clear and must be expressed in the procedures we choose. On the contrary, only if you take specific measures to promote social integration, only if you develop the full potential of people in Europe and get them into work, will you have any chance of putting Lisbon's demanding agenda into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I say that quite advisedly in the present debate on job market reforms and the reform of social security systems. Of course we need systems to be flexible and adaptable, but we also need them to be modern. And a modern system is a system that offers security, security for job seekers, job security, security in the event of illness, old age or disability. That is why economic reform is a means to an end when it comes to maintaining and renewing the European social model, not the other way round. If this is what we want, we have to put the objectives of competitiveness, social security and full employment on a par with each other. We have to find ways of linking these goals and making them mutually supportive. And if that is what we want, we must also make sure that the relevant Councils and Commission departments are involved on an equal footing and that no new hierarchies are created or old hierarchies reaffirmed. We shall be measuring you in your spring report, in your guideline package, on the basis of whether you meet these targets and do justice to what the streamlining concept promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we want to do justice to Lisbon and Gothenburg, we must stop beating about the environmental bush. We must use the full potential of environmental policy in order to make it work for qualifications and employment. Thirdly, as Mr Karas quite rightly points out in his report, economic policy is a matter of common interest which deserves to be coordinated. If we want to coordinate it, then we also need to pluck up the courage to talk about investments and about an offensive in this area in the face of around 8% unemployment and a growth rate of under 1%. Parliament will be involved in this discussion and we must secure our rightful place in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to economic and employment policy in the European Union, the hour of truth is drawing ever nearer. The demands and the objectives from Lisbon and Gothenburg must now become reality. Simplification is more important than streamlining. Increased participation, increased openness and increased transparency are important. For us Christian Democrats, it is also important to assert that we are in favour of a social, ecological and ethically based market economy in Europe. It must be people-friendly. It must be family-friendly. It must provide room for personal, responsible creativity and also for security and initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Open coordination does not stand for standardisation but instead allows Member States, within the framework of close co-operation, still to find the solutions which are best for each individual country. It is important that the environmental objective from Gothenburg be combined with the economic growth requirement and social cohesion to achieve the three dimensions. We regret that the Commission has not included this in its communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As Christian Democrats let us also emphasise that trust as well as ethical and moral values are fundamental to social and economic development. If the economy lacks trust and an ethical and moral base, it cannot be developed. The European Parliament must achieve greater participation without necessarily demanding the right to make decisions.

We have always taken the view that this will only work once all the political areas have been put on an equal footing and all the Councils are considered equal under a guiding General Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately it took the Lisbon process, some six years later, to grab this opportunity and I am delighted that we have now moved from theory into practice. Commissioner, we have great expectations of the Commission; we expect an agreement to be reached. Europe is sorely in need of one. And that applies not just to economic and employment policy; it also applies to social and environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is sorely in need of one because we cannot afford the luxury of uncoordinated policies. The Delors Commission concluded at one point that uncoordinated policies were costing us growth, which automatically means they are costing us jobs in the European Union. We are counting on an end to this situation and from that point of view this new paper really is most welcome. But it is only most welcome if it can rely on a more secure data situation than is presently the case and we can explain to our citizens that the coordination process is not just yet another euro-word or instrument which will not stand up in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">What do I mean by that? We need to be able to show that certain economic or employment or environmental policy decisions in one Member State also harm or benefit the national economy or the job market or the environment in another Member State and can halt, freeze or foster growth, and we need statistics that can provide us with the relevant data. Unfortunately, to the disappointment of European economic researchers, this is still not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a coordination profile and this profile may become clear in the question of how we bundle investments, investments in research and development for example, where Europe unfortunately still has a great deal of catching up to do. The main thing is that Parliament should be involved under an interinstitutional agreement, at the very latest by the time the Convention completes its reforms and the Treaty is amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This must be our starting point. Some good objectives were set out in Lisbon and Gothenburg, but there is a huge gap between what is said and what is done. The European Union is facing serious economic problems, its growth potential is slowing down, public and private investment is very weak and it is lacking skills. Neither the Stability and Growth Pact nor the monetary policy is dealing with these challenges. They are assigning everything to the Member States, and coordination cycles, which are designed to be the Member States’ area of discipline, cannot work if the Union also fails to adopt and implement common policies. There is no genuine European economic policy due to differences between the Member States. Coordination cycles do not examine economic relationships between countries. And we do not yet have a global approach to the European economy and the eurozone, considered in the context of globalisation. We do not yet have a policy on demand, networks or human capacities. The Union is still an area of regulatory and fiscal competition, where the very notion of social market economy is not accepted and will not be incorporated, in my view, in the future constitution, especially since there is still genuine aversion towards economic affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to institutional procedures. What the Commission is proposing to us is purely technocratic. I am in favour of merging different areas and setting up a cycle. I agree with the principle of streamlining. However, this will not remove the aforementioned political obstacles, hence my suggestions. First of all, the Treaties provide no solid basis for communitarisation of the economic policy. Our priority must therefore be to establish this basis in the Convention. Secondly, no reliable comparative statistical and analytical tool exists, particularly for social cohesion and sustainable development. As a priority, we must therefore provide the Union with investigative and analytical resources which are equal to its statements. Thirdly, the proposed procedures do not yet have any democratic value. We urgently need a broad public deliberation on the situations and options prior to the Commission’s package, as well as a subsequent evaluation, by civil society and the elected representatives, and not only by the Commission. Fourthly, I do not believe that the European Parliament is today still capable of properly debating and of choosing a coherent economic policy. Too many positions held are marked by national interests alone and ideological mindsets. Having said that, Parliament is better placed than the Council and the Commission to deliberate and assess the economic policy. An annual interactive discussion is therefore necessary between national communities and the Community institutions at Parliament’s initiative. Only then will the Commission draft its proposals, only then will the decision be referred back to the Council, but Parliament could then have a power of ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, without shared political will and a common democratic procedure, the coordination of national policies will fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just like Mr Karas and Mr Bullman, I am quite disappointed that the Commission once again has managed to forget the decisions made at the Gothenburg Summit in which the environment was also to form an aspect of the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I think that it is good that the rapporteur is encouraging the Commission and the Council to add sustainable development to the rationalisation of political coordination, it can be done considerably earlier than the Commission is doing. The fact is that, besides failing to reinforce the Lisbon objectives with an environmental objective, there are also still many issues which remain to be resolved. We have discussed fisheries policy practically all night, but this also concerns an overhaul of agricultural policy, an area where we have to tackle the subsidies which we know to be damaging. We must also make sure that the environmentally harmful subsidies are abolished. This is included in the concept of ‘sustainable development’, but the Commission does not really seem to have accepted this or thought it through yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal for the spring summit next year must be to create balance in the measures between all three parts of the Lisbon agenda, above all by developing the environmental dimension and continuing to strengthen and make concrete the concept of sustainable development within all three dimensions of the agenda. The Commission must do this in a much more focused way. Above all, it must be ensured that the environmental indicators are taken seriously, which will in fact not be discussed until a few days before the Council is to reach a decision on this. All the work on sustainable development in this agenda has completely the wrong focus and is going far too slowly on the part of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is being discussed is coordination of the economic guidelines and employment guidelines. We are agreed, however, that the concept must be expanded. We need an environmental process and, especially, we also need a social process as an important part of the total process which was developed from the Lisbon Summit. These four parts, which are each of independent importance, must be coordinated. Otherwise, we will see an imbalance, changing the character of employment policy, for it will then no longer be determined by the link to the social perspective but will easily become a structural policy which means that employment policy will become a kind of reflection or mirror image – or an appendage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incredibly important to talk about social integration, work for all, good quality work. Many of these things are usually carried forward by the Commission. I sometimes wonder whether the Commission is speaking with a forked tongue, for it often emphasises the importance of good social goals of this kind, but at the same time these views are missing from this particular communication. I think this is so serious that I would like to formulate a kind of warning. If it should be the case that this is not just a coincidence but a trend, the balance and the harmony which seemed to follow from the Lisbon decisions will be replaced by conflict on the labour market and what we used to call class struggle. We are already seeing such trends today on Europe's labour market and these will become even clearer in the future. If we have this type of conflict to fight against, I believe that this is almost the worst thing that can happen for economic development in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to add something which has to do with synchronisation and coordination. A kind of horizontal coordination of the economy and employment at European level is now being discussed. I think that, here too, we must talk about social and environmental issues. At the same time, there is vertical coordination between levels. The biggest problem of all which we face, and which even the Commissioner, for example, knows that I always return to, is that it makes no difference how much we coordinate at European level if we do not achieve better co-ordination between European level and national level and as long as the national labour markets are not sufficiently open. I would like to emphasise this particularly, as it is sometimes said rather vaguely that the national parliaments have to be given a greater place. However we must be clearer and talk about how this is to be achieved. My answer is always that responsibility must be given to the national parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has had a very challenging task to streamline the measures of coordination. I fully welcome the efforts of the Commission in this respect and I want to thank our Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, for your courage in proposing these items.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to be the black sheep of the House today, but I think that we should also be critical when it comes to expanding methods of open coordination to different areas. In the report, Parliament says that we have two items which are important. If you look at paragraph (e) in the Karas report – I will read an extract from the paragraph: ‘Whereas a better streamlined review of implementation in the form of a new implementation package requires information on the implementation of policies agreed on Europe leading to an evaluation of implementation in the relevant policy areas’. This is a text from the report and it shows that, for Parliament, implementation of present coordination mechanisms is really important. We have not seen enough concrete results from the coordination mechanisms and we need concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">The other worry of Parliament concerns the role of Parliament and you can see from all of the reports that our role as a parliament, as a representative of the citizens, is very worrying for us. In the working group of economic governors in the Convention of which I was a member, we had a majority of members who thought that the European Parliament and the European Commission should have a role to play and that the methods of open coordination and processes should be included in the Constitutional Treaty. Unfortunately, I was in the minority in this working group, because I think that the main aim of the open method of coordination is to be flexible, and that it should not be in the Treaty. We should use the current mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practice, this will allow us to discharge our responsibility towards future generations and the countries whose development is lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus briefly on the instruments necessary for the practical implementation of this strategy. If we genuinely adopt the approach that quality of social conditions and of the environment are central rather than secondary to growth and that is an essential factor in competitiveness, the most appropriate implementation instrument would appear to be the method of open coordination, although it does need to be strengthened and streamlined, as the report states, particularly as regards the involvement of the European Parliament, which, moreover, needs to be better, much better equipped in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of such a policy depends on the genuine participation of all the institutional levels and all the social players. Without this widespread committed involvement, development will not be sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to sound the alarm, and in this I am supported, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, by the Civil Society Contact Group. The preliminary draft Constitutional Treaty presented by the Chairman of the Convention does not contain any reference to the concept of sustainable development. If we do not reinvigorate what has already been affirmed by the Treaty and at Gothenburg, it will be a genuine cultural regression, a step backwards which, not least, will reduce Europe’s influence as a global player. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not just about evaluating whether the objectives have been implemented; measures will also need to be corrected and new elements introduced. For example, the Council has decided to add a third dimension to the economic and employment policy dimensions: the ecological dimension, as a number of my honourable friends have already mentioned. I totally fail to understand why the Commission refuses to include ecological objectives. We have discussed the possibility of a new edition of the Stability Pact in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. My group, the PPE-DE, is against watering it down because that would undermine the stability of the euro and make people anxious. I think that greater involvement of the social partners in a tripartite social summit and a strengthened macroeconomic dialogue are noteworthy ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there are three important points in Othmar Karas’s excellent report. First, we need better coordination of economic policy, employment policy and social integration. The annual guidelines are the main tool for coordinating employment policy. It is a shame that numerous Member States agree on the objectives but then fail to put them into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament needs to be comprehensively involved in preparations for the spring summit. That means having enough time in the run up to the summit to examine the Commission’s proposal. We really must be allowed enough time. We expect the Convention to further strengthen our position as representatives of the people and the EU Treaty is to be amended to give us more codecision rights at all stages of the coordination process.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the future EU Member States: we need to integrate candidate countries at the very earliest opportunity if we want to achieve our ambitious aim of transforming the European Union into the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world within eight years. We call on the Commission to ensure the relevant departments in these countries are involved in a technically – and more important – logistically efficient manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
