We deeply regret the deaths of so many young people and we send our condolences to their families.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret even more that these young people lost their lives serving an occupation – I refer to Iraq – as the result of the unprovoked, illegal, barbaric invasion by the American and English imperialists, with thousands of victims and massive destruction. Fortunately, the just resistance of the repressed Iraqi people is developing against this occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Government alone, which has hastened to help the invaders by taking part in the occupation, is solely responsible for the unjust and inglorious loss of the Italian soldiers and policemen and it must answer to the innocent victims' families. At the same time, we cannot fail to observe that the European Parliament has not demonstrated the same sensitivity to the thousands of Iraqis who have died as victims of this barbaric invasion or to the victims of the imperialist interventions in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan or to the victims of Sharon's barbarity in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the only real way of honouring the dead is to immediately withdraw the occupying forces from Iraq and to prevent any other military intervention in the internal affairs of states in order to stop further bloodshed and this crime against humanity.</p>

This situation is one which has been repeated many times over in relation to other human rights activists.</p>

Mr Prodi has issued a political manifesto, in which he has outlined the strategy and necessities that the Left needs to embrace in order to secure an election victory in Italy. We take the view that the President of the Commission must maintain a certain political neutrality, that he must be above party-political wrangling. It is now clear that he no longer does that. The Eurostat scandal would have been a good opportunity for Mr Prodi to take his political responsibility and to step aside. The publication of this political manifesto is going too far. He should shoulder his responsibility: either remain President of the European Commission and concentrate fully on that task, or else conduct a political campaign in Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This war on drugs, however, also has a flip side. During my visit to Dutch prisoners there last week, including Machiel Kuyt, I saw the abject conditions under which she, along with other Europeans, is being held, and how, consequently, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Thailand has been party since 1997, is being violated. Extremely long detentions due to a shortage of judges and overfull prisons illustrate this point. Two things need to happen in order for this situation to change.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in the framework of the country strategy paper on Thailand dating back to May 2002, the European Union should turn its attention to legal aid, so that the seriously overtaxed legal system is relieved and the rights of the suspects are better respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Union should urge its Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with Thailand, which enables the transfer of prisoners. These agreements already exist with a number of countries, such as Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, and certainly also with my own country, the Netherlands; other countries should also conclude them, and Thailand is very much in favour of them doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Supermarkets too are being threatened if they want to buy meat from Spain and the Netherlands, and the French Government is refusing to take action. Although it is the insurers that compensate the direct damage, the damage incurred in the long term, because the meat is no longer bought for fear of threats from a few gangs of thuggish Breton farmers, is a thorn in my side. It is also in contravention of the internal market and the free movement of goods. I therefore ask you to urge the Commission and the French Government to put a stop to this as soon as possible, because if it is not, French wine and champagne may well similarly be rejected in other European countries. This would not benefit the internal market and would even spoil our Christmas to some extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to remember, in particular, the 19 Italian victims of the massacres in Nasiriya. It is important that the President of Parliament expresses our sympathy for the victims and our condolences to their families tomorrow, but I feel that it is also appropriate to thank all the armed forces of all the European countries who are currently on peace missions throughout the world. Lastly, I hope that Parliament will make a firm commitment to implementing increasingly effective measures to combat terrorism, for the message which must be sent out by the European Parliament is that none of the European peoples are going to let themselves be intimidated by these cowardly attacks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europeans are deeply unhappy at the prospect of military commissions imposing the death penalty or unlimited detention for the Guantanamo Bay detainees, and at the way the US is trying to sabotage the International Criminal Court.

It is all the more alarming if the holders of the rights themselves abuse the rights to the disadvantage of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that this is what is being done now in Scotland by Diageo, the multinational spirit drinks producer, which produces Cardhu whisky. The supply of Cardhu single malt has run low. However, now Diageo is producing something called Cardhu pure malt whisky. Not all Members of this House may be aware of it, but there is a very big difference between pure malt whisky – which is a blend of various malts – and single malt, which comes from a single malt distillery. It is vital to the health of this Scottish and European industry that consumer trust is maintained and that sharp practice by producers is eliminated as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This industry has often sought and obtained the support of the European authorities. We should insist that they themselves play the game. Mr President, please write to the chief executive and get Diageo to stop this! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not going to speak about Mr Milosevic now, since I have done so on a number of occasions in the past. I should like instead to refer to the fact that the demonstrators in The Hague, most of them Serb immigrants, were not allowed to write slogans in their own language. Speaking to the police I found out that there is a general rule against slogans written in languages that the police do not understand. This is apparently so that the police can control their content.</p>

The staff insisted that I take off my jacket, although I had removed from it all metal objects and had gone through the metal detector.

I also see the presumption of guilt of terrorism for any person going through a security check.

<p class="contents">The accident happened in July 2003, 4-5 months ago, while the <span class="italic">Tasman Spirit </span>was being piloted by a Pakistani pilot in the port of Karachi.

<p class="contents">As we speak, both the ship's crew and those who went to clean up the area are being held hostage by Pakistan without charges and, apart from the fact that they have not released them, this is preventing the companies which have undertaken the clean-up operation from going there, because they are frightened that perhaps they too will end up as hostages.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, the ship was insured. The Pakistani Government may have differences with the insurance company. However, under no circumstances can the seamen, especially those who arrived well after the event in order to help clean up the environment, be held as hostages as a negotiating element between the Pakistani authorities and the insurance company.</p>

The USSR would never have left these countries if it had not been forced to do so by the economic collapse of the Communist system.</p>

I should like to ask you to allow me to inform the House about a number of serious infringements which I noticed during my recent visit to Estonia and Lithuania.</p>
<p class="contents">In Estonia, as in Latvia, although half the population is Russian or Russian-speaking, the Russian language is not recognised as an official language. Public-sector services, courts and laws are all in a language of which they have an inadequate command. In addition, they are denied the nationality of the country in which they and their fathers were born. They are made to sit humiliating and highly specialised examinations in language, the constitution and history, which very few are able to pass. The universities and schools are closed to Russian. In all three Baltic States, the communist parties are banned and their cadres persecuted. In Lithuania, the leaders of the Communist Party of Lithuania, Mikolas Burakevicius and Koulalis, have been in prison for ten years on prefabricated charges under a law passed long after they were arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">This and much more goes on in the Baltic and in other former socialist accession countries, despite assurances to the contrary by Mr Verheugen, who has repeatedly expressed his support for these flagrant violations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to a letter containing specific facts …</p>

This is extremely odd. It is, in the first place, all very well for people to travel to The Hague especially to demonstrate in favour of a totalitarian dictator, but then, on top of that, they refuse to write the placards in a language that is intelligible to Dutch people.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the reason for that? It is very obvious. If they are written in a non-intelligible language, they may contain all kinds of racist messages. If they are accepted after all, then the next thing is, the newspapers carry photographs that give the impression that the Dutch police is standing by while these awful things are being written. It is therefore entirely logical that a request is made beforehand to draft the messages in an intelligible language so that the Dutch police can ensure that the placards themselves do not infringe the law. If that is seen to be a police state, then that is taking matters very far indeed and is clearly indicative of what those who are behind Milosevic think a police state is like. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ryanair has helped to reverse air price arrangements in Europe; it has secured favourable deals from private airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely in this era of competition we should permit public airports to compete with private airports for the generation of air travel business, because at the end of the day it will mean cheaper air prices for consumers. This in turn will send out a positive message from the European Union that it is actually supporting measures which promote air travel at a competitive price and help the consumers of Europe.</p>
