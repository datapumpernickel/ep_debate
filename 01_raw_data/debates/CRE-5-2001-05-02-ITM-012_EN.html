<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cederschiöld (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we are now to deal with the issue of synthetic drugs. Europe is a world leader in the manufacture of synthetic drugs. That is not a fact to be too proud of. Large quantities of LSD, amphetamines, ecstasy and other synthetic drugs are produced every day in Europe, either for domestic consumption or for export to third countries. This large-scale and often organised production is a blot on Europe’s copybook and undermines our credibility in the international struggle against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative against synthetic drugs ought therefore to be warmly welcomed. The proposal is based upon a highly developed method of analysis applied by certain laboratories. Synthetic drugs have certain features in common because of the process and methods by which they are produced. Links can therefore be made between synthetic drugs confiscated on different occasions in different places. Such information enables the police more easily to identify illegal centres or networks manufacturing drugs. The method provides the police and judiciary with an excellent tool for isolating narcotics factories.</p>
<p class="contents">The first decision is about setting up the system of special forensic profiling analysis. The Member States are obliged to send samples of certain drugs that have been confiscated to particular laboratories. At present, such laboratories unfortunately exist only in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. The idea is that, as soon as a laboratory in a Member State has the required competence, this laboratory will become part of the network. In that way, the relevant skills will be extended throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second decision concerns the actual transmission of samples of controlled narcotic substances. The Member States are obliged to allow these to pass through their territory. They must be sent in a way that guarantees the greatest possible security so as to ensure that the transported samples are not misused. It should also be emphasised that we are talking in terms of <span class="italic">milligrams</span>, that is to say <span class="italic">extremely</span> small quantities which can scarcely be misused because they are so incredibly small.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be emphasised that the initiative affects only the fight against the large-scale organised production of synthetic drugs, something that is prohibited throughout the EU. It therefore has nothing at all to do with the sensitive debate about what should be readily available on the street, for personal use etc. The present debate has nothing at all to do with that. Instead, we are concerned here with the organised production of synthetic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be underlined that the system proposed is not definitive. It is not perfect in every respect. I know that. It would be preferable if every country had its own laboratory for forensic profiling analysis but, because the technique has so far only been developed in a small number of countries, that is not the case as matters stand. At the same time, it would nonetheless be a great pity not to make use of the opportunity of getting our hands on those production units that exist within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the actual transmission system, I take the point also touched upon by certain countries such as France and, especially, Spain, to the effect that it would be good if these samples could be transmitted electronically. I completely share that view. The report also states that the method of transport must be continually reviewed. In my opinion, it would be completely wrong, however, to use such arguments to prevent the system from being introduced right now. This Parliament will certainly have an extremely important role to play when it comes to pushing the issue of electronic transmission, but I really do hope that Spain will not use this as an argument for stopping the transmissions. That would be deeply regrettable. Fortunately, the committee realised this and adopted the report unanimously. I am sorry that there are some countries in the Council which have not realised that it is just as well to get started now, for they are in fact slowing down the fight against crime. As I see it, it is downright irresponsible to weaken the fight against organised crime, just because we do not have the perfect system. It is the same argument we heard just now when we discussed transparency and public access to documents and when Sweden offered Europe a compromise. There is now every reason for us to join together in offering just such a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that both Parliament and the Council will support this initiative, and I want to thank young Nils Hänninger at the Ministry of Justice in Sweden who has driven this idea forward. I also want to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this decision, which may well be the first binding decision in the area of drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen still present, looking at the Chamber, one might well imagine that drugs pose no problem to Europe and no problem whatsoever to its young people. But, unfortunately, they are a problem, and not just any problem; the truth is they are <span class="italic">the </span>problem. The huge increase in the use of drugs is threatening to destroy part of today’s generation and hence part of our society, while organised crime is threatening to undermine it.</p>
<p class="contents">Drugs help a mere handful of people make a great deal of money in the organised crime sector; but they destroy countless lives and existences. I can back up what I have just said with a few figures provided by Europol and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon. It is estimated that some 8,000 tonnes of cannabis and derivatives, 350 tonnes of cocaine, 60 tonnes of heroin and at least 50 million ecstasy tablets reach the European market every year. These are the latest figures available. And all of these drugs are taken, by more and more youngsters. If I tell you that investigations have proven that some 20% of young people have already used cannabis at least once and that an estimated 5 million young people take synthetic drugs, it should be enough to start alarm bells ringing.</p>
<p class="contents">The producers and traffickers who deal in these drugs are part of organised crime. They ply their trade at the expense of young people, which is why we must do everything we can to combat this crime – which, as I said, is part of organised crime – in the Union and internationally with representatives from other countries in the world which are equally affected. I therefore welcome the Swedish initiative because it takes a step forward here. It is another piece in the puzzle of instruments which we need if we are to be able to make any headway.</p>
<p class="contents">The first initiative on the transmission of drugs for the purpose of analysis and testing is designed to avoid abuse as the result of larger consignments and is a perfect instrument in the fight against drugs. Secondly, I think it is most important that analyses be used to check the origin of synthetic drugs. Both instruments are essential in the fight against drugs and organised crime. What we need to do is to extend the network of suitably standardised, quality laboratories. However, this alone would still be too little; we must have cooperation with Europol, which is working on the same agenda and keeps a list of synthetic drugs and similar products used for ecstasy and other amphetamines which are available on the market. This means that there will be no loose cannon or parallel work and that work will be carried out in cooperation with Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point which I think is extremely important is that, although the European Union is now an export market for synthetic drugs and candidate countries are buying from it, having become transit countries and countries of destination, we need to make all the instruments at our disposal immediately available to the candidate countries so that we can create a larger area of security, which is our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective, and I know that it is an ambitious objective, is to achieve a drugs-free society. It will be no easy task but these measures certainly take us a step closer to this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Drugs cause harm when they are abused. However, I see this rather as a social problem, with drugs acting more as a catalyst, which is why I think that fighting the drugs is not really doing anyone a service.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the best solution is to allow people to decide the quantity of drugs which they want or do not want to take for themselves. I therefore think that this initiative will not be much help. In the final analysis, it is just more repression, more powers for Europol, which does very little to help us live our lives as we so choose. There is an alternative to this proposal in the form of drug checking. Various highly successful drug checking projects have been carried out in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Vienna and Germany. The European Drugs Monitoring Centre in Portugal has given drug checking a very good report and it continues to be active in this area. That is why I think that we should not agree to this repressive measure. In all events, we the Greens shall not do so; instead we shall back the right of the people who wish to consume these substances to decide for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that is exactly where the problem lies. Setting up laboratories presupposes that the criteria are sufficiently clear and the procedures transparent. However, it appears that there are many unanswered questions surrounding the method, the results of which are said to lead to different validations in different countries. The Swedish proposals seem to want to hide the fact that Sweden itself needs a few years yet in order to fully develop its own capacities, but it wants to get the ball rolling at this stage nevertheless. At the moment, we are still waiting for the recommendation of the experts from most central laboratories, but we will not receive it before the end of the Swedish Presidency. Not everyone in my group will agree with me that this is potentially a sound proposal and that, in time, such a set of instruments could be really useful, whichever way the drugs issue is addressed in future. However, it is extremely regrettable that the diligence which Sweden has displayed in this matter is particularly ahead of its time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes Parliament's proposed resolution and supports the objectives of these two Swedish initiatives establishing a system of special forensic profiling analysis of synthetic drugs and on the transmission of samples of illegal narcotic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been working in this area for some time. In particular it has supported research into the development of a harmonised method for the profiling of amphetamines. This research project is due to be completed in February 2002 and we hope that its results will be taken into account in future work in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the Swedish initiatives is in line with point 4.1.1.4 of the European Union action plan on drugs 2000-2004 which was endorsed at the Feira European Council of June 2000 and so represents a priority for the European Union in the fight against drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also working actively on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs. In the coming weeks, we intend to publish two important texts: first, the Commission will present a communication to Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the action plan, and secondly the Commission will bring forward proposals for a framework decision establishing minimum rules on drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of synthetic drugs, as mentioned by several Members, is of particular importance at the moment, both for the European Union and internationally. The Commission intends to launch this year a review of the joint action on new synthetic drugs of June 1997, which allows new synthetic drugs to be controlled throughout the European Union and to be made subject to criminal penalties. The Commission recently brought forward proposals to monitor informally the non-controlled chemical precursors of synthetic drugs and this is currently being considered by the Council and Parliament. We have also presented a resolution to the Commission on narcotic drugs in March 2001 addressing the problem of the diversion of precursors for synthetic drugs and this proposal attracted wide support. We have also been active in a meeting in December 2000 on synthetic drugs organised by Japan within the G8 framework. All these elements show how important this debate is at world scale. Therefore, I would like to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld for her excellent report and join her in my appeal to pass over what I consider minor difficulties in order to have a quick approval of these two Swedish initiatives by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
