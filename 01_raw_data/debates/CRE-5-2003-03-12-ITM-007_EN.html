I hope that she will be appearing any moment now. In my own-initiative report on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I have dealt with gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament both at political and administrative level. We have held discussions on this in my committee with stakeholders, we have had a series of discussions both with the President and with the Secretary-General, followed by a public hearing, and we have also held discussions with staff representatives and with the advisory committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's obligation to promote equality between men and women is rooted in Articles 2, 3 and 13 of the EC Treaty and in Article 23 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. Gender mainstreaming as a political strategy is intended to assist in achieving this ambitious objective. This also follows on from the definition of the Beijing Platform for Action, under which gender mainstreaming is intended to further the development, organisation and evaluation of political measures and decision-making processes so that the initial position and the impact on men and women is taken into consideration in all areas of policy and at all levels, with a view to working towards the objective of genuine equality for men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must act as a motor for equal opportunities, as it has indeed repeatedly done in the past, and gender mainstreaming now needs to be incorporated into our political activities and our structures in a coherent and comprehensive way. This report accordingly proposes a whole raft of measures intended to underpin the principle of gender mainstreaming in the long term. Strengthening the position of women is therefore a key aspect, but not the only one, the aim being to adopt a double approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose a number of measures in the report. The European Union needs to lead the way, and Parliament should signal its active commitment by setting up a High-Level Group on Gender Equality, chaired by its President, just as happened at the Commission under President Santer. We are definitely lagging somewhat behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conference of Committee Chairs needs to be involved here and, in conjunction with the Committee of Delegation Chairs, it should make recommendations to the Conference of Presidents as to how to implement gender mainstreaming in the committees' and delegations' work in a concrete way. Our proposal here is that one member, preferably the Chair or a Vice-Chair, should be made responsible for gender mainstreaming and that the individual committees should then identify projects in their respective work programmes to ascertain how gender mainstreaming can be achieved in their area of activity and systematically check the impact of measures affecting women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, planning and implementation, and also evaluation, need to be oriented towards achieving a defined quality standard and facilitating internal benchmarking. Each committee should then carry out an annual assessment of its activities and achievements in the field of gender mainstreaming on the basis of predetermined targets and should monitor these measures. We propose that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should then draw the individual reports together into an annual report on gender mainstreaming and make recommendations for further steps. A further package of measures concerning agreement on how to reconcile staff members' professional and family activities is then needed. One important target is the use of gender-neutral language.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective, particularly bearing in mind enlargement, must be to involve the candidate countries in this process, and with an eye to the elections to Parliament in 2004 to ensure that equal representation of men and women can be achieved. The situation as it stands is that although Parliament has always been in the vanguard in this respect, the proportion of women Members was 17.5% in 1979, and this has now risen to 31%. However, in the Convention, there has been a step backwards. I believe that it is highly important that we should give a positive political signal by implementing benchmarking and gender mainstreaming, so that the 2004 elections will represent an advance – and not a retrograde step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have issued a favourable opinion, though we have highlighted certain points, because the objective of gender equality, as laid down in the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, is an important objective that Parliament does well to debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainstreaming equality, as Mrs Gröner has said, means intervening in the fields of decision-making, political and administrative processes, encouraging the making of decisions that take into account the goals we must achieve. Therefore, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities proposes that Parliament should adopt a plan of action alongside measures which, of course, are provided for in the legislation and are aimed at reaching the objectives we wish to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is a process which has ramifications in our social structures and in the institutions and which, naturally, must see effective equality as the conquest of substantive equality of fundamental rights and duties in an open, globalised society that wants to give due importance to all cultural expressions. I believe expressions of equality have a profoundly cultural content.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fundamental that there should be a high-level policy group to restore the gender balance in Parliament’s governing bodies and in Parliament as a whole, especially in view of enlargement, which must take into account the goals we wish to achieve. Therefore, the opinion that the Committee on Legal Affairs has drawn up and which I want to convey to this House, here this evening, points out that we have referred to the 2002 Lalumière report, approved by the Bureau. That report not only provides for the appointment of a higher percentage of women at A1 and A3 levels in the next few years, but it also states that, in terms of career development, the principle of priority should be applied systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">This principle, however, has been considered by the Committee on Legal Affairs to be in some ways a little excessive, going rather beyond the goals we want to achieve, because it is at variance with the case-law – which I believe is quite enlightened – of the Court, which naturally considers that it is against national rules to automatically give priority where candidates of different sexes short-listed for promotion are equally qualified. Such a priority should, of course, be seriously taken into account initially in the context of competitions for posts, but it must not constrain the actual outcome in practice. In other words, giving absolute and unconditional priority to the under-represented gender for appointment or promotion is, according to the Court’s ruling, not only going beyond the objective of promoting equal opportunities but also replacing this objective with an outcome of equal representation, which can only be achieved if this objective is fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that this philosophy of the Court and this fundamental principle, which, with some moderation, brings a substantive balance to decision-making, should be adopted as appropriate instruments that Parliament must adopt in order to achieve a more mature equality, which would be a victory in the process of social and cultural life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report lists our entire <span class="italic">acquis</span>, everything we have applied and adopted in the European Parliament to date, such as the report by Mrs Lalumière. It also includes the European Commission’s good practices in promoting mainstreaming in its staffing policy. The most important aspect of this report is that it highlights the need for political will at all decision-making levels, in the administrative structure, in the Bureau, in the Conference of Presidents and in the functioning of the political groups, if we are to achieve better results in gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that gender equality needs to be entered on the agenda of all the institutions, because that is the only way the under-representation of women and the equality deficit will receive proper notice. The report contains interesting proposals for a social infrastructure, such as childcare facilities for members’ and employees’ children, which we feel is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>, together with other proposals relating to the presence of women and the impact this will have at all levels and on all policies applied in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an own-initiative report which does not impose a policy or commit us to specific measures. Nonetheless, we trust that it will provide ample opportunity for thought and will inspire us to adopt measures, now that the European Parliament is preparing to enlarge and to welcome representatives from the new Member States. We must not simply present the best possible image; we must also set an example for the new countries, without of course forgetting that many of the present Member States are still in need of advice and proposals on how to improve their parliamentary life and the operating mechanisms of their parliaments, in order to achieve equal representation between the sexes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I trust you are now convinced that the issue we are debating is important enough to warrant the presence of the competent Commissioner at the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is only natural when we talk of mainstreaming equality of the sexes in all policies and in all areas that we should look to our own House first, as Mrs Kratsa has just said. The European institutions and how they operate should set the standard and an example for both the Member States and the wider world. The European Parliament can offer a valuable framework for exercising policy and drawing useful conclusions about the application of gender equality in practice by encouraging equal representation of the sexes, both in parliamentary office and by promoting women to responsible positions within Parliament and helping women improve their grading and pay at all levels of the administrative hierarchy within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, 6 years after the concept of gender mainstreaming was set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, this important strategy for achieving equality is still not fully operational in either the administration of the European Parliament or its political work. Without wishing to underestimate the efforts made, we have to admit that the European Parliament is lagging behind the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gröner’s important report details and sets out all the crucial issues for consideration, proposing specific measures and methods for combating existing weaknesses. Our committee’s objective is for the European Parliament to set the standard in the application of gender mainstreaming, and we trust that Mrs Gröner’s excellent report will be a benchmark and springboard for achieving this objective. However, we need support and commitment at the highest possible level if we are to achieve this objective and, at the same time, we need funds to ensure that the measures proposed in the report are applied consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of gender mainstreaming must be clearly laid down in the new constitutional Treaty; this is one of my committee’s main objectives in our fight to make the future Europe – and, we hope, the male members of the European Parliament – more aware of gender issues. In all events, I think the decision taken by the Greek Presidency at the recent informal Council at your instigation, Commissioner, for the European Commission to submit an annual report on the application of gender mainstreaming in the Union, was a very important decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like first of all to thank Mrs Gröner for the sterling work she has done. As one has come to expect with Mrs Gröner’s work, there was a long and thorough process leading up to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gröner refers to Article 2 and Article 3(2) of the EC Treaty and to Article 23 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, all of which emphasise the EU’s obligation to promote equality and remove inequalities between men and women. I should also like, in this context, to refer to Article 141(4), which makes it clear that measures may be adopted providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the underrepresented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in no doubt at all that this is particularly aimed at the Member States, but it is in actual fact a principle that ought also to apply here in the European Parliament, for equality will not be achieved until both the political will is present and the appropriate tools are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We are able to observe some general warning signs right now. Once, the debate revolved around women’s freely choosing to create equal opportunities. Now, the debate has in actual fact moved on and altered its focus in many places in Europe. Now, it is increasingly the case that men and women have become equal under the law, and it must therefore be up to women themselves to discover what they want. The debate has moved back into the home. This, however, is to ignore the facts. It is still the case that women earn less, and it will therefore continue to be women who stay at home with the children, meaning that it will go on being men who take the decisions – here in the European Parliament, too.</p>
<p class="contents">31.5% of MEPs are women, but they are distributed over a wide area. 8.7% of Greek, and 44.3% of Swedish, parliamentarians are women. The last example shows how worthwhile it can be making active efforts to promote women’s participation and how it is possible to bring about more equal representation, either through quota arrangements on the individual lists or through the option of preferential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters look quite different as soon as we turn to the indirect and the hierarchical systems. One such indirect system is the European Convention, only 17% of whose members are women, and an example of a hierarchical system is the administration of the European Parliament, which is also short on equality. If we, as the number one democratic institution, cannot set a better example than we are able to do at present, how are we to be able to convince people in Europe that equality is a ‘sine qua non’, or necessity, if we are to have a proper future in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely difficult to implement what the European Parliament is proposing with gender mainstreaming, which I would translate into French as <span class="italic">transversalité</span>. First of all we need to recognise how difficult it is to make policies specific to women, which is why Parliament has a Committee on Women’s Rights, and, at the same time, ensuring that those policies have transverse effects across all committees and in all political issues. That is what this report is proposing. Europe is once again a pioneer in this area and we should be extremely mindful of this twofold problem. We should walk on two feet rather than just one: on the one hand, equality, with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and on the other hand, gender mainstreaming, which is extremely difficult. We all see this every day in our respective committees, outside the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, for which I would again like to thank Mrs Gröner, proposes a two-stage process. On the one hand, it is about affecting decision making, ensuring that gender mainstreaming is applied at all levels within the European Parliament, as I believe it already is, and to a greater extent, in the Commission. On the other hand, the emphasis is not on parity but on equality of the sexes in all areas, thanks to this report, the adoption of which in the plenary I welcome, having myself tabled an amendment for the vote in plenary. I think that this second point is just as fundamental. That is why this report is important both for its pioneering nature and because it highlights the difficulty of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the informal Council meeting last week had already practically ratified some proposals of this report and I am pleased about that. However, I am much less pleased about what is happening with enlargement. Malta has just gained the right to vote on enlargement despite its anti-abortion legislation and its restrictions on divorce, and these seem to have been accepted by Europe and by the fifteen Member States. It also seems that Poland is looking to retain the prerogatives of its laws on gender rights. I question the political will of our fifteen Member States. It has been said that it was important for us to set an example to future Member States, but if we cannot ask them to respect a certain number of established principles regarding women’s rights, I am greatly concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is to not to detract in any way from Mrs Gröner's efforts in this excellent and very full report. When I dream of mainstreaming and the resulting equality between men and women in this institution, I also see the first female secretary-general and a 50/50 division between men and women in all grades. Half of the people working part time would be men and in the late afternoon there would be children running around who had been collected from a crèche for which there was no waiting list, and which had been provided by Parliament. This House would also be run by both sexes in an innovative, progressive way that would result from the differences between the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, however, a dream. I therefore see a the gender mainstreaming report as a missed opportunity to fully integrate the acquis communautaire in respect of equality, including the Hautala directive adopted by the Council not so long ago, into the statute of public servants and the personnel policy of the European Parliament. I find it unacceptable that the Member States introduce equality legislation while the European Parliament fails to do the same. During school holidays or an unforeseen strike at school we see many children running around in this House. They are children of assistants, staff members or of the members themselves. They are not always of an age that they can go to the crèche, assuming that, as in my dream, there is no waiting list. Where in this huge building is there a small play area with toys, paintbrushes, and so on, where we can leave a child safely for a few hours? This would therefore be in keeping with the policy that is aimed at the reconciliation of social, family and working life with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow members, unfortunately I have to inform you that my contribution so far has been based on an argument that I articulated in this House on 8 March 2002 to add lustre to International Women’s Day. Still nothing has changed. It is unbelievable. I would like to conclude by saying that our Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is going to have a major part to play in verifying the implementation of Mrs Gröner’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the overall extension of the protection of the fundamental rights of women in recent years, the integration of the principle of equal opportunities is still not satisfactory in all areas, particularly in the political and administrative fields.</p>
<p class="contents">The balanced and active participation of women and men in political life is a crucial instrument for consolidating a more just and democratic society. Given that Parliament is the institution closest to the citizens and that its commitment to protecting equal opportunities has enabled many policies in this field to be developed, it is its duty to set an example by increasing the integration of women into parliamentary activities and into the institution’s internal structures.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to promote women’s full participation in order to attain a more balanced situation. In the prospect of enlargement and of the 2004 European elections, information campaigns must be undertaken to prepare women who wish to enter the European institutions. This will enable us to prevent the percentage of women Members in the European Parliament slipping even further. I wish to emphasise, without attempting to make a judgement on my own work, that the work undertaken by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has proved to be of crucial importance in raising the awareness of other committees, through the speeches and opinions it has delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Parliament’s administration, I fully support the measures for increasing awareness, information and vocational training, and on squaring the needs of professional and private life, specifically through flexible working hours and making childcare infrastructures available. I do not think, however, that systematically implementing the principle of preference for women candidates for positions of leadership is a suitable alternative, as long as this imbalance persists. I therefore support the amendment tabled by Mr Gargani, who does not agree with such a rigid and mechanical approach, preferring the possibility of adopting positive measures to encourage the under-represented in recruitment, career development and other professional activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has emerged from those days is still quite a bitter taste: we are still victims of inequality and we are still being treated as a minority group, when we represent more than half of the human race. It is with a great deal of regret that I have to observe that this evening, the problem of women appears once again to interest only women, and I hope that tomorrow there will be more of us to stand up and fight against that, as some men fought today, complaining that some very important items, in particular pensions, were being dealt with only at the end of the evening.</p>
<p class="contents">At European Union level, it has to be said that the principle of gender equality is not yet being applied. Mrs Lalumière’s report, which looks at the situation in our institution, says quite clearly that this is the case and makes specific proposals. It is true that we need to deal firmly with this problem and stop hiding behind socio-economic and socio-cultural considerations. We have said that we want to be a fairer and more equal society.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mrs Gröner, for this excellent report, because, for the years to come it will provide an incomparable tool for developing the integrated and transversal approach in our policies, our actions and our budgets. Why? Quite simply because we feel that this integrated approach will lead to a fairer, more democratic society, and that taking into account the differences between men and women will enable us to take better advantage of human resources. We must take an active and effective approach, whether to structures, information policies, the evaluation of our actions, or the collection of statistics. Might I point out that, in less than a year, the Committee on Women’s Rights will be twenty years old? Twenty years is an important milestone, and I hope that we will be able to make a more than positive assessment of all the work that has been done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Man is still the norm, meaning that women treat men in the way that men treat other men; and that many women treat other women in the way that men treat women. That is why the gender mainstreaming methodology is important in supporting a kind of gender-based structural transformation that is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden is usually singled out as the country with the greatest equality, but the fact is that men and women are not equal in Sweden. We are emphatically far from being so. No doubt that says a lot about the situation in the rest of the world. Following the most recent election in Sweden in September 2002, our national parliament consists of 47% women, that is to say even more than the 44.3% mentioned by Mrs Dybkjær. What has enabled this to come about are the parties’ own changes and commitments, as well as what is called the voluntary contract with the electorate who have also actively voted in women.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, I was responsible for gender mainstreaming, which I defended in this Chamber. I cannot see that very much in particular, or even anything at all, has happened in the five years since then. Many have taught themselves to use the term ‘gender mainstreaming’<span class="italic">, </span>but just learning to use a new term does not bring about any changes. Rather, we must all learn to put it into practice. We can begin by adopting and implementing Mrs Gröner’s proposal which, in spite of everything, is quite modest and self-explanatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know this so well because I was involved myself. The basic thought behind this approach, that is that women’s problems are cross-cutting problems, goes back much further however and was applied in policy far earlier. In the Netherlands we spoke of facet policy and policy integration, in Germany we said that women’s policy was a ‘cross-sectional problem’, Mrs Gröner, and in French it was simply called <span class="italic">le mainstreaming</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience acquired varied somewhat. We can now fill quite a bookshelf with the successes and also the problems. Unfortunately we also find misunderstandings on this bookshelf and perhaps even wilful distortions. Some false guides in fact try to sell what is actually specific policy under the guise of gender mainstreaming and that gets us nowhere. Fortunately, in her more than outstanding report, our rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, has erected a dam against such misuse of this term in the European Parliament. The report makes clear once and for all that gender mainstreaming is not a matter of ‘add women and stir’. No, that is not how it is. The idea of gender mainstreaming is to strip so-called general policy of its generality, to shatter this myth and to see how it has a different effect on men and women. Let us realise that we still have a long way to go before this is really understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Many men after all find the idea that their picture of reality is not relevant for women unbearable. Hidden behind these definitions of reality are positions of power which, as feminists know, will never be given up without a struggle. The political question behind this report is therefore the following: are the men who rule the roost in this Parliament really prepared to step aside a little and to share the power with us? As long as we cannot answer that question with a heartfelt yes, we must stay on the path we are following, despite all the pessimistic noises that I hear. We must keep on beating the drum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to emphasise that this is not only a matter of increasing women’s participation in Parliament’s bodies, the various committees and working groups; it is above all a matter of integrating the gender perspective into every stage of drawing up policies in the various working processes of Parliament's committees and delegations, including the budgetary process and in all Community policies, which is extremely important.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I must stress that acting only at that level would only be scratching the surface. There is still a considerable difference between salaries for men and women in companies. Why are the European institutions, which are capable of proposing restrictive directives when it comes to facilitating trade and business, not doing the same to ensure true equality of salaries? Why are they not imposing on all the Member States, including the most backward ones, women's fundamental right to be in charge of their own bodies? That would not be enough to halt the progress of misogyny and violence against women, which is growing in the poverty and ghettos of working-class areas, but it would curb the deterioration of women’s standard of living. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
