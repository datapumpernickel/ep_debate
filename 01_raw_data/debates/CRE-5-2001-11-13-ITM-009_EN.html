<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, the Commission proposal for a decision on market access to port services should be considered and appreciated as part of the comprehensive Commission communication on improved quality of services in ports. This communication was to draw conclusions from the positions of Parliament and of the Council on the Commission's 1997 Green Paper. When we consider the past weeks, we must observe that, whilst the European Parliament was in 1999 still able to agree by a large majority on a position on the Green Paper, the present Commission proposal, which is only intended to regulate market access to services in individual ports, has aroused a great deal of controversy in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as attested by the result of the vote on the report – 26 in favour, 21 against and 11 abstentions. So I hope that today's debate and tomorrow's vote will produce a clear position from this House, something in which I intend to play my part. For if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage, the Council then has the last word. We do not want to trust the Council to that extent, but rather we want to pull our own weight.</p>
<p class="contents">In Committee, the majority supported the Commission's desire to adopt only regulations on competition in individual ports and include in this all service providers. The report is, though, ambiguous on one point, that is, on whether pilot services should fall within the scope of the decision. On the one hand, Amendment No 14 in the Committee's report states that pilot services are not to be affected by the provisions, but the application to delete pilot services from the appendix to the opinion, which alone defines the opinion's scope, was not accepted. That being the case, we, as Parliament, must give a clear lead tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the other amendments in the Committee's report, I would like in particular to highlight the fundamental extension of the scope of the proposal to include port access, be it by sea routes or canals, likewise a more restrictive definition of self-handling and the abandonment of the requirement for at least two service providers per category of cargo handling, likewise the requirement we have incorporated into the opinion, that, when tenders are invited, the new service provider should compensate its predecessor for the investments.</p>
<p class="contents">A minority in the Committee tried to highlight, above all, the Commission's failure to comply with Parliament's 1999 demand for conditions for fair competition between ports in the EU, and produce a proposal for a regulation to create them. The Commission has produced neither a transparency study nor guidelines for the monitoring of aid. A minority in the Committee therefore proposed the adoption of new regulations on transparency in financial relations between ports and State offices and also on permissible State aid measures for ports, the intention being to provide legal protection for ports and also to prevent excessive aid provision.</p>
<p class="contents">For me personally, this is very much about our need to agree tomorrow on this transparency issue, for the issue of transparency and fair conditions for competition between ports is crucial to the ports' ability to function. All of us have repeatedly emphasised that ports play a central role in European transport policy, with 70% of foreign trade and 30% of trade within the Community passing through them. They are significant junctions, and they must work well. I believe that nobody need fear transparency, which leads to fair conditions for competition. That characteristic and criterion is, I believe, a good basis for a real increase in the efficiency of ports.</p>
<p class="contents">In that spirit, I hope we will have a good discussion this afternoon and that this House will vote wisely tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make several things clear: firstly, this is a good proposed directive by the Commission. I repeat: I believe that it is a good proposal, and this has been reflected in the vote in committee. I believe that it is a positive regulation and is very important if the European Union is to have efficient maritime and port services.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that 80% of the European Union’s trade is carried out by sea. And this liberalisation proposed by the Commission will no doubt benefit short sea shipping. Furthermore, there is clearly a need for Community regulation of these services in accordance with the liberalising approach established at the Lisbon Council and which has already been applied in other sectors of services.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are dealing with today includes technical-nautical services (pilotage and mooring) and cargo-handling services. There are no reasons, on the grounds of safety, training or anything else, to justify their exclusion from the scope of the directive. We must clearly take account of the particular nature of ports and the fact that there are services whose provision begins or ends outside the physical area of the port.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential element of the system proposed by the Commission is the concept of self-handling, which is already laid down in Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly mention certain other elements of the port package. We are talking about public funding of ports and the need for great transparency in the financial relations between public authorities and ports and State aid. I agree with certain amendments which try to describe this aspect. But with regard to State aid, it seems clear that this directive is not the right place to discuss this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, although we have disagreed on certain points, for the enormous amount of work he has done and the huge effort he has made to try to reconcile all the proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The openness of seaports, though, bears no relation whatever to the system by which they are financed. Far from it; I think opacity, very often intentional, is the right word to use for it. To put it in nautical language: when it comes to financing seaports, the bulkheads are closed. The present financial structures could be described as hazy and must be changed. I believe that tomorrow's vote must be about transparency in financial relationships and in State finance, for that is the first requirement for fair competition between seaports.</p>
<p class="contents">Granted, that is not exactly easy. Ports are under private, State, joint State and private, and public control, but all of them are enterprises in competition with each other, and so we need fair conditions. Aid is unobjectionable, but it must be aid for all. The problem is, I think, that competition between ports has to be organised. In principle, it occurs within ports or should do so, if all the Community regulations are brought into play.</p>
<p class="contents">Pilot services are another issue. We see them as a public duty, serving safety at sea and the safety of man and nature, and the Member States have essentially reasonable regulations on them. I believe it would be possible to extend them in view of the recurrent accidents off the German Baltic coast. One sometimes gets the impression that, when it comes to navigation, many ships use the Shell atlas and nothing else. So, safety at sea with pilot services must not fall victim to the alleged pressure on costs exerted by competition. I extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur. I know that he has had a difficult job, but his shadow does not always have an easy time of it either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not need to repeat that ports are important. In my view, the Commission proposal helps us to enhance the efficiency of ports. Like a few of my fellow MEPs, however, I have noticed one shortcoming: there are no proposals on state aid and transparency. It would be best, and I have tabled an amendment to that effect, if these new proposals were to come from the Commission and not from the text which we as Parliament are now drafting. Commissioner, I should like to ask you if you would be able to tell us more about possible plans in that direction during this debate. In any event, I hope that my fellow MEPs will support this amendment and that we will therefore ask the Commission to submit new proposals concerning those two points.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, I back the Commission proposal. We must increase competition at ports. This must also include maritime access, not only for technical-nautical services, but also for the handling of cargo and passengers. We should therefore not dispose of the handling of cargo.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that pilotage can also be retained in the directive. As you rightly stated, it forms a significant link in the life of most ports. However, if we prescribe a few requirements, impose a number of conditions in the social field, and give due consideration to economic aspects, the environment and public services, as is the case in the directive and in my amendment, we will have more guarantees than if we simply fall back on the Treaty. For I believe that that is the choice: either we include a special rule for ports in a directive, or we fall back on the Treaty and simply apply to pilotage the general rules of the Treaty which provide for the free movement of services. I think it would be preferable to adopt the Commission proposal in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I am of the opinion that we as Parliament need to cooperate with the Commission constructively, possibly allow for a conciliation procedure with the Council, and ensure that we reinforce the operation of ports and competition in and among ports in a constructive manner to encourage the vital aspect of transport by water as much as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly since the Green Paper actually asked for something else on behalf of Parliament and its handling than what we have now received, namely a consideration of the competition <span class="italic">among</span> ports instead of <span class="italic">in</span> ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? If we look at the various coastlines in Europe, and I can think of a few, there are two, maybe six, seven or eight major ports located within a few hundred kilometres of each other, where competition is mainly generated from that small distance between the ports. Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and so it goes on. The same happens in the Mediterranean in the south. However, this leads to distorted competition which does not really benefit us. So that is the first problem. It also leads to overcapacity and the funding of this overcapacity. That too is a thorn in our side, and we should like to see common guidelines in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">This, in turn, impacts on the environment, it results in an excessive use of space and generates all kinds of additional problems which we as Greens are also being faced with to a considerable extent. In terms of competition among ports, we would therefore actually like to propose more transparency and that a reasonable amount of thought be given to state aid. We would sooner call for coordination <span class="italic">among</span> ports, which we would like to add to the objectives of this study along with transparency, and not only the opening of competition <span class="italic">in</span> ports, which has been the subject of discussion thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">If we turn our attention to competition within ports, as is formulated here, we would particularly like to see the pilotage scrapped for safety and environmental reasons. I believe that we can rely on majority backing for this. We also believe it would be wise to delete the handling of cargo, since it does not in any way benefit competition. Finally, following on from transparency, we call for autonomous research to be carried out. This research should be autonomous vis-à-vis, yet commissioned by, Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The removal of constrictions on free movement of services within the Community does not in fact mean only liberalisation and privatisation, but also European harmonisation with due regard being given to Member States' rights to provide public services in defence of the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">It is noticeable that the rapporteur took account of data specific to ports and attempted to include in his report not only requirements for safety, environmental protection and social standards but also the economic needs of ports. The vote in Committee is evidence of the fact that opinion was not divided on group lines but that there were differences of outlook specific to different countries. Removal of pilot services, cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of the directive is something I can go along with, as is the retention of licences granted to previous service providers and the setting of minimum standards for new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's draft has also undergone radical amendment with regard to financial settlement for investments made and the transparency of the financial relationship between ports and State authorities. Briefly, Mr Jarzembowski's report changes the Commission's document in the right direction. As, though, I thoroughly share the view of many of my fellow Members, namely that port services should generally be left to the Member States, I intend to abstain in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whereas initially, it was a very logical report which, in my view, contained a reasonably correct interpretation of the facts, we now have before us an incoherent document which spawns many comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall confine myself to the key points. Firstly, the alleged state aid of Member States for their ports forms the root of the problem. If government funding for ports does not become transparent, other measures can hardly take effect. Closer examination of this funding should therefore be given the highest priority, followed by a clear, financial framework which distinguishes legal from illegal support.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the inclusion of cargo handling in the proposal prejudices the port authorities’ sovereignty to pursue their own strategic policy. It is reported to lead to the breach of existing, long-term contracts, which will have far-reaching financial implications for the relevant services. Furthermore, the maintenance of existing contracts renders the present legislation superfluous. When these contracts lapse, it is likely that economic insights will have changed yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am of the opinion that pilotage can also remain excluded from this legislation. I would draw your attention to an amendment which aims to secure surety from governments to render the use of technical-nautical services, in particular, mandatory. Without surety, considerable problems can arise in the smaller ports. That cannot be the intention, if I have understood everyone correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear: without a number of essential changes, we will be unable to vote in favour of the present report. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should also congratulate Commissioner de Palacio on the substance of the proposal which she submitted to us and which is based on the liberalisation of port services, which she wishes to push on with. Not as an end in itself, but as a means of bringing about better, cheaper services and improving the competitiveness of the European economy. And, of course, when we speak of competitiveness and liberalisation and apply them to telecommunications, energy, the railways, we cannot leave out port services. This too is another brick in the wall of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that ports are a rule unto themselves, as is every sector. Obviously we need to look at the question of aid and how it can be reconciled with the rules of transparency. We need to look at the specific problem of pilotage, which several Members have already mentioned, and see how pilotage relates to safety. Consequently, we need to look at a whole host of other issues. But this should not lead us into ignoring the material facts and the material facts are that liberalising port services will have a beneficial effect on competitiveness and our objective of providing better, cheaper services to those who use them.</p>
<p class="contents">So the message which we need to send out from this debate is clear: a dual message of liberalisation and transparency. Of course there are groups which will be affected by these proposals. Of course there are interests which do not like these proposals. But the greater good is the objective of competitiveness, and the growth and jobs which it creates. And I believe that the philosophy behind the proposal before us serves precisely this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Chairman Hatzidakis is right: we must have the courage to say ‘no’ to those pressure groups which sometimes attempt to prevent the Commission and the institutions from tackling areas affecting them which Europe has never clearly addressed.<span class="bold"> </span>I therefore feel this proposal for a directive is appropriate in order to regulate and improve access to the port market and services. The calls for safety, the protection of workers, quality of service and, of course, respect for the environment, are appropriate and vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two points on this subject: we, like the Commission, believe that it is right and proper to include in the scope of this directive terminal cargo handling services, in particular, that is those services which represent over 90% of the volume of business of ports. In addition, we feel that, if an exception is to be laid down to the application of this directive on grounds of safety or environmental protection, it would thus make no sense to limit it just to pilots and exclude the other technical-nautical services.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we do not feel that this directive is the most appropriate instrument to address the issue of the public financing system. There are too many discrepancies between the systems of the 15 countries of the European Union and some extremely grey areas continue to remain. Consider – and we must be quite honest about this – how, in some of the major ports of northern Europe, there is proof of commitment to State financing<span class="bold"> </span>in the fact that representatives of public authorities sit on the<span class="bold"> </span>managing bodies of the individual ports.

I would like to make several points:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the philosophy of liberalisation must include making the process more flexible so that it does not lead to dangerous or inappropriate radicalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must take account of the geographical reality of the seaports in the various regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the jobs of the port workers affected must be guaranteed, as well as their social protection. And on transposing this directive in the various Member States, the principle of subsidiarity must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons that have allowed me to support this directive with certain clarifications, and justify certain particular amendments, which are coherent amongst themselves, and which deal with the fact that certain regions of the Member States affected are of an insular or peripheral nature, where the port is paramount and, in many cases, quality services are already provided.</p>

In my opinion, these proposals will address the living and working conditions of port staff but I do not feel that they will improve them. We are told that improvements are taking place, but, as is all too often the case, there has been no prior study of the effects of this liberalisation, in particular with regard to such important issues as safety, the environment and employment. Those affected have not been consulted, in particular, trade unions (we can always call them ‘lobbies’ if you prefer), even though they know the safety needs of people and the environment, and have unrivalled knowledge. Although the amendments made to Mr Jarzembowski’s report take into consideration certain problems that I have just raised, in my opinion they are far from adequate. They do nothing to temper the line taken by the text as a whole. Self-handling in the ports would therefore equate to allowing social dumping. Given the current practices of commercial fleets, this measure will lead to inadequate safety levels and the deterioration of environmental safety, employment and working conditions. I will support the amendments that seek to exclude dockers from the directive. These staff carry out an important economic task under difficult conditions, while still ensuring safety. Nautical services for piloting and mooring are universally recognised as services of general interest. They should, in my opinion, be considered as partners in their own right, with a view to sustainable development. Well then, the proposals of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, do take account of pilots but not of mooring service providers, which I personally regret. I believe that the European Union should work towards harmonisation at the top end of working and employment conditions for employees in this sector, which is the only way to genuinely guarantee economic and social effectiveness while respecting the environment. The proposals made to date will not, in my opinion, take us any further towards these essential objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The owners tell me that this directive has been prepared without thorough consultation and that, if passed, it will be seriously damaging to the whole UK port industry. They say that it would force many ports to restructure, yet would do nothing to improve efficiency in a cargo handling market characterised by competition between ports, not within ports. Thus, if there are problems of restrictive practices in cargo handling and pilotage in some continental ports, they should be tackled by individual Member States.</p>

That was our position then and I hope it is going to be our position tomorrow, but so far the Commissioner has failed to explain why she has ignored that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, so far the Commission has ignored the question of why there has been no regulatory impact assessment on this proposal. Whether you are for it or against it, it is extraordinary that such a proposal as this is not subject to the assessment that President Prodi assured the House would apply to all new Commission proposals. Why is Mr Prodi not honouring commitments given to this House?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, why is this proposal so over-prescriptive? Why is it going to burden a successful industry with more red tape, with no justification whatsoever? Why does it seek to regulate in minute detail every aspect of a port's operation? Why, for example, does it call for cargo handling to be provided by at least two service providers for each type of cargo? How can that make any sense when you are trying to organise the arrangements at ports? Bearing all that in mind and unwelcome as the proposal is, it is even more extraordinary that it does not address the issue of state aids or transparency of accounts.

The lesson to be drawn from our experience is that the crucial issue is not really market competition or privatisation, as such, but quality, greater efficiency and good, cleverly designed organisation. These are aspects to which the Commission has given insufficient consideration in its proposal. I want to express my thanks to Mr Jarzembowski who, as rapporteur, has come up with many criticisms of the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a number of important exceptions, and I shall point out a couple of these. Quite a few speakers have referred to pilotage. I believe that pilotage is quite clearly a service for the benefit of everyone. Pilotage must not therefore be regarded in terms of the same economic criteria as ordinary production, but from a safety perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking responsibility oneself can have very serious consequences when it comes to loading and unloading. That especially applies in view of the fact that flags of convenience are a common phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of transparency and public scrutiny where ports are concerned. I am in favour of self-financed ports. I want to see quality and efficiency brought about through ports’ preparing their own development programmes instead of being subjected to extensive forms of control from Brussels.

Unlike in the past, modern port users are uncommitted: they choose their port on the basis of price and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">There are important financial channels that run from authorities to port companies. A need for more insight into the investment flows has arisen. In addition, a level playing field is needed for all interested parties. This situation could be improved by setting up a number of basic rules. I should like to highlight a few aspects in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the scope of the directive. It does not simply cover the port itself, but mainly the port users. Deleting cargo handling from the directive will not benefit the quality of the service which ports offer their customers. Freight services, or cargo handling, should simply remain in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, ship services, also referred to as pilotage and towage services. Amendments Nos 3, 14 and 51 aim to keep pilotage outside the scope of the directive, based on the outmoded notion that pilotage services are always public services. I will not support these amendments. In my country, pilotage services have not been a public service for a very long time, and that has worked out very well.</p>
<p class="contents">A directive which regulates market access to port services therefore covers both ship and port services. Needless to say, we must move towards more transparency of the financial flows with regard to infrastructure, but I should like to leave the powers where they are, and will therefore vote in favour of Mr Sterckx’ Amendment No 47 in which the Commission is still being requested to submit proposals in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters is that ports facilitate reshipment and receiving companies. Ports and their users deserve solid, well-thought-out legislation. I regret that the way in which this directive has been dealt with in Parliament has created unnecessary tension between northern, southern and western Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were supposed to address the issue of competition in ports and we are now being presented with a text on competition between ports. I do not know what will happen tomorrow, but I am sure there will be some confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In passing, I regret that the mooring service providers’ lot is not the same as the pilots’. I do not see why we would maintain competition for mooring service providers while excluding pilots. These professions are fairly similar.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to competition between ports, I feel that transparency is a good thing, but I would warn you against going straight from that to decreeing competition between ports without closer analysis, for ports are first and foremost tools for regional development. They do not have the same nautical qualities. Moreover, if we were to increase competition, your entire sustainable mobility policy would fall through. I actually think that, in years to come, we will have to help the southern ports and the ports on the Atlantic coast take over from the over concentrated mass of North Sea ports. Otherwise, we will be going against both the Erika-Maritime Safety package and our desire to remove lorries from the major transit countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission will actually have to present us with specific proposals on State aid to ports focusing on regional development rather than just competition between products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ports are clearly a very important factor when we discuss fulfilment of the Kyoto commitments in as much as they can ease the pressure on land transport and make things easier in a wide range of other areas. It is therefore essential from an environmental point of view to have some of the goods at present conveyed by land transported instead by sea. If this is to happen successfully, ports must be efficient, and we must therefore see liberalisation within those areas proposed by the Commission: loading and unloading, passenger services and whatever else has been mentioned, presumably with some exemptions in special regions. Perhaps outlying districts, in particular, can ask to be accorded special consideration. However, that too has, of course, been mentioned in the report. I hope that, in the light of the many views presented in this House, we shall now be able to agree upon a proposal so that together we are able to support the Commission’s overall goal for the benefit of the whole of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will quite happily note in our logbook that it is not about seeing things in black and white when liberalising and creating free and fair competition, simply in order to adhere to a principle. The unedifying dispute about duty free is still in my mind. This discussion about ports is also about jobs, attractive business propositions and public profile, and I want to take part in it, we need to define transparency rules for the calculation of costs and the use of public funds by ports, in order to establish fair competition within ports and between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Only transparency about the flow of public funds and services will make it possible to compare the services offered by the various seaports and in that way demonstrate which works more efficiently. Comparability of services creates competition, and transparency is, in consequence, indispensable if we want to have long-term liberalisation of the market in port services. I will say in addition that, at this time, we should not yet liberalise the pilot services. Pilots have, as at present organised, long maintained a high standard of quality and safety on sea routes.</p>
<p class="contents">These extraordinarily high standards would be needlessly jeopardised by liberalisation at any cost. Every market structure contains components for which quality rather than competition must come first. Of course, the pilots will one day have to adopt a new approach – one day. Even they will not be able to resist the opening-up of the market forever, but as far as safety at sea is concerned, there are at present more pressing matters such as, for, example, the introduction of a 'black box' for ships. Immediately forcing pilots to be subject to competition would, under certain circumstances, lead to a price war that could compromise the safety of shipping lanes in the long term.</p>

Sabena is a warning example of the kind of inefficiency that centrally managed industrial policies can produce in the worst possible case.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we exclude cargo handling from the directive on ports, all that would be left of it would be an empty shell. This is why Amendment 52 is dangerous. Although I am in favour of the inclusion of all major ports, I can, nevertheless, give my support to Amendment 79 proposed by Mr Atkins. This amendment would restrict the directive to covering public ports only. My British colleagues could then accept the inclusion of cargo handling without any concern. We must not forget that British exporters benefit from reasonably priced port services in continental Europe. The numbers of port operators should not be restricted except for compelling reasons. Should economic efficiency be accepted as a criterion for restricting the numbers, this would leave a great deal of room for speculation as to when operations are efficient and when they are not. This is a reason why Amendments 6, 25 and 44 should not be seconded. On the other hand, Amendment 50 on the definition of the port system is not acceptable because, according to the amendment, a port in Greece and a port in Germany, for example, could be construed as forming a single port. I am sorry but this is an absurd idea. As regards pilotage, we, the members of the committee, concluded that strict national rules should apply. Therefore, safety aspects cannot be used as an excuse for a monopoly.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it our intention then to prevent the development of EU ports by diluting the directive that has been awaited for so long? Cargo handling and pilotage, based on national rules, should be included, absolutely. Also, the port system should be defined in a concise manner. My highly honourable colleague Jarzembowski’s ideas on this matter are, unfortunately, a long way away from the actual needs of port users. We cannot change Europe into a giant Hamburg. The committee has reached a good compromise and we should clearly stick to that. ‘Eurosclerosis’ hits the poor hardest. Now we have a good opportunity to do a favour to European employment and sustainable development. Let us pilot Europe towards competitive ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ports along the coast between Hamburg and Le Havre, spanning Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, largely service the same <span class="italic">hinterland</span>. They have traditionally competed with each other with low tariffs and large public investments to secure the highest possible cargo levels for their quays. This competition involves taxpayers’ money, and there is unnecessary secrecy about the use of taxpayers’ money. An orderly and scheduled distribution of tasks among those ports saves public funding and better provides the port workers with sustainable employment without the unnecessary peaks and troughs. That is why I support the remarkable agreement between a large contingent to the Left and rapporteur Jarzembowski, which reminds us of the position which this Parliament has adopted once before, namely the position that transparent competition among ports is far more useful than organising competition in the ports. Competing pilotage and towage services are at the expense of safety, working conditions and job security.

It has clearly been difficult work, and we must all be aware of what is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask Parliament as a whole to try to give the rapporteur the greatest support possible, with certain slight modifications to what Mr Jarzembowski proposes, since, for once, I do not agree with some of his suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that 70% of trade with third countries depends on the efficiency of our ports. It is clear that sea ports play an essential role in relation to the European Union’s trade. But furthermore, if we want to deal with the future of transport within the European Union in a credible fashion, not trade between the European Union and third countries, where we will continue to depend largely on sea transport, but within the European Union, we must move on from words and declarations to actions, once and for all, and make short sea shipping a reality. This requires our ports to be as competitive, as efficient and as well-interconnected with adjacent territories as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, to this end, a few months ago, ports were incorporated into the trans-European networks for the first time, precisely so that they may be fully integrated into the Union’s internal transport system and thereby play a crucial role in making that system sustainable and competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is part of a package which deals with various issues of port policy: the transparency of flows of public funds destined for ports; criteria for what is State aid and what is not. It deals with aspects relating to competition between ports. The proposed directive which you must vote on deals with the issue of competition between service providers within ports, covering all the services that are normally provided to port users and are of commercial value.</p>
<p class="contents">In a moment I will mention something which several of you have referred to; competition between ports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, now we are going to talk about the proposed directive relating to competition within ports. The proposal is based on two pillars: one relating to content and the other to procedures. With regard to content, we propose bringing ourselves into line with the legislation passed by Parliament and the Council in similar areas, where rules have been established to open up the markets. I am talking about telecommunications, gas, electricity, but especially, in the transport sector, ground services at airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Treaty does not in principle allow restrictions to market access, the ports have their own specific characteristics such as possible space limitations and the fundamental importance of safety and environmental issues. Our proposal guarantees a fair balance between these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that, in its vote, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism expressed its satisfaction with this approach. We must allow self-handling in ports where operators consider that they can obtain better performance from their own personnel and equipment and we must guarantee that, as in the case of all the other sectors, the number of service providers can only be restricted for justifiable reasons, such as space limitations, or the safety of sea traffic in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">All competent service providers must have equal opportunities to operate in the ports of their choice. This brings me to the second pillar of our proposal: procedures. The procedural rules must be transparent, non-discriminatory, objective and proportionate. This is not always the case at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that what was possible for ground services at airports must also be possible for ports. And I believe that, although it is going to create certain problems, as is always the case when there is a change to a situation that has remained the same for a long time, perhaps even for centuries, it is certain that this change will be of benefit to the whole system, to the economy and to the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, specific local characteristics must be taken into account, above all on issues relating to safety, the environment and social aspects. Our proposal will therefore allow for a high level of flexibility on a national, regional and, above all, local level, so that ports can manage their own affairs in an open and balanced fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">Focussing now on the amendments, I would like to say that, having examined them in detail, the Commission can accept most of them. Many amendments improve our proposal substantially with regard to the clarification of the definitions of port services and self-handling and they include compensation rules which are not only implicit, but also explicit, as is the case with Amendments Nos 18, 20, 32 and, in part, Amendment No 46, which we fully accept. I would also like to mention Amendment No 15, which allows Member States to extend the scope of the directive to inland waterways close to ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we accept part of Amendments Nos 25 and 44 which limit, for reasons of maritime safety, the number of service providers rather than that of just providers of technical-nautical services. It is a reasonable measure and it is in accordance with the Commission’s general interests in the field of maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the idea that the time period finally approved in relation to the maximum periods of authorisation should facilitate normal repayment and performance of investments, and we therefore accept an extension of the time limit and also, possibly, compensation where total repayment has not taken place, as certain other amendments suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other amendments that, although they do not introduce changes, provide useful clarifications, particularly in relation to the continued application of the rules currently in force with regard to safety, the environment and social issues. All of these amendments can be accepted, though with modifications to their wording.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are issues that we cannot accept, for various different reasons, and you must understand this, ladies and gentlemen. In the case of certain amendments to the recitals of the directive, they do not really correspond to the legislative text itself, for example: Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 12. Neither can the Commission accept amendments that substantially change or reduce the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Having reached this point, please allow me to point out two problems which have been at the centre of the debates in Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism: should ground services be included in the scope of the directive? The enormous majority of parties accept that this inclusion is necessary, and we could not accept any amendment, such as No 52, which leads to the exclusion of this sector. If we want modern, high-quality ports, that which is possible and necessary for ground services in airports must also be possible and necessary in ports. Furthermore, this position received majority support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true with the amendments aimed at excluding self-handling and the right of service providers to employ the personnel of their choice, such as Amendments Nos 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73, which are also rejected. The latter is already included in the legislation. However, if you read our proposal correctly, you will see that service providers cannot employ so-called ‘pirate workers’. It is not possible. If these misunderstandings can be overcome by clarifying our text, the Commission is prepared to seek an appropriate wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the issue of pilotage. The question is once again whether pilotage can be included in the directive or not. Many people believe that certain safety considerations make it difficult to include this particular sector, but there are ways to ensure safety which are different from those which are currently applied. The same is true for other technical-nautical services, which is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments which exclude<span class="bold"> </span>pilotage from the scope of the directive. In this regard also, Parliament’s relevant committee supported our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain other amendments are also unacceptable for various reasons: specifically, economic considerations concerning the service provider should not be a criterion, as is mentioned in the second part of Amendment No 25. Service providers must accept commercial risks and public authorities must not carry out economic assessments. Having said this, our proposal leaves a door open: when exceptional circumstances arise relating to the volume of cargo, the number of service providers may be restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, without going into detail, we cannot accept various amendments for technical reasons and the list is available to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer to Amendment No 26. Our proposal indicates that normally, and I repeat, normally, at least two service providers will have to be authorised for each category of cargo. If we were to remove this article, we would have to apply the rule established in another paragraph, which would authorise the greatest possible number of service providers, a consequence which I do not believe was intended on presenting this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain amendments express the desire to put more stress on competition between ports than the Commission’s package on ports does. Please allow me to deal with this issue by saying that I agree with the need to consider competition between ports as well, but I think that we need to find a more appropriate way of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the increase in transparency: Amendments Nos 9 and 48. The Commission accepts this principle and I am counting on your support so that we can jointly find the best way to apply this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is the State aid mentioned in Amendment No 49. We all agree that this State aid should not exist, but we must first provide a clear definition of the dividing line between what is State aid and what is not. The Treaty lays down that the Commission and only the Commission applies the Treaty’s rules in the field of State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The current legislative process will focus on this issue and I hope that we can sit down together to find a viable solution, within the framework of the Treaty, which clarifies such a thorny issue. And if it is necessary to go further – and I have the impression from what you have said, and I share many of your concerns, that this is the case – I must say that I am prepared to go further than the provisions of the current proposal in the fields of State aid to ports and competition between ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a few words on Amendment No 79, which proposes excluding private ports, many of which do not apply access restrictions. During the legislative process, we will have to study ways of suitably dealing with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this is only the beginning of the legislative process. During this long process, the Commission will be open to finding constructive solutions with the European Parliament which will allow us to be able to count upon the broadest possible support for this proposal, which is aimed at ensuring that a mature industry, an industry which has much to gain from the restructuring of the European transport industry, can meet the challenges before us and make a crucial contribution to our creating a sustainable transport system at the service of economic development, the creation of jobs, respect for the environment and the quality of life of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
