<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marinho (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, the fight against financial crime and, in particular, crime involving money laundering, will feature at various points in today’s plenary sitting, and this reflects the political importance of the legal instruments which the European Union wishes to establish for the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice. Following the creation of the internal market and the corresponding liberalisation of capital and of financial services, the Union has committed itself to the fight against money laundering. This is a complex crime, which requires another, original, crime to have taken place, resulting in illegal profits that people attempt to recycle into normal, legal economic life. Money laundering, which is the final destination for the proceeds of international crime and a consequence of the globalisation of the economy and of the gradual liberalisation of trade, is at the heart of organised crime, as stated in the Tampere conclusions, and is often the result of drug trafficking. It is a sobering thought that the fight to end this activity involves seizing the proceeds of the original crime, which are later disguised as respectable wealth. The only way to ensure that this fight is effective is through international cooperation, which in Europe, in the face of international crime, takes the form of judicial cooperation between all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, therefore, highlights the measures proposed by the French Presidency, which, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency, has moved ahead with initiatives to approximate legislation, in line with the Tampere Council conclusions. The Treaty of Amsterdam has also been implemented, not forgetting the good work that the Commission has carried out in this area and the commitment and clear thinking of Commissioner Vitorino. There is, therefore, coherence between the three initiatives that are the subject of my report and of the reports by Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Roure in that the framework decision forces the Member States to comply with the outcome, in that Europol’s competence is extended to cover money laundering in terms of investigations and in that a convention improves mutual legal assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore heading in the right direction for the creation of a broad, effective legal framework, which will at least limit this type of crime. My report clearly supports the crux of the rationale behind the framework decision, with proposals that seek fundamentally to enable Member States to confiscate goods gained from serious crimes and to force them to punish offenders committing money-laundering crimes and to legislate against them, without the flexibility offered by the loopholes in previous legal instruments which made it easy for criminals to thumb their noses at the law and to control whole economies. We also support the result of the binding nature of the framework decision, which forces Member States to harmonise their laws for the common good whilst being subject to judicial supervision by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also contains some criticism, however, of the French proposal. Why should only a part of the previous joint action be transposed, which would leave these measures split into weak and strong legislation due to their different natures, highlighting the fragility of joint action? Why not accept straightaway the complete transposal of the whole set into the framework decision, as stated in the amendments that I proposed, Nos 9, 12, 13 and 14? Nor do we feel that tracing and confiscating goods should be restricted to cases in which the original crimes are classed as serious. This would open up a totally unjustifiable and huge area of law consisting of crimes that will not be prosecuted at all. Hence Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Lastly, although I must reiterate my appreciation of the French and Portuguese initiatives under the genuinely broader scope that Amsterdam, despite everything, has provided – and let us be frank about this, the Commission has been able to turn this to good advantage – there are still such differences in the origin and the effectiveness of the various judicial methods, directives, joint actions, framework decisions, conventions and international conventions that it is becoming urgent to communitise judicial, criminal and civil law, and thereby create an area of justice at the service of freedom and security.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that this is not already a priority in the reform of the Treaties, since the current IGC is at the mercy of the weight of the various Member States and of the measures that they wish to implement… We nevertheless believe that the public will shortly be in a position to demand this new aspect of Europe. They will be able to force through a revision of the Treaties that is concerned with their genuine interests and we believe that this revision will indeed be carried out in the name of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Karamanou is sadly unable to be with us tonight, but I feel it appropriate that her report should be debated along with Mr Marinho’s excellent report, which we have just discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Republic of Portugal presented a draft Protocol amending Article 2 of the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office, Europol. This Portuguese initiative aims to extend Europol’s competences in order to establish a general framework of competence for Europol in relation to money laundering. The fight against money laundering is, of course, one of the Union’s most important priorities, as rightly identified at the Tampere Summit last year. Considering that money laundering is at the heart of organised crime, especially drug trafficking, which represents such a threat to public health and public security, one cannot but endorse this proposed measure. Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. This proposed Protocol should be seen as a necessary measure in a European strategy for police cooperation in the field of money laundering. But considering the urgency, our rapporteur seeks in her Amendment No 6 to have this Protocol adopted as quickly as possible that is, according to Article 34(2)(d) of the Treaty on European Union, when a majority of Member States have notified their approvals.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee which I have the honour to chair adopted Mrs Karamanou’s report nearly unanimously. Much as we approved of the Portuguese initiative, however, we insist on a broader revision of the Europol Convention and indeed on mechanisms to ensure both democratic accountability and judicial control of Europol. Let me touch briefly on those two matters. On the question of democratic accountability, I note that at the moment Article 39 of the Europol Convention requires that the European Parliament simply be consulted on an annual report. This is quite unacceptable and on several recent occasions, Parliament has requested, in particular in the Nassauer and Cederschiöld reports, modifications to the Europol Convention to ensure true democratic accountability of this agency. In order for Parliament to exercise such democratic control, Europol must, as with the other European institutions such as the ECB and the Ombudsman, report on its activities in an annual exchange of views. The Director of Europol should be required to appear before Parliament’s competent committees when circumstances require. Moreover, Parliament should be represented on the management board of Europol and should have a say in the choice of the director of the agency. These requests are covered in Amendments Nos 2 and 4 of Mrs Karamanou’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">On questions of judicial accountability, it seems to us equally unacceptable that possible disputes or conflicts between Member States or between Europol and Member States cannot be brought before the Court of Justice, despite the provisions of Article 35 of the Treaty which refer precisely to matters relating to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. This contradiction conflicts with democratic values, particularly in regard to human rights, and especially in the field of data protection. This lack of judicial accountability of Europol is particularly dangerous given that Europol seems to be assuming more and more responsibilities and this concern is covered in Mrs Karamanou’s Amendment No 5.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Parliament has considered attentively and positively this Portuguese initiative but we are unsatisfied with the limited scope of the proposed revision of the Europol Convention. Faced with the challenge of internationally organised crime, the European Parliament must be able to represent the citizens of the Union effectively and this is why we must be fully informed of and involved in Europol’s activities, its programmes, effectiveness, methods and means. I am fully aware that in this matter Parliament is only consulted. Nevertheless, we urge the French Presidency, which has shown such a determined commitment to fight against money laundering, to take account of our demands. The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency under the sole control of national governments. This is a major area of European integration and the European Parliament is ready to offer its support to policies in this area provided it is duly involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roure (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, international criminal networks have become considerably stronger and more organised in recent years. Factors such as globalisation can be seen to have enhanced the possibilities of laundering dirty money and the means of avoiding prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">According to figures released by the United Nations, 1 000 billion dollars are recycled every year through money laundering operations. Money laundering is a difficult offence to detect, and crime syndicates take advantage of every loophole in the various legal systems. As a result, international cooperation in police and judicial matters is the only way of effectively thwarting this illegal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, mutual assistance in criminal matters has already, in general terms, seen the adoption of several texts, such as the Council of Europe’s Convention of 20 April 1959 and, very recently, the European Convention of 29 May 2000, for which our fellow MEP, Mr Di Pietro, acted as rapporteur. In the more specific area of combating money laundering, we could cite the Council Directive of 10 June 1991, as recently amended, for which our fellow MEP, Mr Lehne, acted as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative from the French Presidency that we are examining today is aimed at improving the two blanket conventions on mutual assistance in criminal matters that I have just mentioned, specifically in the field of combating money laundering. The convention that we have before us improves these earlier texts, and we welcome these improvements. By virtue of Article 2 of the draft Convention, the Member States can no longer decline to conduct searches or seize items by invoking the reservations set out in Article 5 of the Convention of 1959. Article 4 states that in order to facilitate enquiries, the Member States must take appropriate measures to promote the transfer and safekeeping of data relating to the existence, location and movement of the proceeds of crime, while Article 5 states that the Member States are required to furnish information on banking activities. Article 6, for its part, provides for the making of supplementary requests for mutual assistance, and Article 7 states that fiscal exceptions can no longer constitute a reason for refusing mutual assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">One can only approve of the body of measures contained in this draft Convention. They respond to the concerns expressed by the Tampere European Council concerning the fight against money laundering, which is the very root of organised crime and which must be eradicated wherever it is found.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem to me that certain improvements could be proposed, and that is the point of my report. The non-invocability of banking and commercial secrecy in response to requests for mutual assistance is set down in Article 3. It would seem to me essential to extend this non-invocability to encompass the commercial and financial advice activities of lawyers and members of regulated legal professions, which due to their nature are not governed by professional secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Article 8 of the draft Convention limits the reasons which Member States may invoke for refusing to provide assistance to “essential interests”. This represents progress, but for mutual assistance not to lose any of its impact in an area in which only rapid cooperation at European level can be of any meaning, it would seem worthwhile to only grant the Member State asked for information two months in which to make known its refusal to give assistance.</p>

That is also why we have only submitted a very small number of proposals for amendments, because we can, of course, agree to this proposal. There is a broad consensus in all of the European institutions – including, of course, here in this House – that we want to take all reasonable and possible steps to counter money laundering. Previous speakers have already said all that needs to be said in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">But, since I am now actually standing here and have the opportunity to comment on the issue of combating money laundering, I should very much like to voice some criticism. I should like to criticise something which actually has nothing at all to do with the proposal which we are debating today, but with the impact of the political position adopted by the Council on the second directive to combat money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, the European Parliament tried to work in close cooperation with the Council. I can only say that, as a result, the Council did admittedly make a big show of cooperating, but the bulk of the amendments tabled by us and adopted here in this House by a very large majority were not accepted. In this respect, I can only say that if the concept of combating money laundering is damaged, then this is the fault of the Council and not of Parliament. The rules which were designed in the past with banks and providers of financial services in mind have been applied, as it were, wholesale to some of the liberal professions, despite the fact that they are not at all suitable for them, and in full knowledge of the fact that under these circumstances it would be absolutely impossible to avoid a difficult second reading with the European Parliament and a conciliation procedure at the end. After all, this is certainly not about the privileges of lawyers or practitioners of other liberal professions. It is about fundamental rights. Quite simply, it is about a client seeking legal advice or support before a court being able – as is also stated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, by the way – to go to a lawyer whom he trusts and to obtain his advice, without, if he reveals something to him, the lawyer being obliged to go directly to the public prosecutor’s office to blow the whistle on him. This is a fundamental right. This fundamental right must not be meddled with. The same goes for all areas where legal advice is dispensed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very grateful for the compromise formulation in the Roure report which was drafted here in committee, which has simply made it clear that this traditional protection of fundamental rights must continue to be guaranteed. I should also like to make it clear, however, that when lawyers fulfil the same functions as banks and financial service providers, then there is obviously no reason to protect that part of their activities. But this is about dispensing legal advice and representing people before a court of law. The protection of fundamental rights must be guaranteed in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, that is why I support the proposals on the table today but, at the same time, I would take this opportunity to give you advance notice that there will be a real battle with the Council over the common position on the second directive to combat money laundering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Allow me to start by congratulating Mr Marinho on his work and to say that, although we need to support efforts to combat financial crime, we also need to be careful. The problem of financial crime is extremely complex: first it is a convoluted attempt to launder the proceeds of illegal activity and, secondly, it presupposes a series of other crimes which generated the illegal proceeds in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that European society today is being crushed by organised crime, in all its manifestations. Financial crime, and first and foremost, perhaps, money laundering, is right at the epicentre of the organised crime plaguing Europe. Without doubt, the initiative of the French Presidency, on which Mr Marinho has taken a stance, is the right initiative; however, the same holds true of Mr Marinho’s attempt to introduce stricter rules. Of course, if we want results, we need to get right to the heart, right to the key of the tool which will help us fight these crimes. In my view, the key to fighting these crimes is to improve judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was reading the explanatory statements attached to Mr Marinho’s amendments, one, in particular, caught my eye. It says that economic Europe has reached a highly advanced stage. Political Europe is progressing slowly but, unfortunately, 15 internal borders continue to exist wherever judges and magistrates, legal proceedings and court decisions are concerned. This phrase troubled me greatly because I think it is the key to the problem. And I think – and I too fervently propose – that we need to take a great many steps, a great many fundamental steps, if we are to achieve judicial cooperation at European level and be able to fight crimes such as financial crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Evidence of the fact that my congratulations are not just rhetorical is that these reports gained an absolute majority of votes in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. I therefore agree with their words and the contents of their reports. Now, Madam President, in Mrs Karamanou’s absence, I should like to focus on expressing my group’s position on her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol’s mandate is to prevent and combat certain forms of criminal activity. The draft Protocol we have before us, the result of an initiative by the Portuguese Presidency complementing other initiatives we have studied today, aims to extend the competences of Europol to money laundering in general. The fight against money laundering only comes into Europol’s current competences incidentally in connection with the types of crime that it deals with.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposed revision is to establish a general framework of competence for Europol in relation to money laundering. Thus, the proposed revision incorporates in Article 2(2) the combating of money laundering as one of Europol’s new tasks. That notwithstanding, Paragraph 3 of the same article states that Europol’s competence with regard to money laundering does not extend to the original offences, i.e. the crimes which preceded the money laundering and are not included in Paragraph 2. For the rest of the draft Protocol, the usual procedure for adoption by the Member States is presented.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the seriousness of the money laundering problem throughout the world and its key role in the development of crime, we must approve the extension of Europol’s competence in this area. But if consultation of the European Parliament were limited to this formal aspect and we could not bring up other topics in this debate – a report without a debate – we could merely have told Europol that we agree and that it is necessary to make every means available to combat money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is only of interest if, through debating it, Parliament can formulate considerations and proposals on the way Europol operates and on its control. At this stage, I shall restrict myself to these two types of consideration, taking it as read that we are in favour of the fight against money laundering and that Europol should deal with it, although we do not support doing so through Council decisions or on the basis of sporadic national initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on these two topics, which are the only ones I am going to deal with, we might wonder how effectively Europol operates now that its competences are to be extended. What results has Europol achieved so far in the fight against money laundering within its related areas of competence? What has happened to Europol’s computer system, which was to be operational in 2001? What about the joint investigation teams which were in future to extend their role to combating money laundering? As Mr Watson has reminded us, Parliament has on several occasions expressed its discontent at the lack of any real democratic control over Europol’s activities. It has done so in the Cederschiöld and Nassauer reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we today grant new competences to Europol without demanding, even if it is in this debate, a revision of Article 31 of the Convention, which limits Parliament’s role to that of being the recipient of an annual report? Should Europol’s funding not be included within the general budget of the European Union, as we have already requested? And should Parliament not be consulted on the appointment of the director of Europol? The same occurs with the lack of jurisdictional control – and later we are going to see the report on Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe this report is meaningless unless it is taken as one more opportunity for Parliament to reconsider voting on the lawful extension of Europol’s terms of reference, on the whole operation of this body, its effectiveness, the ways it can be controlled, the chance to appraise its successes and progress. We are dealing with nothing less than the future of police cooperation in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In dealing with these matters, our rapporteurs have centred their considerations both on the Protocol amending the Europol Convention and on improving mutual assistance. We can but congratulate them on their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our primary concern, however, relates to the extension of Europol’s competences. We agree that there is an express and urgent need for effective judicial cooperation, but, at the same time, denounce a shift that contains the seeds of a Europol set up outside the control of Parliament or of any legal authority, and, in more general terms, a democratic deficit in a Europe that the Member States insist in confining to the misty realms of intergovernmental procedures, thus skirting the obligations, duties and control that derive from universal suffrage.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see grey areas regarding Europol: the diplomatic immunity of its members, no definition of authorised resources nor of the limits on these, notifications of the filing of personal records, filing of records in areas protected by international texts and declarations of human rights, threats to freedoms given the risk of their being abused, now or in the future, following the kind of political changes liable to be seen in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Were the European police force to be offered this heaven-sent chance of potential self-regulation, it would do its utmost to curb the European Parliament’s vague desire for democratic control, given the current deficiencies at organisational level and the lack of unity on the background issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese initiative concerning the Europol Convention is intended to spur the European Parliament into choosing the right route to ensuring security, with this hingeing around a discretionary filing of records on citizens in all the areas affecting their private lives. Of course, we must identify, prosecute and sentence people who launder dirty money on behalf of terrorists, arms dealers and drug traffickers. But this will not provide us with firmer guarantees on the right of defence and the protection of citizens’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we are tabling amendments on the strengthening of these rights and freedoms, on the need to adopt an instrument, on the right of defence, and on the recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not escaped our notice that one of the articles in the Council Act, which has curiously not been commented on, stipulates that Europol is to specify whether data relating to ethnic origin, religious or other types of beliefs, political leanings, sexual tendencies or health can be included in the data records.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we going to equivocate any longer over Europol’s competences when the very notion of democratic control has been struck off the statute book? The democratic values that everyone in this Chamber shares must be the very ones that govern our deeds and works, in order to forge a European Union based on solidarity and social commitment and not on policing and repression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that his analysis is extremely accurate and shows us how we really can make headway in combating the laundering of what we call ‘black’ or ‘dirty’ money. I would remind the House that we aim to use this policy to fight organised crime, i.e. drug smuggling, trafficking in women and children and many other wretched activities which have a terrible impact on society as a whole, even – and I say this somewhat cynically – the economy itself, in that it is generally acknowledged that this money increases the money supply and often destabilises monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is quite right in saying – and I too should like to say – that, having opened our borders, albeit for other reasons, to organised criminals, we must also open our borders to the bodies – i.e. the police and the courts – responsible for pursuing them. And, of course, we must do so on the basis of a common definition of what crime is and of what methods it uses, so that it cannot flee from one country to another, at least not for purely procedural reasons. The way forward, as Mr Marinho says – and I agree with him – is communitisation. Obviously, because that takes us the way of parliamentary and democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are still a great many issues outstanding, even if we accept everything that has been said so far. There are many serious issues outstanding. What I mean is this: there are countries today in the European Union which tolerate or even take advantage of strange situations, offshore companies, strange banking regulations and other such things and they do not inspire me personally with any confidence that what we agree will be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Political unification, political control may be what we need to resolve these questions and, by extension, the reviews and harmonisation of the laws governing these issues. These are issues which require institutional changes which, unfortunately, not even Nice will make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Illegal sales of narcotics and other criminal activities, such as arms smuggling, are generating billions of euros annually, most of it in cash which has to be laundered. Our task is to detect, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime. We are faced with criminals who will use every possible means to avoid detection. We are at war with these people. Human life is expendable in the business of illegal profits.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to coordinate fully our approach. Crime has no frontiers. The Proceeds of Crime Act, which my government introduced in Ireland, has been successfully utilised by our Criminal Assets Bureau to deprive those involved in criminal activities from enjoying the fruits of their crime. By the end of last year, the Bureau had obtained orders and property to the value of EUR 20 million under the Act and had made tax demands of more than EUR 40 million.</p>
<p class="contents">While cooperation is growing between the EU Member States and our law enforcement agencies, the scale of money laundering and fraud is so vast that we are still only tinkering with the problem. One thousand billion dollars is the estimated annual volume of capital recycled by money laundering operations involving financial arrangements. These funds could be used in our towns and for other social purposes. I welcome this debate and discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everybody who has spoken agrees that it is a very valuable initiative and we support what it says.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as many speakers have said, there is not enough democratic control and accountability. That is the main focus of the cross-party amendments which the Committee is putting forward. We want to see parliamentary involvement in the appointments of the director, and by a majority vote because, when we have enlargement to 28 Member States, it will be very difficult to find everybody agreeing on the identity of the director. It has to be by a majority vote – we propose two-thirds – and we also want parliamentary involvement in the dismissal of the director, if ever that becomes necessary, by a two-thirds vote as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We want parliamentary involvement in the management board. We could enormously improve democratic accountability and control. And we want the Court to be involved in disputes. These things are in the amendments and, judging by the debate in the committee, I am very hopeful that Parliament will vote for them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I want to look for just a few moments at the future, and at what comes beyond this proposal. I see two signs, one good and one bad. The bad development in the future which many colleagues have spoken about – including my friend, Mr Andrews – is the remorseless growth in organised crime which we are seeing across Europe. The opening of frontiers for the single market was a thoroughly good idea but it has also helped the Mafia, and criminals from Eastern Europe to spread their tentacles across our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When we get enlargement, which is the good aspect of the future that I see, we are going to find it more and more difficult to counter organised crime. The criminals can move freely across frontiers but our police forces cannot. Already today there are about 120 different police forces in the European Union, most of them, I may say, in my own Member State, because in the United Kingdom we have a police force in every single county and they only work up to their county borders. We have far too many police forces already and we are going to have even more once we have completed enlargement, our ability to deal with organised crime is going to be very much less than it should be. What we need is for Europol to be given operational capability across frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">At public meetings, when I talk about the growth in organised crime, the response invariably from the public is, “Well, what are you doing about it? Get on with it. Take the necessary powers. Organise the police forces so we can deal with the growth in crime.” The public is in favour and – as very often happens – is ahead of us and the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should very much like to hear the Commissioner’s reaction to the idea that when we hopefully get the concept of enhanced cooperation accepted at the Nice Summit next month that we create a European FBI. We do not have to call it a European FBI, but that is the logical next step. It would have full public support and it is necessary for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, the case that this House has set itself a worthy and good objective. But good ends do not justify any means whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that this set of initiatives is going forward in a way which risks setting at naught the protection provided by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. I do not see adequate account being taken of the right of defence, as Mrs Boumediene-Thiery said. I do not see adequate account of the rights of individuals to a fair trial, to fair presentation of charges before them. Without that, I fear we are creating a Frankenstein’s monster, though we, like Count Frankenstein, seek to do good. We must ensure that as we move towards mutual recognition of judgments we are establishing in Europe the highest common standard, not the lowest common denominator, when it comes to protecting persons brought into the justice system.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of this House, I have had cases brought to my attention. One example is a person on a money laundering charge, held for 364 days in custody in Portugal without any charge being presented. When finally it was presented it was in many pages of Portuguese, with an insufficient English summary translation, even though the person concerned knew no Portuguese. I have come across cases in France of lorry drivers, held on suspicion of drug trafficking – a shocking crime if it has been committed, but these persons are held in unacceptable conditions with no effective right to a defence of their own choosing, with inadequate or no interpretation facilities, with no opportunity to prove their innocence by due process of law in a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="contents">While we live in a Europe in which such blots exist on our escutcheons we need to be extremely careful that the steps we are taking for good do not end up destroying civil liberty in some of its most fundamental aspects in Europe. Mr Andrews is right: those heavy penalties ought to fall upon those properly convicted, after fair trial, of offences of the kind we are considering. We must ensure that those who are the innocent victims – the collateral damage I suppose we should call it – of the war upon crime are not left languishing in jails, incommunicado from their families. There is too much of that in our contemporary Europe and before I give my support to a headlong rush to mutual recognition, I would like to see common recognition of fair standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this raises two important questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the upshot of the proposals under discussion is that they strengthen judicial and police cooperation with a view to creating a single European area of justice with communitised civil and criminal procedures. What I should like to know is if there is a country in Europe or area in the world, such as the USA, which already has a single area of justice and which has effectively combated the problem of money laundering, or are we endeavouring, ostensibly in order to combat a real problem, to communitise crucial institutions which are bound up with the national independence and grass-roots sovereignty of the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, will strengthening judicial and police cooperation allow us to combat the role of tax havens, of offshore centres and companies and, often, of the Member States themselves which, with their policies on transactions involving government securities, bonds and interest-bearing bills of exchange, help money launderers enormously? Perhaps more honesty is needed and economic and social measures of a different sort if we are to combat this huge problem which is bound up with the very machinery of the economic system in a fully liberalised and unaccountable market economy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, however, it is not all as simple as that. I think that this Parliament is complicating the problems instead of simplifying matters and making them more efficient, and this may be seen in the proposal to extend Europol’s powers. This Assembly should give priority to establishing genuine and effective instruments for combating money laundering and professionally organised crime. The reaction to this initiative, taken in Finland, is both unfortunate and instructive. It stands to reason that, through cooperation between the countries, crime and money laundering could be better combated.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, is the Commission’s new system thought to be needed? In my view, it is not clear in which areas efforts are to be concentrated, except for the fact that countries are to have a uniform method of protecting data imposed upon them. Or, to put it another way, the fight against money laundering ought not to be impeded by the Commission having to organise its efforts in accordance with the most indulgent and indifferent Member States. Parliament ought not to frustrate the Council of Ministers’ initiatives and the initiatives from those countries which are most inclined to stop these crimes. Parliament should be encouraging the Council of Ministers and the Member States. The trend should be towards establishing uniform definitions of criminal acts, and the countries’ police and judicial systems ought to cooperate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following Mr MacCormick’s splendid intervention, I should like to make an initial observation. Here we have three initiatives aimed at combating organised crime, a major blight on society. They contain a clear political desire to combine efforts, to go further and to develop this area of freedom, security and justice. To do this we have to take care that measures do not become dispersed, with the creation of an absolutely lopsided situation in which, as Mr MacCormick has so rightly said, one part of the process suffers. We must be especially careful with this since what is at stake is the distinguishing mark of European identity: the protection of fundamental rights and guarantees of a fair trial. As a result of the Tampere agreements, we need the guarantees of a fair trial to be developed in the area of the third pillar, and we need these guarantees to be developed when transnational situations arise, such as the ones he has described.</p>
<p class="contents">This picks up on the theme of Mr Lehne’s intervention. Mr Lehne was explaining the problem of a lawyer’s professional secrecy in the context of this fight against money laundering. Well, here we have another good example: in combating money laundering we may put at stake something that, far from being a lawyer’s privilege, is an essential element in this right to a fair trial, which in turn is an essential element in all our European development, culture and identity. I realise it is very difficult because here we have to construct something from a scattering of instruments. We have a directive to combat money laundering; we have a framework decision to combat it; we have an amendment to the Europol Convention. At some moment, we will have to compile all these texts because, Mr President, you and, doubtless, all of us here know that for this to be implemented by judges – who are the ones that have to implement it while guaranteeing the right to a fair trial – with this scattered system we are, of course, very poorly guided.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now focus on another issue, which also concerns the quality of the legislation. This report includes a recital on the Geneva appeal, and the Group of the European People’s Party will vote against it, not because we are against the Geneva appeal, but simply because as Parliament we must ensure the quality of legislation. The Geneva appeal is not a recital; it is not a legal reference nor a quasi-legal reference to a European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the PPE’s initiative, two amendments to Article 8 have been included, because if we agree on the political will to combat organised crime, we cannot provide a chance for a Member State to refuse this cooperation – we are talking about legal cooperation, between judges – by invoking matters of national interest. Where does national interest come in when it is a case of one judge in the European Union asking for the cooperation of another judge in the European Union? What intermediate authority is going to interfere saying that there is national interest involved here? Let us be clear that it is one of two things: either we want to develop this area and not just leave a fine-sounding phrase in the Treaty, or – let us bow to the evidence – we do not want to carry what we have put in the Treaty through to its ultimate consequences and achieve this area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on lawyers’ activities. When lawyers act outside professional advice, outside what is fitting for a lawyer, let justice descend on them as it does on everyone else, because their professional secrecy is not a privilege for them, it is a right deriving from the legal structure and the guarantee of a fair trial. Hence we realise that the compromise amendment is certainly redundant, but for the sake of consensus in the House we shall vote in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude by asking the Commission, in the difficult task it has ahead of it, in which it is making an enormous effort, to take into account these initiatives that I am putting forward on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What can one expect? You wanted a Europe solely geared to throwing open the doors to the free movement of goods and capital. Dirty money follows the same channels as any other type of money, even if many of the transactions made by companies of some standing are not as dirty as the capital transactions of the Cali cartel. What I am talking about are the proceeds of corruption and the profits reaped from exploiting children in less developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">You are incapable of taking genuine measures to prevent money laundering because to do so would entail laying the blame at the door of banking and financial groups, since they are the ones who are able to launder this money by cloaking themselves in banking secrecy. All the big banks themselves set up subsidiaries in tax havens, and these tax havens only exist because there are banks who use them. They do this with encouragement from the Member States themselves, such as France and the Netherlands in the case of Saint-Martin, and Great Britain in the case of the Channel Islands and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We are the only ones here who want to see measures that truly prevent money laundering, which is to say the immediate abolition of banking secrecy, the trade secret, the business secret, access to the accounting ledgers of all banking and manufacturing companies and the right of all the employees of these companies, of all consumers, to bring to the public’s attention any transfer of funds that is against the interests of society at large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a task emanating from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Summit. However, it is also necessary if we are to strengthen the attractiveness of the European Union as a location for business; moreover it is something which the public wants and we must respect their wishes because the people who live in the European Union have a right to security.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are discussing how we can take one step further towards this security union. We are discussing this in connection with measures to combat money laundering. If money is the driving force behind organised crime, then the measures which we are discussing today to combat money laundering throughout the world are part of our battle against this organised crime. If we can stamp out money laundering, then, in so doing, we will, in the end, also stamp out organised crime. Organised crime – as has been stated here several times, and as we know – generates huge profits from drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, nuclear proliferation, car smuggling and from many other sectors including, even, the art trade. All of this illegally acquired money is, however, laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy. That is also the aim of organised crime and in this way organised crime and laundered money damage the legal economy of the European Union. The economy is being infiltrated on a huge scale. That is why these measures to combat money laundering are so very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only tackle the situation as a whole, however, if we have a combination of several instruments to combat money laundering. Today we have an opportunity to discuss four such reports and measures in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to extend Europol’s remit. We know that Europol has competences in various fields, but now money laundering is to be added as an independent area of competence. This is a good thing. However, we must not forget to provide Europol with sufficient staff and funding so that it is actually able to assume the responsibilities which we are assigning it. I should also like to take this opportunity to call – as colleagues have done before me – for a serious anomaly finally to be removed and Europol to be subject to the same supervision as other institutions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation. It only makes sense for Europol to have the relevant powers if we also succeed in harmonising the substantive and formal provisions of criminal law, in terms of what constitutes a criminal offence, the severity of the penalty and the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is a fundamental one, namely that it is also important to improve mutual assistance in legal matters. Mrs Palacio made clear reference to this point, saying how necessary it was to also involve the relevant occupational groups and to make it clear to the Member States that here European interests need to come before national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point – and I think that this is also relevant – is the establishment of Eurojust or the provisional unit, because this is about improving coordination on investigations and prosecutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and we, the European Parliament, are seizing a new opportunity in the fight against organised crime, which preoccupies us to such an extent. The Union is thus laying a building block in the transition from an economic union to a security union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the United Nations, the annual volume of money recycled through money-laundering operations is approaching USD 1 billion. In the European Union, we must continue to fight resolutely against money laundering, in the knowledge that, particularly after the creation of the single market and the liberalisation of the capital and financial services markets, there needs to be effective police and judicial cooperation between Member States which is as efficient as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are discussing three reports that acknowledge the fact that money laundering lies at the root of organised crime and must therefore be eradicated, wherever it may take place. To this end, the Marinho report proposes that a guarantee should be given that specific measures will be adopted to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds from crime, requiring a joint mobilisation of police and judicial resources in order to ensure that criminals or the proceeds from crime can find no hiding place in the European Union. I agree with the general thrust of the report, but I harbour some doubts as to the rapporteur’s amendment claiming that this framework decision should also apply to less serious crimes. The aim of this framework decision is to combat the major crimes that are at the root of money laundering, not small crimes punishable by a lesser sentence, which, if considered within the scope of this framework decision, could negate its very purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Karamanou report seeks to extend Europol’s competences to cover the crime of money laundering by strengthening police cooperation and by providing Europol with more effective instruments. This is a Portuguese initiative that has already been commended by a number of previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Roure report seeks to remove a large number of judicial obstacles to mutual legal assistance and, at the same time, provides for the adoption of practical measures designed to strengthen this cooperation. I would like to see the report’s guideline with regard to the professional confidentiality of lawyers maintained, a guideline that has already received a favourable vote in this Parliament – when the Lehne report on money laundering was adopted. We also acknowledge here that professional confidentiality is an essential factor in the administration of justice, since any breach of this law could entail a violation of our citizens’ civil liberties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall therefore only speak from this specific view point, because I feel that the amendment to Article 3 in the Roure report that we are discussing entails, in the very way in which the compromise is worded, an unacceptable attack on the professional confidentiality of lawyers. Professional confidentiality is the basic premise, the correlative and the consequence of a relationship of trust that is established between lawyers and their clients. This applies regardless of whether or not there is a legal obligation, because confidentiality stems from the simple fact that the client is seeking advice from the lawyer or is simply treating them as a confidant. Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has recently been adopted, stipulates that everyone has the right to be advised, defended and represented in the law and Article 48 states that respect for the right of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen in this light, professional confidentiality is a lawyer’s inalienable duty. Where would we end up if, in this context, lawyers were not bound to maintain this confidentiality or if they were forced to become an informer rather than a legal counsel? Lawyers should not have to bear the responsibility for the inefficiency or the weakness of the authorities charged with investigating crimes of money laundering or any other type of crime. With regard to a compromise situation on this issue, there are two options: either the article in question refers to people who concentrate on certain activities and does not need to mention lawyers or any other professional category, or it refers to lawyers, creating a situation which in itself threatens professional confidentiality, however much the article specifies or defines the activities to which it refers. There is no reason to assume that, if a lawyer is acting as a financial adviser, he or she is not exercising his or her profession.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I shall limit myself to saying that the position of my country’s Bar Association on this issue is quite clear: professional confidentiality is the cornerstone and the fundamental duty of the lawyer. Any lawyer accused of carrying out or participating in criminal practices can be prosecuted, like any other citizen, but no lawyer can be forced to state or provide information on facts they have learned in the exercise of their professional activity. Lawyers are forbidden to do anything that is not strictly legal. The Bar Association has final and binding authority on issues of professional confidentiality and it falls to that body to decide whether or not to authorise – in exceptional cases – the disclosure of information at the request of the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, Mr President, I shall vote against the amendment to Article 3, even as a compromise wording for the legislative proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, this is the most vulnerable area in such organised crime because money-laundering activity is the point at which it is attempted to filter the proceeds of illegal activities into the lawful economic system. This is where Member States, through police and judicial cooperation, can act most effectively to combat organised crime. This was the political will expressed by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere European Council, in October 1999, when they called for specific action to fight money laundering. This was also the subject of the joint Justice and Internal Affairs/Ecofin Council meeting held on 17 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that this meeting took place and supports the French initiative to adopt a Council Framework Decision on money laundering, on the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of the instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime. We are convinced that this framework decision will constitute a significant advance in enabling common sanctions to be established for all the countries in the European Union. This means that, with this framework decision, we will have two legal instruments establishing, not just common incriminations, but also common sanctions for two types of offences. I am referring here to the Framework Decision on the protection of the euro and now the Framework Decision on money laundering as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Marinho on his excellent report and to say that I share his concerns that we are moving closer and closer towards a definition of money-laundering offences that must lead to the adoption of common sanctions at European level. It is my view that, specifically where Mr Marinho suggests that common offences should be defined for those cases that are punished less severely or for other illegal acts provided for in Article 6 of the European Council Convention on money laundering, we ought not to consider this approach straightaway, but base our concern on an assessment of the specific results that are obtained following the implementation of the joint action that was agreed on in December 1998 and which has not yet shown all that it can do. Similarly, I would ask the House to reconsider its position, if possible, with regard to the amendments that have been proposed for the dates that have been stipulated for the adoption of national legislation on the transposal of this framework decision. I repeat, I should like to ask Parliament to revise the date of 31 December 2002, so that the Commission can present an assessment report on the transposal of the framework decision into national law. I make this request because the new dates proposed by the rapporteur would mean that 31 December 2002 would be the deadline for the Member States to transpose this framework decision into their own national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the issue of reasons for refusing criminal judicial cooperation that are laid down in Article 18 of the 1990 Convention, we agree that they should be revised in order to limit even further the conditions in which Member States can refuse to provide judicial cooperation, as referred to in the report by Mrs Roure, but I shall go into this issue in a few minutes’ time. Similarly, I wish to thank Mrs Roure for her report on the French Presidency’s initiative for a Convention on improving mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, specifically in the fight against organised crime. I also wish to remind you that this Convention must be linked, by means of close coordination, with the draft Directive that is currently under discussion in the Economy and Finance Council, revising the Directive of 10 June 1991 on money laundering. The Convention must also be linked with the discussion already started by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, with a view to removing the right not to breach tax and banking confidentiality in criminal cases to prevent judicial cooperation in the fight against money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission’s part, and we await Parliament’s opinion on this, we feel that the decisions not to allow tax and banking confidentiality to be invoked if this impedes the prosecution of money-laundering crimes are essential instruments to guaranteeing the success of this legislation at European level. With regard to Mrs Roure’s proposal, I would ask her to consider this point: I think it would be more effective to say that any refusal to cooperate in judicial matters by the Member State which has been asked to do so must be communicated to the petitioning State immediately, rather than imposing a deadline of two months. As I understand it, ‘immediately’ makes the requirement more pressing than setting a deadline of two months for a refusal to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, I wish to say that I am aware of the sensitiveness of the issue raised by various Members about the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions may constitute a justified refusal to cooperate in the fight against money laundering. As you know, this issue does not fall within the competence of the Justice and Home Affairs Council but within that of the Economy and Finance Council. I must add that I am still waiting for the European Parliament’s opinion on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to stress here today, from my own point of view, is that this opinion must not only enshrine clear, unambiguous legislation on guarantees to protect defendants and on the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions – and of lawyers in particular– may be legitimately exercised. Above all, what needs to be stressed is the fact that the same definition should apply to all judicial instruments. In other words, the definition that has just been adopted by this Parliament in its opinion on the Directive on money laundering should encompass the same judicial solution that has just been adopted here with regard to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. I say this because having different formulas in the two instruments would only lead to greater confusion in their interpretation and difficulties in their practical application.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission is also pleased to note the support Parliament has given to extending Europol’s competences to cover all forms of money laundering. The Karamanou report, on which I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur, proposes various amendments with regard to improving the democratic and judicial control of Europol. You all know how important I consider the issue of such control to be. To be frank, however, I do not think that this initiative is the appropriate occasion to be adopting decisions in this field. In fact, the Commission, in the course of the work laid down in the assessment panel for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, known as the ‘scoreboard’, is currently studying the best way to adopt a judicial instrument that will facilitate the communitisation of Europol and not just the adoption of piecemeal measures under the Europol Convention. The best way of strengthening Parliamentary control of Europol is to fully integrate the Europol Convention into the European Union’s’ judicial framework. In the same way, I doubt that it is good policy to resort to the mechanism referred to in Article 34(2)(d) of the Treaty for the entry into force of this amendment on the Europol Convention. We feel that extending Europol’s competences should be carried out at the same time in all Member States and not in a staggered way, which could lead to greater confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament feels able to support these three initiatives, which, in fact, all have an important role in strengthening an action plan for combating money laundering. We also hope that the Member States will match these initiatives by adopting them rapidly in the Council, but, above all, by ratifying the conventions in question with all speed so that they can enter into force in their respective national legal systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
