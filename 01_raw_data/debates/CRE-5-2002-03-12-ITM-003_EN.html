<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the budget process looks a bit different this year than previously. We are on the way towards an activity-based budget. Of course, we hope that, in the long term, this will lead to simplification and increased clarity, although this year we will be working with the old and the new methods in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">Another new feature is that all three institutions are producing political budget guidelines at roughly the same time. The Commission now produces an annual policy statement, and the Council makes decisions on guidelines. In my view, this should mean that we will obtain a better political dialogue on the priorities and that the Commission’s preliminary draft budget can be based on deliberations by all three institutions, not just those of the Commission itself. This should naturally lead to a better budget process and to simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest difference as far as the European Parliament is concerned is perhaps the increased emphasis now being placed on follow-up and implementation, for we cannot merely be content to pass decisions on a mass of figures in the budget which then just remain on paper. As a Parliament, we must also make sure that our ambitions and priorities are being realised.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of the guidelines which the committee is now submitting to the European Parliament is more precise in many cases than before. This applies to statements on the importance of ensuring that the budget is followed, as well as to decisions of the European Parliament or budgetary authority. It applies to the actual amounts involved, as well as to budgetary remarks, etc. However, on a number of occasions, the Committee on Budgets has had to point out that a number of remarks which the European Parliament made in various contexts did not, however, lead to the Commission’s actually acting in accordance with the decisions made.</p>
<p class="contents">On a number of occasions, we have also pointed out the importance of the amounts in the budget actually taking effect. Naturally, it is worrying when, year after year, the budget produces large surpluses which have to be paid back to the Member States because important work is not carried out. This is particularly serious in terms of areas to which political priority is given, such as regional policy assistance under the Structural Funds or aid to prioritised recipients in other parts of the world. We have already been warned that it will be proposed that the Member States receive early repayment of EUR 10 billion from the 2001 surplus. This is a tenth of the entire budget. This surplus arose primarily because the Structural Funds did not manage to implement their programmes. In our opinion, this must lead to greatly increased pressure on both the Commission and the Member States to take the problem of implementation seriously. In reality, this has to do with confidence in the EU as an institution. This has led to our attempting to introduce a somewhat different budget process. We are attempting to bring the committees on board in a quite different way than before, for example by means of hearings involving Commissioners and through each committee’s checking its part of the budget and seeing how it is implemented. This will ensure that the entire European Parliament is involved in the budget process more actively than before.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget debate will also be a little different. During the July session we shall have a debate which will largely be to do with implementation but which will take place at the same time as the debate on the mandate for the conciliation negotiations on the Council’s first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Budgets we had a great many amendments, 129 to be precise. Here in the plenary sitting, the number has been considerably reduced, and the reason for this is of course that we have been able to compromise on a consensus approach towards the most important priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are entirely agreed that the most important political priority is EU enlargement. For us, this means, in more concrete terms, the preparations we must now make if it is to be possible for this historic task to be carried out. Enlargement itself creates no problems for the 2003 budget, but we are still affected in various ways. We must begin the debate on the long-term effects of enlargement, and the European Parliament wants to be involved in this debate. The agreements now being made in negotiations with the Member States will affect the budget for a long time into the future. This is therefore a very important concern for the European Parliament too. We must also set in motion a debate on the principles of how we are to prepare for accession. This will apply to pre-accession aid under heading 7 and to our own costs in terms of administrative expenditure for preparing for the interpretation, translation, buildings and premises required because of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgent, and largest, problem is of course the administrative expenditure under heading 5. If nothing radical is done, we run the risk of hitting the budget ceiling as early as 2003 as well as a major risk of considerably exceeding the ceiling in 2004. We are therefore attempting to put pressure on the Secretaries-General of our institutions so that they really come up with practical proposals for co-operation and savings. If this does not succeed, we will have a discussion on either painful reprioritisations or the injection of completely new funds. I am convinced that no one in this Parliament wishes to jeopardise the enlargement timetable for reasons of this kind. Changes such as increased co-operation and rationalisation are, moreover, completely in line with the ideas for which we ourselves press when it comes to reforming the institutions of the Union, reforming the Commission, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Great emphasis will also be placed on the Union’s role in terms of foreign policy and aid policy. Where these are concerned, we are this year in danger of further exacerbating the problem which dominated the debate last year, that is to say the fact that, on top of our traditional priorities, we constantly heap new tasks such as those involving the Balkans, Afghanistan, the Global Health Fund and the common foreign and security policy. In the end, it will become impossible to constantly squeeze in new tasks under the same budget ceilings, especially as the old tasks are often linked to practical undertakings involving recipients in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we have not adopted a position on the Commission’s proposal for a new flexibility instrument, it is quite clear that we welcome debate on this instrument or, alternatively, debate on a more planned use of the emergency reserve<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention a couple of different areas where we are adopting a very aggressive approach. Regarding heading 3 – internal expenditure – there is now the opportunity, in the wake of the Barcelona process, to make considerably more active use of funds for trans-European networks, for the development of small enterprises, etc. I believe this is vital. We are also attempting to press for a situation in which the review of agricultural policy, the midterm review<span class="italic">, </span>really does lead to actual change.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck. There is an unusually large number of Nordic rapporteurs this year, and the budget will also undergo its final reading during the Danish Presidency. In that spirit, I would like to remind you of what the then Chairman of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, said in his last speech before retiring. He said that the most important thing you can do with the EU budget is to make it simpler, more direct and clearer in the eyes of the people. I hope we are able to take these words to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenmarck (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, let me also begin by thanking my fellow rapporteur, Mr Färm, for his sound cooperation so far.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three priorities in the guidelines for the administrative budget on which we now have to adopt a position. The first is enlargement. That is the most important priority and the greatest challenge for the entire EU, and it is therefore also the most important issue for which the European Parliament and the other institutions have to prepare. The second priority is institutional reforms, which will become vital in an enlarged EU which will soon comprise 25, rather than 15, Member States. Thirdly, it is about completing enlargement and the institutional reforms within the financial framework laid down in the financial perspective in Berlin in 1999. We must respect these limits and manage the EU’s budget within them.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we have a deficit in the region of EUR 130 million to EUR 140 million so far, we need a strategy for managing this. In the short term, it is entirely possible to deal with this. The solution will involve cutbacks in all the institutions. This is also the most important message I have the opportunity to convey at all my meetings and in all my contacts with the various institutions of the EU. It gives them the chance to set their priorities in a way that respects the fact that they themselves know best what can be done in their own areas. If they are unwilling to do this, we will have to set the priorities ourselves but the result may not be as good.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, more systematic changes are needed in the budget in order to cope with a constantly increasing deficit. We had an informal trialogue in Madrid just under a week ago. There is no doubt that, at least in terms of putting it into words, there is a broad understanding of the size of the problem in both the Commission and the Council. Despite this, the Commission is clearly prepared to look for the simplest possible solution, namely that of using the flexibility instrument to inject extra funds into heading 5. I must emphasise that this is a solution with an extraordinarily large number of drawbacks. For all of us who do not work within an anonymous Commission but instead have to meet our voters on a daily basis, it would in actual fact be impossible to look these voters in the eye and, at the same time, explain that the EU needs more money to employ more bureaucrats in Brussels. That would just not be on.</p>
<p class="contents">With precisely this in mind, it is incredibly important that the European Parliament demonstrate firmness and consistency in its position and in encouraging all the institutions to contribute to budget reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about the most important priorities in the report. When it comes to enlargement, a number of issues are particularly important. The first is language and the right of every Member of this Parliament to be treated in the same way as all the others. There are in fact only two options. Either we must all speak the same language or each of us must be allowed to speak our own language. If I, as a Swede, have the right to speak Swedish and a Portuguese Member has the right to speak Portuguese, then a Hungarian Member must be allowed to speak Hungarian and a Lithuanian to speak Lithuanian. The Committee on Budgets has backed what the Podestà Group calls controlled multilingualism. At the same time, we urge the working party to revise its proposal and produce its conclusions in time before the budget for 2003 has to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will also entail the need for investment in buildings, offices and interpreting booths. All of this is particularly difficult as we are unaware of what the scope of enlargement will be. We will not be aware of this until the Copenhagen Summit in December. If enlargement is to begin to be implemented with ten countries in January 2004, we have an incredible amount to do in the space of only 21 months. In fact, we have even less time as the new Member States will be entitled to send observers immediately the agreements are signed. This means we might only have just under a year. A great deal remains to be done in this time. Therefore, everything that has to be done must also be given the absolute highest priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That has already been underlined in this House. In the candidate countries, assuming that negotiations have been concluded, 2003 will see the referendums being held, and, in the Member States, the processes of ratifying the Accession Treaties will be in progress, the Convention will be presenting its recommendations on Europe's future in an enlarged EU and the European institutions, their personnel and structures, will be having to make very real preparations for the increased membership after 2004, from which date they will exercise their responsibilities on behalf of a good many more people and on behalf of more Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">All three of the reports before us on priorities for 2003 are therefore right to highlight this essential task. I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for these conclusive reports, which also lay very definite emphasis on this. On 27 February, the Commission decided on its priorities and annual strategy for 2003. In it, we agreed on three priorities: firstly, preparation for enlargement; secondly, measures to enhance stability and security in the European Union and also outside it; and thirdly, on the priority to be accorded to the promotion of sustainable economic development. The President of the Commission has already had the opportunity to present this strategy to Parliament, and there will be a plenary debate on it in the next part-session, in order that we may also discuss together the consequences this will have on the programme of legislation. We are focusing today on issues of budget planning and on the effects that the setting of priorities will have on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The maximum funding allocation for 2003 has been set by the Financial Plan at EUR 102 billion, precisely one third of which is laid down as being for structural assistance and for the principal support instruments that are at our disposal for the purpose of achieving the important objective of matching living conditions across regions, improving the employment situation, improved protection for the environment and the promotion of gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the resources will, on the other hand, accrue to the sphere of agricultural policy, subject to the creation of the relevant legal basis. We will of course be presenting the agricultural policy's mid-term balance sheet in 2002, which will be linked with further proposals for reform, although I believe it rather too optimistic to assume that these proposals for reform will take tangible form as soon as the 2003 Budget; Agriculture Ministers are simply not in the habit of deciding on agricultural reforms at that speed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the priorities set for 2003, therefore, new initiatives focus primarily on the policy areas of internal and foreign affairs. The Commission is proposing to make available an additional sum of approximately EUR 270 million in the coming year, that is, 2003, for these pressure points. Let me give the following as examples of what is proposed in the area of internal affairs policy: Firstly, redoubled efforts towards an integrated common civil protection strategy, for 11 September opened the eyes of all of us to how important this is as a task for the Community. Then new actions with additional resources in the area of the Refugee Fund and a programme from the area of sustainable development, and a programme for smart energy to continue previous support programmes in the energy sector with increased resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the foreign policy field, as has indeed been our experience from the very beginning of this parliamentary term, greater demands will again be made on us. We will have to continue our commitment in the Balkans, in order – among other things – not to put at risk the successes we have already achieved, and, as a European Union, we will be taking on new tasks. To be precise, I refer here to the police operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is the Commission's view that the international Police Task Force, at least as far as the operational costs of the joint operation are concerned, should be at least partly funded from the Community budget. That, again, is of course a new step. Mr Färm has pointed out, though, that it represents a new measure, but the Commission takes the view that it should also be seen to be a joint one. The Council conceded the highest priority in 2003 to the issue of how this operation should be financed, and I believe that all three institutions are agreed in principle, but we must of course also agree on the conditions, that is, on how the resources from the common foreign and security policy are to be provided. What, though, can of course very well happen with further measures for 2003 in the common foreign and security policy area is that the resources in category 4, that is, in the foreign policy budget, will be insufficient to cover further measures for civil crisis management, and so it is my urgent appeal to the budgetary authority that they speedily examine the Commission proposal on the creation of a new financial instrument. I think we should, in the coming months, as a matter of priority, discuss what ideas the budgetary authority have as regards further development of the budget line for the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On foreign policy, I would further like to mention that we have promised Afghanistan that we will make aid available for the reconstruction of the country. This year, in 2003, and in the years to come, the people who, for 20 years, have lived through war and suffered oppression by the Taliban, will be in urgent need of aid. This will continue to be a priority for the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on foreign policy, I would like to mention that we – or so, at any rate, I hope – will, in 2003, be faced with a new task in respect of Cyprus. Any political solution that we manage to bring about there will of course need to be backed up by financial resources. Let me remind the House that the budget for assistance with preparations for enlargement includes only resources for the southern part of Cyprus and not for the northern part. This, too, will confront us with a new challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also proposing, as overseas aid, to make a further contribution to the Global Health Fund. It takes the view that its commitment to support the Barcelona process in the Mediterranean region should be reinforced, in particular by more offers of funding for the development of the private sector. The Commission has therefore proposed to the Council the significant possibility of establishing a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank, and has already made provision in the Budget for a capital investment of EUR 25 million.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to preparations for enlargement, these mean for the institutions of the European Community definite additional human resources and tangible administrative measures. Taking just one of the tasks as an example, the Commission must, starting from the first day of enlargement, audit State aid in the candidate states. We also, of course, want participation in the Structural Fund or in the Agricultural Fund to work virtually from day one, so that there is no excessive time lag. This means in real terms that administrative reconstruction must start as early as in the run-up to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore proposing the creation of 500 non-permanent positions within itself. Why temporary staff? We would welcome the option of, as early as 2003, appointing staff from the candidate countries to serve in the Commission. Of course, we have to bear in mind the constrained position in category 5, that is, the area of administrative expenditure. On that, the Commission is in complete agreement with Mr Stenmarck's report, and we have therefore included in our proposal the suggestion that staff should be made available for the new political priorities by means of reassignment, which makes it absolutely necessary – on which point, too, we agree completely with Mr Stenmarck – that the report submitted by the Secretaries-General, which is on the table, should be checked exhaustively to see where savings might be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has submitted the first such ‘screening’ and has nonetheless come to the conclusion that, in all probability, additional resources over and above category 5 will be required in 2003 in order to fund the measures in preparation for enlargement. I see the proposal that the flexibility reserve be used for this purpose as being wholly concordant with the wording of the interinstitutional agreement, dealing as it does with a temporary situation, that of no resources having been set aside in the Financial Plan for the European institutions to prepare themselves for enlargement. It is of course not acceptable to use the resources allocated to enlargement for that purpose in 2003. The Financial Plan does not permit it. I do think though that the peculiar situation in 2003 means that we should check closely whether the instrument of the flexibility reserve can be used in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word on the flexibility reserve: use will be made of it in any case, as, when dealing with the 2002 Budget last year, we had agreed that the last tranche from the specific restructuring programme for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets would be made available in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are all aware that, just as in recent years, the European Budget will face fresh demands made on it in 2003, but I note – and this is something I would like to underline – that the priorities set out in Parliament's reports coincide to a marked degree with those set by the Commission. I am therefore working on the assumption that the budget procedure will again see us summoning up together the flexibility and willingness to compromise that we need in order to meet the challenges of 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time in my parliamentary career I can honestly say I am looking forward to working with the Committee on Budgets on this year's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy fully supports the Commission's reforms, which have increased its effectiveness and efficiency of delivery in the field of foreign affairs. We have some concerns, however, for the 2003 budget. Firstly, as we take on more responsibilities and as the Council goes around the world promising support here there and everywhere, insufficient thought seems to be given to where we get the money from. If we are to maintain the ceilings as they are, the only ways we can pay for increased responsibilities are either through the increasing use of flexibility instruments – and we have reservations about that – or quite simply through cuts in other lines. How can we maintain long-term programmes of support for the poorest parts of the world if we are constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul? We must try to address that question, or at least get the Council to address it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must have greater transparency in the budget, and that has to begin with this year's PDB. Far too much time is spent playing hide-and-seek, trying to work out what the Commission is actually proposing and why it is proposing to do it. It may be understandable to our budget junkies in the Committee on Budgets, but for us normal human beings most of it is incomprehensible. We cannot have cooperation between Parliament and the Commission unless we have greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to work harder still on implementation to make sure that we are spending the money and not just committing it, and that we are spending it in accordance with the priorities which are set out by Parliament during the budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must have greater clarity in financing the CFSP – particularly the difference between administrative and operational expenditure. I would support the Commission's proposal on civilian crisis management and oppose the Council's clear intention of cutting Parliament and the Commission out of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must take more effective action in the field of small arms and light weapons; and if that is to be achieved, I believe it has to be moved into the first pillar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European citizens, every one of them, will be wondering which piece of the cake they have got, and whether that cake had been fairly shared out.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view, as a representative of the Group of the European People's Party, that the cake that is being shared out is a big one, for the bigger the cake, the more fairly it can be shared out. When theorising about how the cake should be shared out, we should, then, always consider the way we support and promote those who bake it. As a matter of course, most of Europe's bakers of cakes are small and medium-sized enterprises, which produce the cake by the sweat of their brows. I believe that our most important future concern must be with those people who work in these enterprises, and, let me underline this, two thirds of workers are employed by these firms with fewer than 250 on the payroll. What is of the utmost importance to us in the political world, they produce 80% of taxes. I believe, then, that we must get started where we have the best chance of future success. We have all set ourselves the goal of becoming, in eight years' time, the highest-performing and most competitive region in the world. All I can say to that is that we urgently need to step on the gas if we are actually to achieve this objective, for our citizens' sake.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a few crises in recent years, such as, for example, the support given to the former Yugoslavia, the BSE crisis, and Afghanistan. Now a package arrives in this House that gives me a lot to think about; I mean the provisions of Basle II. In essence, the provisions of Basle II are quite right. We have to see to it that firms have sufficient equity and venture capital. If these conditions are incapable of being fulfilled, regulations cannot be enforced. If we want these provisions to be capable of being complied with – as we all do – then we need a Green Paper and a plan of action in good time, so that our small and medium-sized enterprises will again be able to pay their wages in 2005. In the event of Basle II entering into force without our having either a Green Paper or an action plan, then, in 2005, when it enters into force, there will be mass lay-offs and mass bankruptcies. We do not have much time left to us, and action is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies especially to firms in the countries that want to join the EU; mention equity capital there, and you find that most firms do not have any at all, and that there, the borrowing of capital from outside sources, along with bank credit, prevail to the exclusion of all else. If a liquidity squeeze means that small and medium-sized banks are unable to make cash and its equivalent available, then big problems are coming our way.</p>
<p class="contents">That we still have matters outstanding as regards a secure future was shown to us by 11 September. We must see to it that we press on with security of energy supply by means of the Synergy<span class="italic">, </span>Energy, and Altener programmes. We must look to research to make resources available for the post-2003 era. Training and continuing education will demand enormous effort of us with ‘<span class="italic">e</span>-learning’ and ‘<span class="italic">e</span>-business’. The Trans-European Networks, too, are waiting to be made reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also see to it that the European Union becomes more active in the WTO. We must ensure that its Parliamentary Assembly takes on a monitoring role as soon as possible, and we need financial resources for those parliamentary delegates from the least developed countries, who at present cannot even afford to travel to its meetings. We must engage in training and continuing education there, for these are people we must integrate. We have to show them how they too can make the cake as large as it can be.</p>

We are particularly delighted that Mr Färm has supported the committee’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are somewhat concerned to see the 2002 budget for our area down by 10% on that for 2001. We believe that the decisions taken in Lisbon with a view to creating the world’s most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010, together with what will happen in this sphere in Barcelona at the end of the week, show that this is a high-priority area, and this must be reflected in the budget for 2003. We have noted that the Commission has this year attached importance to improving health and safety in the workplace, and we should like to see this too reflected in the budget for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, it is important for us also to create funds for developing the social dialogue, or cooperation between the two sides of industry, in the candidate countries. This too is a high-priority area for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to say something about the agencies. We have four agencies, whose work we follow closely in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we think it important to remember that the agencies are different and should be treated differently. They have different needs in terms of budgets. Enlargement will also be of significance to how they develop, and the agencies’ tasks will change. That is something which needs to be considered carefully when we look at the budget for 2003. It is important that the agencies should be treated individually and not all lumped together. Moreover, we shall call upon other committees to cooperate more closely on how we are to look at the budgets for the agencies. Finally, it is our view that we should attach importance to how the individual budget items are used, and there are some areas in which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will monitor carefully whether the Commission is seeing that matters are implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need a decision by the Convention to the effect that agricultural policy is to be included in the full codecision procedure, so as to overcome the separation of compulsory and non-compulsory resources. We must reach the point where we have full competence as regards the budget, including in agricultural matters. When that has been achieved, we would like to be given the option of flexibility in the items in which the resources have not been used up. Although that is already what we expect of the 2003 budget, we of course know that we have to reckon with resistance on fundamental decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the view that the law of budgetary discipline has already cut back on the re-use of the compulsory resources or their use for other purposes, so that, if we increase outgoings, we have to have recourse to legislation, whilst the resources left over revert to the countries' Ministers of Finance. I can imagine that they would like that, but that can hardly be what Parliament intended.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is always being said that a lot of money is being spent. I favour a thrifty budget, even in the agricultural sphere, but we must again point out that our EUR 20 billion puts us under the 1.27% ceiling. It is not advisable for a parliament to financially restrict itself in this way. Politics always has to do with money – I mean that in a positive sense – and hence it would be sensible, and, from Parliament's point of view, also in the Commission's interests, not to overdo the austerity policy on these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is one point to which I would like to refer. You said, Mrs Schreyer, that preparations for enlargement need to be intensified; to date, EUR 30 million, which is hardly anything, has passed through the SAPARD programme framework. Here there has been no preparation, and that is highly regrettable. Let me again mention the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was, however, taken up by the Committee on Budgets, and under which we are this year instigating an INPARD and a LEADER programme, as could have been done last year. Our intention with this is to facilitate the induction of the candidate countries into this bottom-up programme, so that they will be able to draw on the resources they need from the previous programmes after they have acceded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for this reason that I am very happy that both rapporteurs were very frank and that Mr Färm ended up by accepting our proposals and taking them on board. This also shows that, after 11 September, we are dealing with concepts such as the combating and prevention of terrorism in such a way that we are taking this matter very seriously and are making our readiness clear to strengthen our own European authorities in this field such as Europol and Eurojust, and our will to be successful through them in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My Committee saw as a second important point the theme of enlargement and the important issue of how we deal with borders in the first place. This was not just through a desire to reinforce borders. Of course, we do not want people to die at them – the Home Affairs Committee is very sensitive in matters concerning the combating of illegal immigration, and looks closely at what is actually achieved in this area and how effective is the form that the measures take. On that, there are naturally certain things that we expect of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, despite counter-terrorism and police efforts on the one hand and action taken by border guards on the other, there is one thing we do not want to forget under any circumstances, that, in a democracy consisting of 15 states, soon indeed to be 25, in the European Union, we also have an obligation to the people who travel to the European Union and live together with us. This has led us to make a number of proposals relating to integration policy. I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their willingness to accept these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Issue No 1: enlargement, which will of course play a larger part in 2003's Budget procedure than it has done in previous years. Looking closely, though, at how much pre-accession aid can drain away today – and we have heard a certain amount about this in agriculture – there are still things that must be done both by us and by the candidate countries. It is not enough to enable them to get the hang of the programmes and the management structures as well, and then require only 3500 posts up to 2008, all of which is described as ‘enlargement costs’.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, though, also to appeal to my fellow Members of this House, and warn against using budgetary sleight-of-hand to take money intended for enlargement under category 8, shove it under category 7 and fund pre-accession aid from it. That is not the Commission's doing, but rather an amendment proposed by Members of this House. I would ask them, in that event, to be honest, go home and tell their own Ministers of Finance that we need the Financial Perspective to be revised, and that enlargement is underfunded. Using such tricks to try to fund enlargement is something I can only warn against. I wish to express my gratitude to the Commission for the position they have taken on this subject, which also expresses the view of the Group of the European People's Party.</p>
<p class="contents">Issue No 2: foreign policy. I will keep this very brief, and tell you once and tell you clearly that I am slowly getting steamed up by the fact that a lunch for the European Union's Foreign Ministers costs us on average EUR 100 million. That is just not practicable in the long term. There is more to come. We are now suddenly supposed to take over further activities, whereas the Member States said months ago that they would finance them themselves. Let me mention only ‘Amber Fox’ as a key example. Now they are suddenly supposed to be funded by the Community budget, which is utterly extraordinary. Let the Council state which of the European Union's activities it can do without, and then funding can be provided on a serious basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Issue No 3: agricultural policy. I think we do not need to use the Budget procedure to reinvent agricultural policy, but I do of course expect the Commission to submit its proposals on the Mid-Term Review in good time, so that we are in a position to incorporate whatever is of budgetary value into the framework of the 2003 Budget procedure. On that point, let me observe that, as the budgetary authority, our participatory roles in the rural development programmes and in the area of traditional income aid are different and that the Commission should please bear that in mind so that it can go ahead on time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by thanking Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck most warmly for their good cooperation. I am sure that we will be able, by the end of the year, to present a sound Budget. It should not be left to Parliament. I hope that it is not left to the Council either.</p>

I would like to take today's debate on the guidelines as an opportunity to pause and do a sort of interim report. We have completed the first half of our parliamentary term, and when we recall the tasks that faced us at its outset, what had to be funded by the Budget, what was made available to us and what we allocated to others, we see that the world has, of course, changed a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to deal with the problems of the world, which are not without their effects on us. Europe has closed ranks, and we stand alongside the world. We have taken on hitherto unmanageable tasks, and there are yet others for us to take on. The field of foreign policy has been mentioned: extensive aid for reconstruction in the Balkans, aid for Afghanistan and for the people persecuted and harassed there, the fight against the global scourge of AIDS, the disarmament measures that we need to reduce not only the number of landmines but also chemical and biological weapons, and also, for example sending a police task force to the Balkans to ensure that peace can enter there. The field of home affairs and judicial policy has, of course, see us agree, in the aftermath of the events of 11 September, to strengthen Europol and Eurojust and speed up their introduction; one of the Commission's new proposals is the expansion of civil protection in the event of emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Convention, we are discussing cross-border structures and future developments. In the field of home affairs and judicial policy, we are discussing immigration and how to control it. Enlargement has been described as a problem area, and in it we have a number of things to sort out both internally and externally; whilst Mr Ferber says that there are calls to rethink the relationship between Categories 7 and 8, we must also note that, as opposed to the original estimates, on the basis of which we assumed that the first six States could be added as early as 2002, this position has of course changed, and that is something we have to be allowed to discuss. We, too, see of course that there is a lack of uptake, and, where too little is taken up, we must not heap up even more. Budgeting is not about demanding more; it is about making proper use of the taxpayers' available resources.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need, though, to take note of realities as well; everyone – including those Members of this House who even want to bake bigger cakes – has described the points we want to discuss together in order not to stage enlargement as a sort of cataclysm with the expectation of dramatic overnight change; rather, we have to prepare ourselves. We have to prepare the countries, and part of that involves, of course, our making appropriate provision and discussing it. The capacity for taking the right decisions presupposes that we talk about them. It is, in my opinion, irresponsible to simply stand up and say, for whatever simplistic reasons, that ‘we cannot even think about that’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few years, we have had to move reform of the Commission forward, but we also have internal problems that have to be discussed further. The combating of unemployment must not be forgotten; it is one of our central tasks, and one in which the cooperation procedure has of course enabled us to make progress already. We want to prevent social exclusion. We want to promote technological development and, to that end, to make promotional funds available for ‘<span class="italic">e</span>-learning’ and the new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">These great challenges, which have arisen in recent years, do not find us in a state of fear. We face this challenge with a confidence which we want to make visible. It is a good thing that this European Union of ours is working together, that we are increasingly trying to present a composite picture to the world we want to work with. We are not sitting here or standing up and simply calling for more money. We must look closely to find what options we have in this Budget. This is, of course, something that any serious housekeeper must do, but we must also highlight the fact that we have other things to do; if they are to work, if, on the one hand, the poor are not to be victims, if we want to help others who endure persecution, then we have to give some thought to how we treat each other. This is not a demand for more money on tap; it is about the purposeful use of money. We have to look carefully at where our money is being spent. Is the best possible use being made of it? If not, then we must redirect it, and apart from that nothing should be declared to be unthinkable. It is not more money that we want, but its purposeful use, and we seek the resources that are needed for Europe to continue to develop in the way constantly, and rightly, called for in all their resolutions by members of the European People's Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Strengthening the guidelines for budgetary procedure is the first step in the drafting of next year’s budget. My group stresses the importance of strict budgetary discipline. This means that the budget should not include unnecessary appropriations and that economy should be a feature of financial management. Proper budgeting leads to a decrease in payment arrears and promotes the implementation of budgeted programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the figures in recent years have been disheartening. In the year 2000, EUR 8.5 billion in appropriations were unused, and last year the amount was as much as EUR 12 billion. The situation is therefore alarming. In no way does this reflect rigorous financial management: it is symptomatic of poor administration. The Commission is unable to implement those areas of policy that Parliament has held to be important and for which it has authorised appropriations. As a result, areas of policy are implemented unsatisfactorily, while at the same time the arrears – the unpaid commitments – grow.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no such massive degree of underutilisation in the administration of any Member State’s budget. For that reason our group not only supports budgetary discipline but is also strongly in favour of the Commission’s programme of reform. This is lent additional weight by the recent so-called new disclosures in the Commission’s administration. The matter of personal accountability must be clarified and the power of decision-making delegated downwards in the organisation. Accountability and result-oriented management are the key words here.</p>
<p class="contents">There are special requirements associated with enlargement. The budget for 2003 may be the last one drafted for a Union of 15 Member States. In this regard our group also believes that the appropriations connected with enlargement are absolutely crucial. I wish the rapporteurs for the budget every success in their future work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, our group can support the guidelines at this stage, but will make a judgement on the overall budget later in the year, depending on the outcome of various policy debates that are of key concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the EU must be able to welcome new member states in the best possible circumstances, meaning that they must be able to fully benefit from the funds originally earmarked for them at Berlin by switching, if necessary, underspends from accession to pre-accession, depending on the pace of individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, another matter related to enlargement is the reform of the common agricultural policy. Instead of getting into a heated debate about whether or not to give the new member states direct payments, would we not do better to concentrate our energies on reforming the common agricultural policy by encouraging integrated rural development schemes and sound environmental working practices suitable not only for the existing Member States but for our applicant countries too?</p>
<p class="contents">The third area of concern is the funds available in category 4 (external policy). Every year we face new international crises and we want to help solve them. We have a duty to help solve them, but if this has to be done year after year without new money, then of course we will run out of money and will have to make difficult decisions such as cutting off aid to one poor area to help another, or spreading our aid so thinly that it does not have the desired effect anywhere. Surely this cannot be our aim. Also in this respect, we would like to know to what extent countries which receive aid will be encouraged and enabled to tender for contracts in public works and services themselves, so as to give long-term benefits to their economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group supports the view that savings from the budgeted enlargement expenditure for 2002 and 2003 can be used to finance enlargement in later years.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs think the important area of focus is the administrative reform of the Commission. We are prepared to allow those Eurocrats who cannot be made fit for work through retraining to retire prematurely. A sense of moderation will have to be observed when determining their pension benefits. I would also like to draw your attention to how the Commission has managed to get round the staffing ceilings by employing officials whose salaries are paid by Member States. There are 800 of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our group’s opinion that the rapporteurs do not insist forcefully enough on the clearance of the backlog of commitments that have not been forwarded for payment – the so-called RAL. From one year to the next, the gap between commitments and payments is allowed to grow. That means the Commission may well disregard implementation of the areas of focus specified by Parliament. Our group would like to see the Commission include the RAL question in the areas of focus in its preliminary draft and safeguard the implementation of programmes to a greater extent than is now the case, including the implementation of Structural Funds programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group sees immense problems with the margins in Section 4 of the budget. There are none. That is why the Commission must propose action in next year’s draft budget to ensure the implementation of political areas of focus under Section 4. While a certain amendment calls for considerable financial support for Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries, we should remember that all the former Soviet Republics, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, are their presidents’ dictatorships, where there is no respect for human rights. We also have to insist on democracy in those countries that are supposed to be our allies. Our group also considers important the reconstruction of the Palestinian areas in the wake of the havoc wreaked by Israel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that before us are two sound documents which identify precisely what the budgetary priorities should be for the coming financial year. Five political priorities have been identified: enlargement and preparation for enlargement, external assistance, internal security, reform of the institutions and reform of the Commission. I feel that we can all agree on these points, particularly in view of the imperative need to provide the Union with adequate financial instruments for it to be able to see its priorities through.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, to be honest, the growing battle against the Council and the Commission itself is not over which actions we should concentrate more on, namely combating terrorism and the reform of the institutions – which are indisputable priorities; the problem arises when Parliament and the Council have different views on how these actions should be financed, when the Council refuses even to contemplate revising the financial perspective, when we continue to treat the flexibility instrument as an instrument whose use can be planned from year to year. Clearly, there is something wrong! In my opinion, this is the principal battle that Parliament will have to fight in the coming months, a battle in which we will have to succeed in presenting a united, fighting front.</p>
<p class="contents">Then at horizontal level – to use a technical term – three particular needs have been identified: the need for further budgetary monitoring at technical and political level, for example by means of budgetary hearings; the need for the Commission to improve its spending capacity and, consequently, implementation considerably, in an attempt to prevent the creation of new RALs at source; lastly – what the rapporteur wanted to point out to the Commission and the Council – the fact that they are bound to consult the European Parliament on all initiatives with significant budgetary impact, particularly in the context of non-compulsory expenditure. On all three matters, I feel that the rapporteurs should be able to count on the support of us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a day too soon. After all, if the negotiations run as the European Commission has envisaged, 10 countries will be joining the European Union from 2004 onwards. The report by Mr Stenmarck, in particular, excels in terms of its clarity and effectiveness, and can count on our support. Mr Färm, too, is right to accord enlargement the prominence that it deserves. With regard to his report, I should like to comment on the recommendations pertaining to category 4. This section conveys an excessive tendency towards political influence at global level, under the pretext of safeguarding the Union’s credibility in the world. Is the aid that is now being proposed for Afghanistan more than a fig-leaf for the half-hearted support to the United States, which, together with Great Britain, pulled the chestnuts out of the fire? This is a politically and financially risky operation, for with economic assistance, which Mr Färm advocates, comes political support to the Middle East. The Union appears particularly sympathetic towards the Palestinians and not towards the Israeli citizens. For a start, the foul methods which Palestinian terrorists use to cause death and destruction are worrying. The counter attacks by the Sharon administration, however painful they are, are a response to this. Furthermore, there is reason for great concern with regard to the Commission’s policy. How can the Commission make annual contributions to the Palestinian Authority to the tune of EUR 180 million, while corruption is at its highest? By using racist and anti-Semitic language, the Palestinian schools teach hatred rather than reconciliation. How long can the Commission wash its hands of this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think that these are two good documents that will enable the budgetary procedure to run smoothly and that constitute a good working plan for Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to say a few words about the Stenmarck report, first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, and also to express my pleasure in seeing my idea accepted, that of increasing our use of the Internet and making this institution truly transparent by eventually broadcasting our debates, and even debates in our committees, in full on the Internet. The Secretary-General, who is present today, is familiar with this document. I think this is a step forward that we must follow through. Parliament is an institution which, let us say, is a symbol. It runs the risk of not being very visible, as, for security reasons, a subject we are very familiar with, access to our work itself is somewhat restricted, although we maintain the principle of public meetings. I therefore think it is important to use the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us say that I am a little surprised to see an amendment by the PPE-DE, I think, which is the new version of paragraph 15 stating that the administration of Parliament would be held in greater esteem if it were efficient, coherent and politically balanced. I find the concept of political balance very interesting as this basically means that employees must be chosen so as to maintain a balance between the groups. However, to my knowledge, for the past 20 years or so, the only transfers that have taken place have been between the two main groups and, as a result of this, at least one third of the Members of Parliament did not benefit from this. I think that the administration is fine as it is and that it does not need to be rebalanced by means of a system that, in Italy, we call the ‘Cencelli’ system, which, moreover, worked very well at the time of the last nominations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE, I think that that is sufficient and that we are balanced enough as we are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the application of the additionality principle, which is an extremely important issue, the Commission must establish the means for its verification and control on the ground. Halfway through the period of application of the funds, the Commission should inform Parliament about the evaluation of its compliance on the basis of objective criteria. Furthermore, we ask the Commission, by means of appropriate solutions, to support the idea that the structural allocation should be considered a spending objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the budget line for the trans-European transport network we note that the level of budgetary implementation over recent years is satisfactory and we recommend giving priority to projects with a clear European added value, stressing the importance of the funding of projects which provide a rebalance between modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament also urge the Member States to use the Structural Funds while paying more attention to transport infrastructures, in particular intermodal transport and less polluting forms of transport. Naturally, in the case of land transport, they must pay particular attention to the railways, from the point of view of respect for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, at this decisive point for the European Union, prior to enlargement, the Member States, with the support of the Commission, will have to achieve greater efficiency in the application of the Structural Funds with the cooperation of the regions and local groups they are destined for.

I look forward to working closely with him during the course of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In my contribution I should like to refer to paragraph 26 of the report, which states explicitly to the Commission, on behalf of this Parliament, that we are not satisfied that development aid is sufficiently focused on poverty eradication and that we need to build on the agreed benchmark system.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain that for everyone's benefit. Two years ago Parliament voted a series of input targets on development aid to ensure that the large amount of spending that takes place through the regional budget lines was actually held to account and to insist that more be focused on social infrastructure, and in particular on basic health and education policies. The extent to which the Commission took action in this regard is questionable, particularly as Mrs Schreyer herself issued a so-called reservation, something that this Parliament does not recognise. Last year, therefore, when we undertook the same discussions, we had further and more intensive deliberations with both external relations Commissioners, Mr Patten and Mr Nielson, and agreed that a minimum of 35% of EU external assistance would be focused on social infrastructure, and in particular on basic health and education. I say to the Commissioner this morning and to this Parliament that we are relying on this being implemented this year within the budget and we will, as we say in this resolution, be looking to build on it next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say in relation to paragraph 33 that it is a matter not just of development aid to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, but also of the funds to Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean and other regions.

On the Commission, firstly, I would like to see us having an ongoing monitoring of the budget to follow up the work of our colleague Mr Costa Neves in last year's budget. I think this is particularly relevant as we have now changed the way in which the work programme of the Commission is formulated so as to have more input from our specialised committees. I fully support that particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to join with what our colleagues and in particular Mr Titley have said so far about foreign affairs expenditure. I guess it is the big spenders from the Foreign Affairs Committee who are seeing all these commitments being made and we in the Budgets Committee who are querying where the money is coming from. It seems to me that we need a priority-setting, forward-thinking agenda, which is why we are supporting the idea of a study, so that we in the Budgets Committee should have an idea where the money is coming from.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we would like to know if the reform of the institutions has continued. I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect a final decision on the early retirement scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Insofar as the Parliament budget is concerned, we support those colleagues who have criticised the Administration for trying to suppress the EP-rom study. We need a proper resource management discussion in this Parliament, and, particularly, we would like to see a coherent, effective and politically balanced Administration. The reason for that comment, Mr Dell'Alba, was precisely because there had been <span class="italic">parachutages</span>. There is an imbalance in the Administration and I would like to be sure that the Administration is seen from the outside as being effective and politically balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, insofar as the political groups are concerned, to ensure effective control of the Administration, we would like to see them strengthened. Lastly, in terms of enlargement, we would like to be sure that in interpretation we have controlled multilingualism; that in translation, we are looking at the aspects of teleworking; and, above all, in the buildings, that we do not take on any commitments to construct new buildings until we know they are absolutely essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wynn (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I add my congratulations to the rapporteurs on the work that has been done but have one criticism to make on the guidelines in general, which is not necessarily the fault of the rapporteurs, but of the committee and the other committees. Guidelines should be just that and they should be concise. They should not form a volume on the scale of <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span>, which is what they invariably turn out to be. There are 41 paragraphs in Mr Färm's report, 34 paragraphs in Mr Stenmarck's report and another 38 amendments to vote on later on. That is my gripe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a couple of points on each report. The first is on the Färm report. The problems highlighted concern categories 4 and 5 and I would like to bring to Members' and Parliament's attention the fact that these issues were raised with the Spanish presidency at the trialogue meeting to try and find some sort of solution. On category 4 the Commission has made proposals for a new flexibility instrument for humanitarian aid. I said then, and I say again now, that as far as the Council is concerned hell will freeze over before it agrees to a new flexibility instrument. What we did propose – and what may be negotiated with the Council – was to use existing humanitarian aid reserves and to find wording, without changing the legislation, to make sure we can use them for the problems we find ourselves with in category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding category 5: how do we fit everything into the existing ceilings? With great difficulty, unless we make some radical changes. The one thing we have asked the Council to do is to try and find an agreement on these two items during the July conciliation procedure. Rather than drag them out until the conciliation procedure in November or our second reading in December, it would be beneficial to everyone if we could resolve those two issues, in principle, in July.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to Mr Stenmarck's report. One part relates to category 5, where the Committee on Budgets has created a working group to look at administration expenditure in all the institutions. The reason for doing this was to get some political commitment from the Council to do exactly the same thing or to do it with us. That has not yet been forthcoming, but we live in hope. For those Members who have seen the comments in our working documents, do not be too fearful of them. We are trying to look at things that people would not normally touch, but to at least stimulate some debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Stenmarck report touches on what Mr Elles has just mentioned, that is the reference in paragraph 15 to a politically balanced Administration in Parliament. Sometimes we vote on things which on reflection we regret. To have a comment asking for our Administration to be politically balanced would not give the right signals to the outside world. The term 'politically neutral' would be far more acceptable. I am one of those people who think that civil servants should be politically neutral. They should not wear political colours. I also believe that people in the civil service should win promotion because of their ability, not because of their political allegiance. A split vote has been asked for on that matter and I would ask all groups to consider carefully how they will vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish them every success. I concur with the Commission in terms of the priorities. I share the views of others and particularly those of Mr Wynn, who said a moment ago that categories 4 and 5 will cause the greatest difficulties. As far as I am concerned, category 4 should not contain any holy cows. It must be possible to use money that has been budgeted, and we should not end up in a situation whereby we receive various claims in the course of the year on unused funding that was budgeted for a specific purpose for which it may not be used. I would therefore urge the Commission to assess the needs very carefully. The same applies to category 5. From the most recent trialogue meeting, I understand that there is a shortage of only 48 million. Given the total, this is a very small amount. I have seen a draft letter in this respect. The Commission should check with all institutions whether it is still possible to find an amount of around 48 million that can be saved elsewhere. If this is the case, we would remain within the financial perspectives and the flexibility instrument would not be needed for the time being, which means that it can be used in other areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not, though, overlook the fact that the costs of this should not mushroom, as explosive growth in cost would jeopardise Europe's stability and that of the euro. This would happen, for example, if enlargement were to increase the burden on the Member States' budgets still further.</p>
<p class="contents">Support should also, of course, be given to agricultural reforms redirecting resources from the market promotion to rural development. A particular concern of mine continues to be the reinforcement of small and medium-sized businesses, and so I hope that Amendment No 5, which deals with this, will be adopted by a large majority, so as to prevent the implementation of Basle II having adverse effects on SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, has said, our group also wants very specific budgetary guidelines and not a shopping list. The guidelines are a political message which we send to the Commission and the Council regarding the form we want the budget to take; the more specific the message is, the more chance there is of it being understood.</p>
<p class="contents">For next year, the situation of categories 3, 4 and 5 is very worrying; we have already mentioned it: we are very close to the upper limit and in category 5 we are really above it. My group still defends the Berlin financial perspectives, but we accept the strictness of the figures, especially those referring to enlargement. Therefore, the Costa Neves report on the 2002 budget proposed real alternatives, in particular an improvement in the quality of budgetary execution both in the Commission and in the Member States, and we want to see results this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must stress that there is a lack of a genuine spirit of interinstitutional cooperation in the budgetary field. The budgetary procedure should not be a game in which some institutions seek to gain power at the expense of others. We will not achieve anything that way. The financial Regulation or the response to Parliament’s demand that the legislative and budgetary procedures be updated are two clear examples of the fact that interinstitutional cooperation is still unsatisfactory. We expect a more positive response from the Commission and, in particular, the Council, in those two areas which are so important to our group and to the whole of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by mentioning an example of the opposite: the good example of interinstitutional cooperation provided by the funding of the Convention’s budget, on which the three institutions have come to an agreement in order to move ahead without conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I will focus on the aspects relating to the financial perspectives. The 2002 budget has hardly begun to be implemented and we are already preparing for the launch of the 2003 budget and we can see that many of the problems of the last three financial years are reappearing, perhaps even in a more serious form.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial perspectives are even less sufficient for the requirements. An exponential increase in activities is expected within a financial framework which has seen hardly any arithmetical growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on this issue, the great innovation of the 2003 procedure is that heading 5 – administrative expenses – is also bursting at the seams. In 1999, when we negotiated the current interinstitutional agreement, we managed to modify the figures in heading 5, but with perspectives which, as a result of shortsightedness, are now insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The general forecasts, including those of the Council, exceed the ceiling of the financial perspectives by EUR 125 million, with the contribution of a growth of 9% for the budget of the Council, which will now ask for cuts, while criticising the bad execution of some policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to avoid cheap demagoguery, amongst other things, because there are no vast numbers of officials in Brussels, where the number of bureaucrats is less than those in the municipal authorities of Berlin, Stockholm or Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">Heading 4 – external policy – is still inevitably doomed to failure. Every year we have forced the flexibility instrument in order to implement external policy. Now we are attaching increasing importance to the fight against poverty, which is a great thing, but which is essentially, in the current context, a reflection of the bad conscience of the wealthy Europeans, but we are not implementing external policy. And that is an issue of enormous concern to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, heading 7 poses a serious problem which is very easy to understand. Heading 7 – pre-accession – since 2002 only had to assist the five countries which were not then Members. And now, Mr President, we have ten candidate countries which are sharing the money intended for five, without taking account of the fact that Malta and Cyprus, on a whim of the Council, come within heading 4.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this should be reviewed, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore want primarily to set out the concerns behind the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's amendments to this report by Mr Färm, whom I will take this opportunity of warmly thanking for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are not discussing the 2003 budget, but the budget guidelines which express our fundamental thinking, and I am here to present that of my group in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, we want, in the first instance, resources from Chapters B1-1 to B1-4 to be capable of being carried over individually to the following year. In the long term, though, we also want compulsory and non-compulsory resources to be able to be carried over, something that presupposes Parliament's right of codecision in agricultural matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have a further demand with regard to the increase in the flexibility reserves with a view to potential crises and emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, even though the majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted differently on this point, we are opposed to the introduction of the INPARD programme, which will lead only to a further fragmentation of the resources, demand for which on the part of the candidates for accession has been slack. A supplementary programme of this sort will, moreover, bring only additional bureaucracy in its train.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, and – for us – most importantly, the 2003 Budget is not to be used to prejudge the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. In this report, we do not want agricultural reform right now. What we need is a further development of European agricultural policy. The resolutions on Agenda 2000 are for us the binding foundation. The agricultural budget must not become a quarry for every kind of desirable commodity, but must set forth a reliable agricultural policy option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, it is disappointing that the report on the other institutions does not really grasp this challenge and, I believe, has missed an opportunity to build on the reform agenda that Parliament had embarked upon in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three main issues I wish to touch briefly on. Firstly, I am concerned about the lack of perspective and the narrowness of the focus. There is far too much concentration on Parliament, and the other institutions do not appear to merit much comment. I understand that the rapporteur did not have an opportunity to visit Luxembourg before the vote in the Committee on Budgets; that might explain the lack of emphasis. I hope this is not seen as a negative message by them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is imperative that we iron out some of the contradictions and inconsistencies in the report. With reference to staffing, the report calls for a politically balanced Administration. This is a ludicrous statement and I completely disagree with what Mr Elles said earlier. My understanding of the Executive of this and of many other Parliaments across the world is that the Administration is generally neutral. I have grave concerns about what has been suggested and the implication that the Administration is not neutral or that it should not be, and I shudder to think of the consequences of this. Are we really going to ask the staff to tick a political affiliation box before they are appointed to a new job? Even more fundamentally, this runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis that the Committee on Budgets has put in this report, on the staff appointment or promotion always being based on ability and merit. That is the principle I wholeheartedly support. Therefore, I would urge the rapporteur to distance himself from such negative statements. These sentiments, if carried, will be to the detriment of the standing of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with respect to the freelancing of translation and interpreters, I have no problems with improving efficiency and exploring ways to achieve this, but the statement we have here is an ideological standpoint with no evidence to support the assertion that freelance translation will be more cost-effective and of the quality required to meet Members' needs. This also runs in direct contradiction to the emphasis in the report on developing the Podestà report further with regard to the linguistic regime for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, we are interested in working in cooperation with the rapporteur at the next stage when we get to estimates, to strengthen the report and to achieve consensus in this key budget area. However, cooperation is only achievable if it is a two-way process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as the PPE-DE’s shadow rapporteur for fisheries, I do regret that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has not decided to issue a report on the fisheries budget at this stage. I should still like to highlight a few salient points which will prove important in future discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2002 was marked by the failure of the fisheries agreements with Morocco. As a result, less than EUR 200 million were set aside for the regions in Spain and Portugal. On that basis, it was decided to take 243 vessels out of circulation. For the 2003 budget, it is important to find out whether this is actually being done, whether this is being monitored and how the Commission reports to Parliament on that score. Why? Because the 2003 fisheries budget will be based on this year’s Green Paper and because the discussion about future fisheries policy will be concluded this year. It is very likely that the Green Paper will be a painful document, considering the situation of cod fishing in Scotland and the far-reaching implications of that. Some form of restructuring will be needed there. It is also important to find out how the programme in Spain and Portugal will be implemented in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As a second point we also have, when we consider biodiversity, the problems in aquaculture. Here too, it will be necessary to examine the budget very closely and to assess to what extent it can be used for this purpose. This is also in anticipation of the discussion on the Green Paper and the implementation of existing programmes. On that basis, it is important for the Commission to take elements of this kind into consideration, to link the 2003 budget to the Green Paper and particularly to make political choices in that area, also with regard to the budget. This will be the PPE-DE’s main issue and line of thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Färm on the part of the report which concerns internal policies, which includes a clear, explicit reference to policies for the elderly, who represent an increasingly significant proportion of our society. The report rightly focuses on both social integration and the importance of ensuring dynamic economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to draw your attention to and focus on a different matter. I refer to Argentina, a country which does not currently appear to be following the path of economic growth that we are but which merits a special effort on our part. Argentina’s current situation raises disturbing questions regarding the future of the country, a land of immigration which, in the past, has absorbed thousands upon thousands of citizens from all over Europe. I feel that, not least in order to prevent the crisis spreading to the neighbouring countries, the European Union needs to give a specific sign of its commitment. I have tabled an amendment to that effect together with Mr Naranjo Escobar, which I hope the House will adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Stenmarck report, I would like to thank its author for incorporating so accurately the sense of controlled multilingualism, that is the need to balance the requirement that all the Members should be able to express themselves in their own language with indisputable budgetary requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, one more point: there is a phrase which should perhaps be expressed differently. I refer to that part which states that the administration must be ‘politically balanced’. In my opinion, the expression ‘politically neutral’ would certainly have been much more acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports by Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck reflect Parliament’s concerns and priorities in relation to these issues and I therefore join in congratulating them on their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary guidelines must be based on elements which are of interest to the citizens: the objective of full employment and the Union’s solidarity policies. And, before mentioning other aspects, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her expressed commitment for 2003 to fund the last stage of the structuring programme for the fishing fleets. The budget for 2003 faces difficulties similar to those of recent years and rather more serious in the field of administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Union’s commitments in external aid and the continuous demands of the security and defence policy must receive a budgetary response compatible with the rights of Parliament and the financial framework in force. In this respect, we must carefully analyse the Commission’s proposal on the creation of a new budgetary mechanism to confront the implications of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of management we may come across difficulties in payments, despite the fact that year after year we have a surplus. It is therefore necessary to have detailed knowledge of the final amount resulting from the non-execution of the spending commitments and, likewise, to know the evaluations necessary in the medium term of the multiannual commitments of policies funded by means of heading 3. This could provide us with a margin for flexibility in order to more efficiently adapt political priorities to the available resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would point out that the citizens have offered an historic example of confidence by accepting the euro without hesitation and they have shown us the way forward. The Union’s budget must reflect this confidence and contribute to strengthening the policies of the States aimed at full employment, solidarity and economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the issue of the low take-up of resources in the last two years of the structural policy. Mr Puerta had called for the Commission to be constantly giving information about the use to which Structural Fund resources are put. Let me again point out that the Commission supplies information on this to the Committee on Budgets and to the Committee on Budgetary Control on a weekly basis. The Structural Fund stipulates that the Member States must be reimbursed in respect of the resources provided by them; if the implementation of the Structural Fund in the Member States is held up, we cannot of course carry out the refund. It is with regret that we note here that the new Structural Fund programmes have taken longer to implement than the Financial Perspective had originally envisaged. I see the consequence of that as being that the next Financial Perspective will require the Council's and Parliament's decisions to be produced earlier in order to guarantee better implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of bottlenecks in individual categories, I would just like to point out that the European budget for 2002 faces us with a situation which is out of the ordinary and will assuredly not continue in the coming years. The fact is that this year we are far, far below what financial planning estimated, to the tune of EUR 4.6 billion below it! None of the Member States comes near matching us on budgetary discipline of that sort.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year, then, we will need more resources for the Structural Fund, as the Member States are demanding that all the programmes should run for longer, something which should actually have been concluded a long time ago, and hence the situation will look rather different. It is, despite that, possible to state already that the Agricultural Policy will probably not require all the resources estimated. This means that economies are to be reckoned with. Budget technique does not, unfortunately, make it possible to use savings in any one sector to fund new foreign policy requirements or the preparation of the institutions for enlargement. Such a redirection is not possible, and the only means available to us is the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to enlargement, I would once again like to clarify that what financial planning provided for the financing of new Member States in 2003 was provided exclusively for that purpose. We cannot redirect that, and also reject the option of doing so, but we do have the flexibility instrument. Let me again point out that, as soon as enlargement is completed, new resources will be allocated to administration. It is only for the preparations that they have not been set aside. If enlargement is to be successfully handled, though, preparations for it will be of fundamental importance, and they must be made in 2003 by all the institutions – Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, and by the Commission as well. We are not talking here about excessive sums of money, but in terms of amounts that would still leave room in the flexibility reserve for other measures. We should subject this instrument to serious testing in this respect. It is the citizens of the new Member States, above all, who are entitled to European institutions that are prepared and ready to make a success of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
