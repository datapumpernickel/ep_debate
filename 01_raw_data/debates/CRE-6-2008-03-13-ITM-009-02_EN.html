We are just the opposite! We are friends of Russia, we are concerned about democracy and the rule of law in this important European country. We protest vehemently against the imprisonment of opposition activists who did no more than draw attention to a fact that has been noted by all international institutions, namely that the presidential elections in Russia were extremely unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for the immediate release of the opposition activists and of others who have been held in prisons and work camps for a long time, like the so-called Yukos prisoners Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and I support Chancellor Merkel’s call for the two men finally to be released.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, be quite clear about one thing. The newly elected President of Russia has the unique opportunity to make a new beginning, to move towards democracy and the rule of law and towards a less nationalistic and aggressive foreign policy. That means, however, that he will have to extricate himself from the coils of Gazprom and free himself from the Putin system; sadly, there is not the least indication of that.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is our duty to voice honest criticisms. It is not those who, like former German Chancellor Schröder, sing the praises of the Putin system and allow themselves to become involved in the propaganda and in the economic and nationalistic interests of that system, who are Russia’s friends; no, Russia’s friends support the human and civil rights of the Russian people, who have a chance of democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">If we remain silent, the small seeds of democracy and the rule of law that President Yeltsin sowed and that President Putin has endangered will finally be suffocated, and that cannot be in the interest of Europe or in the interest of the Russian people.</p>

<p class="contents">In recent years significant changes have been occurring in Russia, from Stalinist Communism to the beginnings of liberal capitalism; from the nuclear threat of the Cold War to the initiation of friendly disarmament and military cooperation talks with the West. At the same time, more democratic reforms in the country have been instituted and the standard of living of the Russian people has been increasing steadily.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome these changes and must support them. We do not always have to be critical of the bad things; we sometimes have to condone and support the good things. In this way, we will not only be objective but we will encourage changes for the better to a faster and greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">With these thoughts in mind, and looking at the recent presidential elections in Russia, we have to say that these were held in a more democratic fashion than previously, although there was still the problem of unequal access of candidates to the media. But, let us be honest, is this a problem we do not have ourselves in the EU Member States? Unfortunately, we do.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the elections, there were protests in the streets. It was reported that some of these protests were met with disproportionate force by the Russian police. Can we honestly say that our own police forces in EU Member States or candidate member states are angels and do not sometimes – more often than we would like – use disproportionate force?</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we condemn the unfair treatment of candidates by the Russian state-run media; yes, we condemn the undue use of force by the Russian police against protesters, but we do so in exactly the same way and with the same spirit as we would when dealing with similar happenings in any other country or union of countries, including our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not the author of this resolution and my group did not co-sign the resolution. The reason why my group did not do so is not to avoid having a discussion today. It is not because we think that we do not need to discuss these matters and not because we think there are no problems in Russia, nor is it because we think we do not need to address the implications of the Russian presidential elections, but rather it is because we strongly believe that, when we are dealing with Russia – a world player, a member of the UN Security Council and one of the major partners of the EU – we need an extensive and well-prepared plenary debate to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is not only a close neighbour for us, it is also a strategic partner. We want to have a broad debate on our relationship where all significant issues will be addressed, from trade to investment – which is booming – and energy, democracy, and also human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many different opinions on Russia, but I think everybody agrees that Russia is a key partner for us in tackling regional conflicts and global challenges, and that much remains to be done to develop the full potential of our relationship. We need to be able to have an extensive exchange of views in this House, but also with the Commission and Council, on how to formulate a pragmatic approach cooperating in issues where we can, and disagreeing on issues where we cannot cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more than obvious that it is not possible or appropriate to deal with this significant and important issue in a time slot of 20 minutes on a Thursday afternoon, and this is the reason why my group cannot support the draft resolution and the reason why my group will abstain in the vote later on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again opposition activists protesting against the result of the election were forcibly dispersed. And once again the West is surprised, on three accounts. First, that in Russia civil rights are not respected. Second, why persecute the opposition since it is so weak anyway? Third, why do so if the public supports every government decision on principle?</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that nobody who treats Russia and the Russians like a normal society and a normal civilised western state can understand that country. The Russian mentality is completely different, as those who have always been Russia’s neighbours, like many Central and Eastern European nations, can testify.

Let me state very clearly that such methods reflect no credit on those who employ them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is closely following developments in the wake of the demonstrations in Moscow and St Petersburg on 3 March: we are doing so not only via our delegation in Moscow but also through direct contacts with Member States. In addition, we liaise regularly with Russian and international NGOs working in the field of human rights. The Commission shares your concern about the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia and the incidence of reported human rights violations, particularly with regard to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. We were extremely disappointed when the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights was forced to conclude that it was not feasible to send an election observation mission. In its bilateral contacts with Russia, including at the highest level, the European Union regularly underscores the importance of respecting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In a month’s time, we shall have one of our two annual consultations with Russia on the subject of human rights. These consultations give us an opportunity to explore general trends in human rights in greater depth and to hear the Russian point of view on individual cases. In the forthcoming consultation we will convey our concerns, particularly about the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, the problems posed by the rise of racism and xenophobia, and cooperation with Russia in international organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The consultations also enable us to raise the cases of individuals. Before and after this consultation, we will meet a group representing Russian and international NGOs which work for human rights. Such meetings put the European Union in touch with the concerns of human rights activists and enable us to exchange views directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking somewhat further ahead, we should soon be in a position to embark on negotiations on a new agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation. It will be a comprehensive agreement, embracing the growing number of policy areas in which we cooperate. As the European Union statement following the Russian presidential election pointed out, we have a common interest in furthering our ties and we hope that our partnership will be consolidated and developed constructively under the presidency of Dmitri Medvedev. We will take care, when negotiating the new agreement, to ensure that it reflects the values to which both sides have committed themselves: a thriving civil society and independent media are the natural and necessary allies of growth and stability in Russia. We have learned this from our own experience in the European Union and it is a message that we shall doggedly continue – as neighbours and partners – to convey to our Russian friends both on a day-to-day basis and in discussions about the shape of our future relations. I know already that the European Parliament will lend us its unstinting support in these efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is humiliating for Russia and the Russians. From the great and powerful one should expect more, not less. Those who condemn the methods applied in Guantanamo and the fight against terrorism, who look for the footprints of the CIA and CIA conspiracies in Europe, ought perhaps to scrutinise Russia more thoroughly. But such people, and the politicians who share their philosophy, do not want to hear about human and civil rights in Russia. On the contrary, they find all sorts of reasons and excuses for not discussing the problems of Russian democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot be content with Russia's imagined achievements, such as the fact that President Putin did not breach the Russian constitution and left office of his own accord. That is no achievement, it is a minimum rule of conduct. I am reminded of a joke about Stalin's benevolence. A child comes out of Stalin's office, bleeding but smiling. ‘What are you smiling about?’ someone asks. ‘I’m smiling because Stalin was so good to me.’ ‘What do you mean, good?’ the questioner replies. ‘He beat you didn’t he?’ ‘Yes,’ says the child, ‘but he could have killed me.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We will indeed need a resolution when the President-elect, Mr Medvedev, is in office; it remains to be seen what his first steps will be and the role that Vladimir Putin will give himself under the new President.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also of the view that given the present situation, in which democratically-minded candidates were not allowed to participate in the elections or express their views on the situation in the street with people after the elections, it is important to express my own view. Otherwise, we will end up in the same situation as the Council of Europe, which has further postponed its own report on Russia until a more appropriate moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I shall be voting, and will be doing so in favour of the resolution, the text is not perhaps exactly as I would like it to be. I believe that as a democratic institution it is our duty to take a principled and courageous stand in expressing our opinions on an important issue such as this concerning free elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
