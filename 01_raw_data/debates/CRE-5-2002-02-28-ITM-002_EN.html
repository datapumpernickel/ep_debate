<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graça Moura (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of the Culture 2000 programme has been a constant concern of the parliamentary committee of which I am a member. My colleagues and I have attempted, on the one hand, to monitor the various fronts on which the programme is being developed and the methodology or methodologies that have been adopted for its implementation; on the other hand, we have sought to make soundings amongst our electors and amongst European cultural agents and operators in general, so as to gauge the reactions provoked by the programme and, most importantly, so that we can assess its results. This legislature is now almost halfway through and the framework programme has also already reached almost half of its intended duration. The Commission will soon have to revise it, particularly in view of the financial shortcomings it has experienced from the very beginning, which are being felt more and more and which the President has just mentioned. It is also becoming necessary for all of us to start thinking about ‘post-Culture 2000’, in other words, about the programme that will follow the current one and which will have to take account of its successes and failures.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that I am presenting reflects the deeply and widely held opinion of all the members of the parliamentary committee who voted for it. Since this is a follow-up report, your rapporteur deliberately sought to promote and stimulate the tabling of amendments, because these would be likely to add further issues relevant to the study. Consequently, almost all of the amendments tabled were incorporated into the text. The report therefore reflects the many different shades of opinion that were expressed in the parliamentary committee and very accurately conveys the reactions of our electors.</p>
<p class="contents">A report of this nature cannot fail to reaffirm the high-minded objectives of Culture 2000 and its role in the construction of European citizenship and in the defence of cultural diversity and of linguistic pluralism. It must also reaffirm the inspirational and high-minded principles which the Programme has obeyed since its conception, which cannot, for any reason, be ignored at the implementation stage. Both these principles and those objectives must be seen as fundamental building blocks for European integration and for the development of the democratic citizenship that all citizens of the Union enjoy. Since these have been carefully considered, approved and signed up to, not only by this House, but also by the Council and the Commission, there is no reason for these positions to be changed. These are lines of cultural policy that are of importance to all Member States and, with the prospect of enlargement, to all Europeans. They are about constructing the European cultural area as an area crucial to freedom and to freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I should like to ask Commissioner Reding to view this report as a tool which could help the Commission to more effectively undertake the tasks entrusted to it in this field; its present tasks, now that the Programme has reached its halfway stage, and its future tasks, as long as the experience it has gained – as I said – can lead to an even better programme following on from Culture 2000. This House’s vote will therefore mark an important milestone in cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. The Culture 2000 programme will also provide the helping hand which the Commissioner mentioned a few moments ago with regard to the Socrates Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, how does this programme give our citizens improved access to and participation in culture? What actions involve our fellow citizens? The huge administrative costs and the criteria for handling the programme cannot conceal the programme's original objectives, nor should they call them into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Having read the report, we must state, loud and clear, exactly what we expect of a European cultural policy, especially in the run up to enlargement and the forthcoming convention. If you talk to artists today, they are all worried that culture will get buried under the convention, under the debate on subsidiarity. I hope it does not and we shall fight to see that it does not.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the mechanics of the programme be improved, so that it becomes a real cultural tool which meets the requirements of artists and citizens alike? Should the programme support the arts sector or work for the good of society? Given the current situation, these are the questions we need to ask when we think of the future. Needless to say, this, too, is a programme which needs to be put on a better financial footing if we are to avoid creating frustration rather than satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to anticipate the debate on the follow-up programme post-2004, but even Mr Graça Moura addressed this point because it is already well under way at the Commission, and the report calls on us to start giving it serious thought so as to avoid leaving the field open, including at the convention, to the enemies of any form of culture policy work at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">We should all remember that a European cultural policy which respects our citizens' differences and cultural traditions goes straight to the heart of the political debate. In other words, it is the only way of giving Europe a soul. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, I think that Mr Graça Moura’s report is very appropriate. I will say straight away that it deserves the approval of the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">After the conciliation procedure, which has been mentioned previously, I expressed my annoyance with the Council given its intransigence in relation to accepting the financing we requested. This means that a programme that directly affects what we call the heart of Europe and which replaces other programmes that in the last few years have been most enthusiastically received by the most dynamic and youngest citizens of the European Union, has been allocated little more than EUR 33 million per year, an amount so small within the already modest Community budget that it disappoints those of us who see the European Union as something more than solely a vehicle for agricultural and structural spending.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, we should remember two circumstances: the first is that the Culture 2000 programme exists alongside other resolutions from this Parliament which should produce guidelines for its implementation. I would cite as a particular example the Ruffolo report in which, amongst other things, the Commission is urged to set up a European observatory to monitor cultural cooperation or a three-year cultural cooperation plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should therefore adopt a dynamic approach to Culture 2000, incorporating Parliament’s guidelines year after year.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation: the years remaining in this programme will coincide almost precisely with a working period, initiated at the Nice Council, which we have come to call a ‘constituent’ period. Whether there is a Constitution at the end of this or not, it is clear that the desire to increase the links between European communities and to awaken in each citizen a feeling of belonging to the Community cultural space is amongst the main objectives of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there a sufficient constituent basis amongst European communities? Is there any cultural identity between them? Many of us think that the constituent basis should be European culture, following Bruckmanns’s idea, that is to say, a common behaviour, a similar attitude to life, shared ideals, common artistic and cultural patrimony, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the political centre of gravity at this time should be more than just currency, more than the CFSP, even, but the linking of citizens to the Community idea and the search for and protection of a European culture. EUR 33 million is a very paltry sum to finance the only European cultural programme to be implemented during this period, but we can console ourselves, Mr President, with the thought that the conclusions of this report will contribute to the improvement of its functioning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As mentioned a moment ago, it will inject feeling and soul into Europe. I should therefore like to thank Mr Graça Moura for his initiative in drawing up an interim balance sheet. This is very useful. It has become a sound report on which I should like to make a brief comment.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture 2000 has become an unwieldy programme since it aims to cover the entire field of our cultural heritage and, as I understand it, this has created great difficulty for the Commission, certainly in the first year. And although there is some improvement, the complaints keep flooding in. As mentioned before, red tape puts many potential participants off and, especially in small, often innovative projects set up – as, of course, is often the case in the cultural sector – by inexperienced participants who have nonetheless taken the plunge, there is very often the risk that they will be rejected in the first round on purely formal grounds, which is counterproductive. The criteria are often unclear, and even national bureaux struggle to make sense of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, all of us together must think very carefully about what we want to achieve in future with cultural policy, and we must set priorities for our instruments. I should like to add this to the agenda, so that we can also have an impact on the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say something about finances. As I have already indicated, I completely agree that the budget is small. But irrespective of whether the financial means are sufficient, I should like to note that they need to be managed efficiently, for a large proportion is not being spent at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Roy Perry mentioned the sum spent on olives each year during the previous debate on education, and EUR 167 million over five years is a pittance for culture. As an actress that is nothing new to me. It is all too familiar. What a pity we cannot change and improve on this. My thanks to the rapporteur, especially for his willingness to engage in an open dialogue with us shadow rapporteurs. He really was there to discuss and take everything on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two major problems. One is the material direction we want to take in the future, the questions we are asking now. That is not anticipating the debate, as Mrs Pack just said; the debate needs to be held now, if we need new ideas and want to format a new programme in 2004 for 2005, provided it is still running.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem area is administration, bureaucratic expenditure, overly vague selection criteria and implementation methods which are shouting out to be modified. These details are all contained in the report. I want to canvass in public for this Culture 2000 programme even now. Culture and cultural programmes are the soul of Europe, as everyone has said. You do realise that art and culture have an exponential effect on our integration policy and if we lose these partners along our common way, then our numbers shall dwindle and our strength in this fight, which we really do want to join forces on, will be sapped. The Sunday papers are full of articles swearing allegiance to culture, but nothing ever comes of it. I am already fed up with saying the same things, but we must keep on saying them. It is not just the Culture Ministers; the Finance Ministers also have a responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone in Europe has to find a place in society. Everyone is searching, perhaps from the cradle to the grave, to quote Mrs Pack. Everyone wants to feel at home in our European society, to recognise themselves in the reflection of European society which art and culture offer. If we cannot manage this, we shall not mange to root out conflicts, perhaps even as they arise, and we have a joint responsibility to do so. Parliament is fighting the good fight, the Commission is fighting the good fight. If we cannot get the Council on board, it is we who shall be left holding the baby! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By that I mean that objectives are identified, indicators established and evaluations requested. Is that not actually the situation we find ourselves in when we draw up a mid-term evaluation report on Culture 2000 and realise that several problems have still to be resolved? There are plenty of problems. Culture 2000 could certainly be criticised for lack of transparency, difficulties over selection, in short, for everything related to method. Nonetheless, it is abundantly clear that method is not the only issue at stake in Culture 2000. We seem to have reached a turning point. The difficulties we have come up against in Culture 2000 – and when I say we, I am referring to both Parliament and the Commission – have arisen because we are now required to progress, to move on rather than set up yet another programme. Previously we had several small programmes; we now have a single large one. What then did we find now we have a single large programme? We found that in the ten years following Maastricht we have indeed succeeded in putting in place some 2 500 projects involving 12 000 operators. The other side of the coin, however, is that between 1996 and 2000, 8 000 projects involving 40 000 operators were rejected. It is abundantly clear that demand far exceeds what we can supply, and that the problem confronting us is not merely one of method. We must therefore seek other solutions beyond how best to see this programme through to its conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, I was surprised – pleasantly surprised, that is – when I heard the Culture Minister speaking for the presidency and calling for the implementation of Article 151. Article 151 of the Maastricht Treaty should indeed be implemented, but if you study the text of that article it appears to be an incentive. Fostering, support and encouragement are certainly called for. More is probably needed. Bear in mind that we are also discussing education today, and we know that education is forging ahead precisely because we moved beyond providing encouragement. We now take decisions. Perhaps when the Convention meets and discussions on a new approach and redrafting a number of key texts are held, Article 151 should be reviewed from a perspective other than its mere implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there is more to all this than the problems we are confronted with in connection with Culture 2000 and culture in general and which are budgetary in nature. The budget is not simply a cash register; there is the issue of unanimity as against qualified majority. Matters of principle need to be discussed. Referring back to what previous speakers said on the size of projects, citizenship, promotion of citizenship, encouragement and support for creativity, clearly, both parties should be involved. Nonetheless, each should retain its particular approach whilst working together. What should the role of Member States be? What should their initiatives involve? What should the European Union do? These, Commissioner, are the reasons why I wanted to propose that we move towards a Barcelona for culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Less than 1% of the Community budget is dedicated to all of these areas, which leads me to believe that they are not one of Parliament’s greatest priorities, given that such a small proportion of the budget is dedicated to them. We hope that this situation will change in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that just a few months ago I attended a meeting, in the<span class="italic"> Círculo de Bellas Artes</span> in Madrid, attended by cultural leaders from the Member States, such as the directors of national museums, and I am sorry to say that they were all fairly disgruntled with the Culture 2000 programme. Many of them said that they thought it was a backward step in relation to the previous programmes, Ariadna and Raphael, and that given the expenditure on the bureaucratic formalities necessary to request financial assistance, that assistance did not pay at the end of the day. Generally speaking, they expressed the feeling of being somewhat deceived.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that we need to try to distribute the available funds so as to create more support than discontent, and I feel that this is very important for the image of culture at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that we simplify bureaucracy, because everyone agrees that this was a great obstacle. We also need to make sure that there are no delays in payments, because many beneficiaries cannot cope with such delays. It is also important for us to ensure that projects are not rejected for purely formal reasons, and that we have to provide opportunities for small structures, another issue on which there were complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Surely we need something else the people in our Member States can identify with. Cultural exchanges and cultural life can bring about a plethora of positive results, far more than a disputed regulation can. The cultural heritage and cultural diversity of Europe should have been mainstreamed in Community policy since the Maastricht Treaty, ever since the word culture appeared in the Treaties. So much for the theory. In practice, the Member States jealously guard their national and regional cultural sovereignty. The Council insists on the principle of unanimity on cultural affairs, tiresome conciliation procedures are the order of the day and low-level agreements and infuriating delays the consequence – witness Culture 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget is and always has been derisory. At 0.04% all in, cultural expenditure represents a sliver rather than a slice of the European budget. It is soul-destroying for artists to know that there is a 90% probability of their application being rejected – however convincing their idea – because fewer than 10% of applications stand a chance of being rubberstamped. And it is not much fun for us Members of the European Parliament to keep dashing hopes as we turn down applicants by the dozen.</p>
<p class="contents">No one wants to rob the Member States of their authority but a bit more openness would not go amiss. Unfortunately, it is not even to be found in the practical implementation of Culture 2000. As we have already said, crippling bureaucracy and delays with payments, which are ruinous for organisers, make life unnecessarily difficult for applicants, to mention just two of the criticisms. In the final analysis, what we also lack is a consistent material concept which answers the question: exactly what is the purpose of the aid? To stage major events to reach as many people as possible in one go? Or to give as many artists as possible the opportunity to work in other countries? Mainstream culture has a much easier time of it. But the way to people's hearts is to support less established artists, networks and private initiatives. That is what creates European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the most powerful economic area in the world. We gladly brag about that with undisguised pride. But the European Union is also a cultural area of immeasurable diversity. We should be making broad strokes, not fiddling about at the edges, and not just with Culture 2000.</p>

We learned a great deal from that visit, not least that the applicant countries will make a tremendous contribution to the cultural life and vitality of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We asked a question of one of the professors at the Cultural Institute in Cracow: Is there a distinctive European culture The reply summed it up neatly: He said he often visited America, and clearly we share a western culture with the United States, but nonetheless when he went there was something missing and that was the historic environment. He said that in city like Cracow you can see, touch, feel history and culture all around. I can certainly see why as a citizen of that city he made that point. So I endorse Mr Graça Moura's comment that it was regrettable that the historic environment was not included in the forum on cultural cooperation last year. We must never neglect the historic environment in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply endorse the rapporteurs call to include our Mediterranean neighbours, our Islamic neighbours; we must cooperate with the Islamic countries. In particular we must remember that Europe today is a multicultural society. We must rejoice in that and we must make sure that our programme contains significant elements to deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been comment today, some of them fair criticisms, about difficulties in administration, but I want to cite a success story. I was delighted in my own constituency of Portsmouth that a grant of EUR 150 000 was given to a consortium of museums, including Portsmouth's D-Day Museum, dedicated to peace across Europe. That is a project that certainly has been very successful and they are delighted to have received European support. We must monitor projects very carefully. That is one I am sure that will pass with flying colours. If we want more money for culture in Europe, let us think seriously about a European lottery to get the money for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mr Graça Moura for conducting the discussion on the future concept for Culture 2000 so openly in his report and express my support to him for doing so. My question is, is it right, given that we have so little money, to promote big projects first and foremost. Surely we should also be prepared to integrate small networks, which can inject momentum, and exponential momentum at that, into the concept for the follow-up programme? That is what I am in favour of and I should like us to put proper funding in place and, at the same time, develop the programme so that there is less red tape and more opportunity for smaller groups to participate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report, though, shows just as clearly that this programme is marked by a disparity between the wealth of its objectives on the one hand and the astonishing poverty of its budget on the other. The rapporteur is right to highlight the explicit recognition of culture as an economic factor and also as a factor in social integration and citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">As with so many other programmes, for example, within the regional policy framework – which is not to excuse it – it cannot but be noted that the first two years were characterised by the late appearance of calls for proposals. Indeed, I will at this point use the same words as the rapporteur, who speaks of ‘chaotic programme management’, in these first two years. At the end of the day, Culture 2000's low level of implementation during its first year of operation can be attributed to that and to lengthy and cumbersome internal procedures. This is where, in my view, the Commission has to make real efforts to shorten the cycle of the projects and guarantee the programme's continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to pick out from this report's Explanatory Statement a question that particularly interests me as a regional politician and put it to the Commission. It is this: How can the necessary complementarity and coordination be established between Culture 2000 and the resources of the Structural Funds allocated to culture in the Member States? That might be an interesting angle, and one to which we might give some thought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The programme was set up on 14 February 2000 and has therefore just celebrated its second birthday. It is still in its infancy but enough experience has already been gained to provide the basis for an initial assessment. It emerges from this report that there are a number of points on which Parliament agrees with the Commission, even though we do not always explain conclusions regarding the current programme in the same way. In addition, I have made a note of some useful guidelines for the future and I would like to thank Parliament for these.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, it has emerged that Culture 2000 is a difficult programme to manage. This is certainly the case and must be recognised. Further, as you have stated, there is a mismatch between the number of objectives agreed and the level of the budget. I am sure the House recalls the battle Parliament had to fight, not against Ministers for Culture but against Ministers in charge of budgets. The latter did not wish to award funds to culture. How can one hope to manage a thousand fine ideas, all perfectly feasible in the field, when there is only enough funding for three? That particular circle cannot be squared, and unfortunately this is the situation we are in regarding this project. I have to say to all those who are concerned that we have not spent the money, that the money certainly has been well spent, down to the last euro. There is nothing left in the kitty. The reason for this is that if we did not spend what little we do have available, requests for additional funding could not be justified. All that could be spent has been spent, and we have still fallen far short of satisfying all the needs identified by the world of culture. I am not referring to a wish list, but to genuine needs.</p>
<p class="contents">You are doubtless also aware that there is scope for the programme to cater for a wide range of new beneficiaries, as soon as they are in a position to develop cultural actions and to set up a project. To give you an example, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of a single call for proposals, a dance company might find itself competing with a chamber of commerce or a tourist office. That is what openness is all about, that is what is happening in the field. One should perhaps consider whether to continue in this way or restrict the opportunities for involvement. It is also worth recalling that between 2000 and 2001 the programme was extended to a further nine countries. Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia participated in it for the first time. Sixty cultural operators from these countries were chosen to be organisers or joint organisers in 2001. This represents 12% of the total. Clearly therefore, enlargement really is happening at cultural level. These are not fine words. It is what is actually happening in the field. Slovenia was added to the list this year, bringing the number of participating countries to 28. I should emphasise that the countries joining us do not represent a problem. On the contrary, they enrich us a great deal. I always ask cultural operators from the existing Member States to extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to potential partners in accession countries, so they can experience for themselves what the Europe of cultural cooperation is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out the efforts made by the Commission to improve the management of the programme. These efforts have borne fruit, because the selection process is now swifter. The call for proposals for the year 2002 was published on 15 August 2001. It will therefore be possible to publish final selection results in early spring. We believe that is entirely reasonable. The reason why this was not the case from the outset was merely that a significant delay was experienced in launching the programme. The delay was neither of the Commission’s making, nor of the European Parliament’s.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for firmer guidelines and better focusing on objectives has also been highlighted. You are quite right. I believe that things have been firmed up and criteria set and published for the next three years, from 2002 to the end of the programme. We were indeed forced to adjust our approach in formulating calls for proposals, whilst remaining in line with the decisions in the framework programme. This was because of the management problems I referred to and because of the increased number of new participants in the programme. Initial results of this new approach show that priority issues, whilst they retain their priority, only represent 48% of all projects under Action I, and 58% of the total for Action II. Prioritising did not therefore exclude other types of Community finance, and the scope for cooperation was not curtailed. In fact the opposite proved the case. We witnessed the emergence of new operators and new beneficiaries. This is essential to develop and energise a European area of cultural cooperation, and to breathe life into it. I believe we are all agreed that in principle at least there should be no acquired rights, so the same recipients continue receiving subsidies. We would like a changeover. If that is indeed our wish and we act accordingly, we must accept the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We observed that several of your concerns mirror those voiced by the operators on the occasion of their Forum on 21 and 22 November 2001. The operators expressed reservations concerning retaining priorities by artistic domain. We therefore propose to work together on new approaches for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of the Committee on Culture and the rapporteur also called for better communication regarding the programme and the projects supported. I am pleased to inform you that the new culture portal will be launched in a few weeks’ time, at the next informal meeting of Culture Ministers. We fully intend to develop different methods of communication regarding the programme. A newsletter will be launched and you should start receiving it shortly. I should also like to inform the Chairman of the Committee on Culture that I intend to wait on the committee to present the new portal myself. I shall also personally present it to the Ministers for Culture in the near future. All selection results will, of course, be made available on the Internet too.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards suggestions for the future, I should first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, for encouraging us to look to the future. If things are not to everyone’s satisfaction at present, we should not focus on criticising the past. Instead, we should work on decisions aimed at improving matters in the future or even bringing about major changes. In my view, there is scope for considerable debate for example on how best to focus on objectives, and on the need to ensure genuine European added value. There is also the issue of how culture has a bearing on all other Community policies, including those policies whose implementation is solely within the competence of the Member States. I have the structural funds, particularly, in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I should like to emphasise something I hope is very clear, namely that the cultural dimension is not isolated and is not enshrined solely in the Culture 2000 programme. We are not concerned with supporting culture in isolation, rather with developing a mentality which will permeate all the European Union’s actions, regardless of their classification: financial, cultural, or economic. We are engaged in creating a genuine common cultural area, as Mr Graça Moura states in the preamble. We hope to imbue all the actions supported with a sense of Europe as well as a sense of culture. Supporting culture does not mean merely supporting a few players in that area. What it means is supporting the legacy inherited by Europeans, educating, becoming involved with the people, and that is the basis of our programmes. If we do manage to build a Europe where the citizens understand that they certainly have a strong culture but that their neighbours do as well, then we will indeed have succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, in conclusion, regarding relations with third countries, that President Prodi has made it quite clear that we need to open up Europe. We have opened our continent up to neighbouring countries and are in the process of opening it up to the candidate states. Nonetheless, it is also necessary to build bridges to other continents. The work has begun by means of specific programmes notably those aimed at North Africa. I have in mind the Euro-Mediterranean project. That involves a considerable commitment in the areas of education, youth and culture. All this is crucial if we are to establish the dialogue and mutual respect so essential to the smooth functioning of a well-balanced society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
