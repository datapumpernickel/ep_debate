<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mario Mauro (PPE-DE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European context it is difficult to imagine strong economic growth that creates jobs and wealth without an efficient, modern transport network.</p>
<p class="contents">The trans-European transport network plays a crucial role in allowing the free movement of persons and goods within the territory of the European Union and is one of the decisive factors in achieving the European Union’s economic development objectives in relation to employment that were identified in the Lisbon Agenda. This is all the more applicable in a Europe that, with enlargement, has gone further in two directions: towards central and eastern Europe and southwards.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, with the TENs the European Union is including among its goals the elimination of bottlenecks in the rail network and the upgrading of priority routes, with a view to absorbing new traffic flows generated by enlargement, particularly in border areas, and improving access for the outlying regions. In this way, the TENs can act as a reference point for Community legislation that is designed to promote economic and social development and territorial cohesion for the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, funding of the TENs has suffered a significant reduction in comparison with initial forecasts: the 2007-2013 programming set aside EUR 8 billion in funds for the TENs, which is a sharp cut compared with the EUR 20 billion initially requested by the Commission, although it is double the funds made available in the 2000-2006 period.</p>
<p class="contents">We have accepted this cutback and have pressed on with the resources that have been made available to us, and throughout the lengthy negotiations have pursued four basic objectives: 1) simplification, to speed up the procedural process; 2) conditionality, to prioritise modes of transport with a lower environmental impact; 3) selectivity and concentration, to promote the concentration of resources on projects with high Community added value; and 4) proportionality, with a view to differentiating the maximum amount of Community resources that may be granted in line with the type of project to be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have mentioned just some of the objectives reached by us with the aim of accurately identifying the financial commitments: the increase of the cofinancing rates to 20% for priority projects and to 30% for the cross-border sector. Thus we have a clear increase in Community financial aid for projects aiming to eliminate bottlenecks in the networks of the least-favoured regions, as, moreover, is already the Commission’s intention with regard to the process of revising the TENs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also mention the use of up to 85% of budget resources for priority projects, a clearer definition of bottlenecks, in order to allow natural barriers to be overcome, and a new structure for the European Rail Management Traffic System, which can now benefit from 50% cofinancing rates. There are also innovative new parameters for the ‘loan guarantee instruments’ issued by the European Investment Bank and new measures that make it possible to supply risk capital participation, with the possibility of involvement by the private investment sector too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to clarify the issue of comitology, by setting out precisely the content of the compromise achieved: the procedure agreed on follows Article 5 and not Article 5a, which from one point of view would have been the best choice for Parliament, but from another would have caused a further postponement of work, preventing the appropriation of Community funds during 2007, with extremely serious consequences for the implementation of the programme. Even though Article 5 applies, there are plans for Parliament to be closely involved. All the proposals will be sent at the same time to both the regulatory committee and Parliament, thus allowing Parliament to be able to carry out its own assessments well in advance, before the proposals are adopted. This fully satisfies the need to keep both the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Transport and Tourism constantly informed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Commissioner Barrot, in his letter of last November, guaranteed that he would personally make sure that the chairmen of the two parliamentary committees involved were kept informed of all changes. The letter was inserted in the final text of the regulation, guaranteeing the Commission’s commitment to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am strongly convinced that the issue of comitology must be investigated further and analysed with a view to avoiding future stalemates. This compromise represents an individual isolated case dictated by the need to speed up the procedure with a view to avoiding a blockage in the appropriation of Community funds for the TENs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this clarification, Mr President, I would like to ask all Members present in the Chamber to vote against the amendments tabled. Since agreement has been reached on the text in its entirety, voting in favour of these amendments would mean reneging on this agreement, reopening negotiations with the Council once again and nullifying all the efforts made during the negotiations, which were started with the precise intention of rapidly unblocking the funds earmarked for the TENs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking all my colleagues, and most of all the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups who contributed to the drafting of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have had to modify the Commission’s initial proposal of 2004, which was drawn up on the basis of higher budgetary resources that were closer to the requirements. The reduction in the budget for the trans-European transport and energy networks within the framework of the financial perspective 2007-2013 has obliged us to review certain principles of the Community co-funding of the projects included within this network.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr President, Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having been willing to increase this budget by EUR 500 million. Without that support from the European Parliament, the budgetary reduction would have been even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation has been modified in three respects. Firstly, more attention is focused on the funds for the highest priorities, those that provide the greatest added value; secondly, special emphasis is placed on new instruments for promoting, in particular, public/private partnerships; and thirdly, the levels of Community aid have been reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these new conditions, we must seek greater efficiency in the selection of projects and be as innovative as possible in the field of financial engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament and the Council have supported this approach and that there have been no fundamental disagreements. The European institutions are unanimous on the need for continued development of the trans-European transport network with a view to achieving the Union's economic, social and environmental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation therefore establishes a clear basis for focusing the available resources on the main priorities of the trans-European networks, that is to say, the priorities approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2004 within the framework of the decision on the guidelines for the trans-European transport network.</p>
<p class="contents">The cross-border sections of the priority routes will clearly be the main priorities in terms of Community funding. I am thinking of Brenner and of the Lyons-Turin railway. Furthermore, other priorities include the traffic management system for all modes of transport, including the European rail traffic management system, which provides for the interoperability of infrastructure, and inland waterway infrastructure, and including the two priority projects, and also maritime transport, with the motorways of the sea, the river information service and the vessel traffic management system. These priorities are in line with the Commission communication on promoting river traffic and maritime traffic and on the development of sustainable transport in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore seeking an effective approach with the commitment of the Member States. The Member States must also focus their investments on the priorities set in the decision on the TEN guidelines and they must make use of the public/private partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament is indeed willing to adopt this financial regulation, on which Mr Mauro has produced an excellent report, the Commission, for its part, will issue invitations to propose projects on the day immediately following Parliament’s adoption of its position.</p>
<p class="contents">That shows, Mr President, how much I hope you can confirm the agreement negotiated amongst the three institutions, on both the procedure and the substance. This agreement is the result of a compromise, which has already been reflected in the amendments to the Commission’s initial proposal and the Council’s common position.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I have already fulfilled the commitments I had made to the committee by keeping you informed at the same time as the Member States at each stage of the procedure. The agreements that have been passed must be respected, of course. It is in this way that we will be able to adopt this regulation quickly, for the sake of the development of the major European transport projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, for all of his efforts. I share his desire to see the text adopted as it stands, with no amendments, and I would like to restate my commitment, Mr President, to submit any future draft decisions in this field to the chairmen of the transport and budget committees. I shall provide them with any additional information that they may require. That is my commitment, and I am reiterating it solemnly before the European Parliament this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall listen carefully to the Members who are going to speak on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, it has to be said that the Council dragged things out for months on end, and it is the Council that is to blame for our present inability to pay out even now the money for trans-European projects in 2007; there is no doubt that responsibility for this lies with the Council, for it would have been much better for us to have had this Financial Regulation earlier on and been able to take a decision at an earlier juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">You, Commissioner, have undertaken to keep us fully informed, and I am sure you will communicate not only with the chairmen of committees, but also the committees themselves. I would urge you to be as stringent in examining these things as you have undertaken to be. Let there be no national quotas; the funds should be approved for projects that are of importance to Europe, and not to this or that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than fund in dribs and drabs, we should support the really important projects; what that means is that not everyone should get something, but the projects that are of real importance to Europe should, following consultation with this House and with the Commission, be comprehensively subsidised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appeals to the German Federal Government to clarify by this summer how things stand in respect of two major and cross-border projects in Germany, or else the EU will not be able to take them into account in its financial planning. Firstly, it must produce clear plans for the deepening of the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen, which is intended finally to make navigation of the Danube from the Black Sea to the North Sea economically viable, and, secondly, Germany and Denmark must come to an agreement on the building and financing of a fixed link over the Fehmarnbelt, a project that can be included in the financial planning only as and when evidence of a bilateral agreement has been produced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As previous speakers have already said, the Council, in particular, when gathered together in ministerial meetings, is given to pious utterances affirming its commitment to advances in this area, while also shying away from doing anything when it comes to the hard facts, such as financing and, in particular, cross-border momentum, and this is where I have to agree with the previous speaker that we have to pass this ball to the EU’s ministers and Heads of Government.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we faced the challenge of a Budget reduced almost to a third, something that, as the Commissioner had pointed out, had come about only because this House, in the Financial Perspective, had fought to get something more or less reasonable up and running with this reduced Budget. We took the decision to concentrate and to bring in criteria, in which respect it is vitally important that the Commission should demonstrate rather more backbone when it comes to monitoring than it did with the Financial Perspective, on which the stance it adopted was positively feeble.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing as we do that the Commission is not always steady in the saddle, we have secured our interests by creating a 100% reserve for the funds for 2007, so we can go ahead in the certainty that the commitments once again made in this House today will actually be carried out in reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking Mr Mauro for his constructive cooperation. Overall, I would like to say that we have had constructive cooperation between the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Transport and Tourism in this instance. It is high time that we obtained this legislation. Like Mr Jarzembowski, I too would like to point out that agreement was reached as long ago as November and things could not go fast enough at that point. Since then, however, the ministers have had an incredible amount of time – much too much, in fact – and we only got formal adoption in the Council in March. By now, the Commission should be in full swing in terms of producing work programmes and inviting project applications from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the whole process that we have gone through with this legislation gives the impression that the Member States are a little half-hearted in their attitude towards these very important transport investments. This is also evident from the Council’s heavy-handed cuts in the budgetary framework, with resources for the trans-European networks being cut back from EUR 20 million to EUR 8 million. I am convinced that more resources will be needed and that, when the mid-term review comes around in 2009, we shall have to provide more money not only for the Galileo satellite system but also for the trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say how pleased I am that we managed to include new financial instruments in the regulation – as in the case of the Fehmarn Belt bridge, which is being funded by loans and is to be paid for by its users. Commissioner Barrot, you have held out in this House the prospect of underwriting the bridge’s finances for the first five years. It therefore seems to me a positive thing that the European Investment Bank is also involved in developing new financial instruments. There is a need for better cross-border corridors in Europe, and since the necessary resources are not to be found in government budgets it is important that we find new ways to fund such projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The comitology procedure was a point of contention between Parliament and the Council. The majority in Parliament gave way, and I would like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his promise to involve Parliament in drawing up the work programme. I look forward to us achieving a result soon so that we can release this year’s budget – which has been placed in reserve – and so that work can get under way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the Member States are so deeply in debt that they are not allowed to take up new loans, but are obliged instead to pay off their enormous debts, yet, all the same, many of them are dreaming of big trans-European projects.</p>
<p class="contents">What I propose is that we first study how traffic might be reduced without putting us to great inconvenience, and how that traffic that is really necessary might be organised using existing infrastructure in a less socially and environmentally damaging way. The construction of most traffic corridors scarcely does anything to resolve transport problems, still less anything to address the problems associated with energy and climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also aware of the tremendous expectations and needs in this area, which will not be met by reducing funding from EUR 20 billion to EUR 8 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">As an observer and a participant in this process I should like to thank all those involved in the compromise, namely the rapporteur, Mr Mauro, our partners from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Commissioner Barrot and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the European Parliament, this compromise implies a degree of concession, already referred to by Mr Mauro. This relates to the area of comitology, as legal studies had suggested we adopt a stronger stance. Understanding the possibilities, however, in December 2006 Mr Mauro and I wrote a joint letter to the then Finnish Presidency, promising that if the Council adopted the agreement without amendments, we would endeavour to achieve the same in Parliament at second reading. This happened and the ball is now in our court. I propose honouring the agreement, in other words, not delaying the regulation Europe is awaiting.</p>
<p class="contents">A new chapter in financing projects is opening. It involves an area in which Europe has not been particularly successful to date. Whilst I do not belittle the problems or conflicts of interest that are emerging, I believe that consolidation of transport systems is one of the key aspects of this continent’s integration. As Mr Jarzembowski stated earlier, however, this does of course mean projects of a cross-border nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were keen to ensure that the call for proposals could take place and not be prevented or hindered by the slow pace of our parliamentary work. I believe that we will be very close to the end if we go along with Mr Mauro’s voting advice tomorrow. For my part, I shall do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, by means of this regulation, we have worked hard on the substance. This regulation is much better than the previous one in many respects. In fact, it is almost a shame that we have such a good instrument for managing such a miserable amount of money. Why is it better? Because, by concentrating the funds, by increasing the levels and by creating more types of funding, we have managed to identify genuinely European priorities. We have the means to promote European projects and therefore not to be content with funds being scattered across different Member States for vote-catching projects. I believe that that is extremely important and I personally am pleased about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that, with regard to this regulation, which is going to enter into force very quickly, two difficulties remain. Firstly – I say this here, and we will see it in practice – I frankly find the EIB to have a blatant conflict of interests. In this House, we are constantly being asked to put up great walls of China in order to compartmentalise accounts in companies, and then, lo and behold, we see that the EIB is going to issue loans for companies for which it itself is going to provide guarantees, and even manage the interest subsidies! I think that that is excessive. We must keep an extremely close eye on all of this, in order to ensure that it does not help itself to the best bits and leave the worst bits for everybody else.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was that issue of the information for MEPs. We have the word and the letter of the Commissioner and very soon we will have the necessary documents, I believe. I acknowledge that. I would have preferred an inclusion within the body of the text, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a cloud hanging over this project and over the programming, and that cloud is Galileo. I believe that we must be clear on this subject. We have a very good regulation for intervention, but we still have to recover around EUR 2 to EUR 2.7 billion, and my wish is that, just as for the funding initially provided for, we tap as little as possible into the elements of the financial perspective connected with the trans-European transport networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this is a drop in the ocean compared with the estimated 240-330 billion needed for priority projects, or the 600 billion for the whole network. This drop in the ocean is liable to dry up if we do not succeed in ensuring that the Member States play their part. This cannot, of course, be left simply to the initiative of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission to take on another responsibility as of tomorrow, and one which is fully permitted by the Treaty, which provides that the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States, may take any initiative designed to promote coordination of policies in relation to the TEN. The Commission needs to take control of the policies for the overall funding of the whole project and to find a way to resolve the problems. One such problem is that fully EUR 122 billion of the estimated EUR 240 billion for the projects will have to be financed by countries that at the moment are not in compliance with or are having difficulties complying with the Maastricht parameters and to which, in theory, we have said we will not make loans.</p>

I would also like to say to Mrs Ţicău that we will not forget the new Member States and that we will put in a great deal of effort in those countries. Like Mrs Jensen, I believe that it is also high time that we put pressure on the Member States to commit themselves along these lines.</p>

Mr Mauro, I would like to thank you in particular, as well as the chairmen of the two competent committees – the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Budgets – and all of the Members who have worked on this dossier. I shall work in a spirit of close cooperation with the European Parliament in order to implement these major projects, which will require us to put the European general interest before all other concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wished to say, Mr President, and I would like to thank Parliament in advance for being willing to allow us to move on now to actions and to be able to launch the call for proposals so that Member States can respond in such a way as to enable me to launch operations as early as the autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These networks are, however, crucial to the future of the European Union, helping as they do to guarantee, on the one hand, mobility throughout Europe and, on the other, the energy flows that safeguard our independence and our solidarity. These major projects should also help to diversify modes of transport and to promote alternatives to road travel.</p>
<p class="contents">I do of course regret this drastic reduction in the budget, which has meant us having to amend the eligibility criteria. I am pleased that we have nevertheless managed to adapt the funding mechanisms with the aim of guaranteeing the lever effect of the Community contribution by concentrating European funding on the border sections and by developing the incentive to have public-private partnerships, as well as through the funding and guarantees provided by the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament must now be able to exercise its control rights in full with the aim of preventing funds from being spread too thinly and of ensuring that the much–needed major infrastructure is actually built. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
