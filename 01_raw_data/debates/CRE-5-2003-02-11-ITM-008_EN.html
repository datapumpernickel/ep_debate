However, I must say that we have made good use of this time, thorough use I believe, to debate and bring together positions between the different groups in the House. At the moment these approximations are still taking place, and I would urge that we reach a thorough consensus for the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We have used this time to inform the sectors and allow them to participate. I am sure that the Commission has held many contacts with all the sectors before producing the White Paper, but I must say that Parliament has not been left behind and that practically all the European associations representing the different modes of transport have been heard by Parliament and that many of their proposals have been incorporated into the approach we have been working on.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is characterised by a fundamental fact: Commissioner, in this case Parliament is not opposing the Commission. On the contrary, it is demonstrating willingness and carrying out a positive analysis of the Commission’s proposal, of the proposals in the White Paper, and we believe that the enormous majority of its offers and analysis can be perfectly endorsed by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">W are continuing this reflection, however, and providing certain constructive criticisms and specific proposals which should be analysed by the Commission as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a crucial and decisive time for transport. It is true that in 1992, in the last White Paper on Transport, certain objectives were set which have been fulfilled practically in their entirety. We could say that the liberalisation of transport was the strategic and fundamental objective of that White Paper: the incorporation of technologies, the reduction in transport costs, the increase in competitiveness, objective achieved, but in this war, we have lost the battle of sustainability, and I am glad that the Commission is the first to clearly acknowledge the seriousness of this problem, and the fact that we cannot afford to delay decision making if we want to be operative.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of sustainability in the broad sense, environmental, naturally, with the grave consequences of the pollution created by transport, which cancel out the savings made in the rest of industry with a view to fulfilling the Kyoto commitments, and with the impact, not only on nature generally, but on the health of the citizens who, according to certain reports, reaches levels practically as serious as transport accident levels.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the actual environmental aspect, congestion is worrying. We used to have a functional operative transport system which was competitive, but now the main routes are seizing up, cities are becoming grid-locked, kilometres of rail and road, approaches to airports, are showing themselves to be structurally weak in terms of competitiveness. And therefore competitiveness is being seriously harmed. This is not the time to give figures, I refuse to do that, we do not have time, but I must say that we are also moving in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Charging is a rough diamond in the White Paper which we must be able to cut from now on and which is essential. We must promote modes of transport which are respectful of the environment, create synergy between the different modes of transport by means of intermodality and the logistical platforms necessary for creating transport as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential role of roads must be respected and valued, the railways must be liberalised, short- and medium-distance cabotage must be strengthened, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety cannot be conditional. There is a proposal from Parliament on the creation of the European safety agency for roads – the only one missing from the White Paper on Transport – and I hope that it is received well, as well as other problems relating to safety at sea, on the railways, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the time has come for us to say very clearly that the European Union’s transport policy cannot work without a consistent budgetary policy, and hence Parliament’s proposal on the European transport fund that we need and on the financial instrument for transport.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that European asymmetry is not properly considered in the White Paper, that urban issues have not been dealt with since they are considered subsidiary and not to be subject to the Commission’s proposal, that public transport is not yet properly dealt with – and we are asking the Commission for complementary documents – that enlargement is not really taken into account in the White Paper, but if Europe wants to participate in the process of globalisation and not wait for others to implement it and, if it wants to be as viable as possible, it must have better transport. You have cooperated in the White Paper in this respect and Parliament wishes to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado for the work he has done over a long period. I believe his work has allowed us to hold the sometimes passionate debates which have resulted from the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about promoting a transport policy, taking account of new elements, as has been said, in a clear and precise way, such as the aspect of combining sustainable development and growth, in other words, the incorporation of quality of life and the protection of the environment as factors which are also essential when it comes to drawing up our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the almost sixty measures proposed between now and 2010 are geared towards rebalancing modes of transport, which does not mean running down road transport – let us make this very clear – or sea transport, which are the two most competitive modes of transport, but simply preventing the future deterioration of rail transport or inland waterways transport in the north of Europe, which are absolutely essential forms of transport which must play a fundamental role in absorbing the new transport demands, and this is also true of the development of sea transport.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a question of rebalancing modes of transport, removing bottlenecks, having a policy of safe transport – safety is an essential point when it comes to serving the users – and also tackling the globalisation which is today being experienced by many modes of transport, in particular air and sea transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis we have presented in the White Paper has been debated in depth, also by the industry and the sectors mostly affected. Also by the Council. In this regard, most of the measures proposed in the White Paper have been presented by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council. Some have made significant progress, such as Galileo, accession to Eurocontrol, the creation of air and sea safety agencies – I will talk later about road safety, which Mr Sr. Izquierdo Collado has mentioned – including initiatives on working time in the road transport sector or the recent agreement in the Council on the single European sky and the Marco Polo programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second rail package, the negotiations are at a very advanced stage and this Parliament expressed its opinion very clearly just a couple of months ago. However, other important proposals are still at a preparatory stage, such as the trans-European networks. As you know, despite the fact that this Parliament had expressed its support for the partial reform proposed by the Commission, the Council preferred to delay it and simply to go ahead with a more general revision. Alright. In this regard, I hope that the Van Miert Group, which is considering a global revision of the trans-European networks in view of enlargement, that is, a Europe of twenty-seven – because it includes the countries with which negotiations are either completed or at an advanced stage – will achieve a good result before the end of the Greek Presidency and that the document can therefore be presented during the Italian Presidency. It should therefore also be discussed by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we are also at the final stage of the launch of the infrastructures package, which will contain three essential elements for the development of infrastructures: a methodology for charging – which Mr Izquierdo Collado mentioned a moment ago and which we discussed before the debate on the issue of ecopoints in Austria – as a preliminary stage before a directive on charging which will indicate how far the Council and this Parliament are willing to go on this issue and which lays down the forms, modes and limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a system for incentivising public-private partnerships in the creation of infrastructures. We need to incorporate private capital into the development of new infrastructures in order to speed up the implementation of these new infrastructures in a Europe of twenty-five – and soon of twenty-seven.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a European system of electronic pricing which furthermore will be accompanied by compatibility, in other words interoperability of practical, technical systems in the different countries of the European Union, with the medium-term aim of creating uniformity, establishing a single system based on the satellite control systems, that is, the Galileo system.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to road safety, I am pleased to note that the honourable Members share the objective we have set of reducing the number of fatal road accidents by 50% by 2010. The Commission has just adopted a proposal for a directive on the safety of tunnels and we will shortly present a global action plan in the field of road safety. In this field, we will also present important proposals on the control of road transport in relation to the identification of motorway black spots.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these new measures will contribute to achieving this objective and they must be supplemented by measures established at national and local level, because here there is a very significant margin for subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of maritime safety, ladies and gentlemen, we have held discussions for several years, following the tragic <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident, and again recently following the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. However, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can say that we have presented a coherent package of measures which enormously increase maritime safety in the European Union, which only need to be implemented, and that the remaining measures will be presented shortly. Some of them have already been presented, such as the timetable for the departure of single-hull oil tankers and their replacement by double-hull oil tankers, the requirement for safer and more modern oil tankers for the transport of the more polluting hydrocarbons and we will soon present issues such as criminal responsibility in the event of serious negligence. We must insist on the maximum level of compensation funds in the event of pollution or in the proposals to promote with the countries of the Union modifications in the field of international maritime law, which is based on completely obsolete principles from the nineteenth century rather than the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to air transport, in 2003 we will concentrate our action on external relations, including the mandates for renegotiation of open skies agreements, which is an extremely urgent matter, beginning with the agreements with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have seen the proposals made by the rapporteur, in general terms, though I will discuss the different points in more detail later. I believe we are working in the same spirit. I hope that the approval of this Parliament, with the amendments it considers appropriate in a report on the White Paper, will help to speed up the measures being discussed, both in Parliament and in the Council, and that those yet to come will clarify the possibilities, the margins and the limits and will above all allow the discussion with this Parliament within this same mandate to be speeded up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in fact, one of the last ways out following a generation of production and mobility that has burnt itself out.</p>
<p class="contents">Who would still dare to speak of disaster-mongering or ill omens of charlatan ecologists on the environmental state of our planet, in the face of WHO studies which estimate the number of deaths caused by automobile exhaust emissions at 800 000 each year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing we can do now other than try to curb the existing phenomena of environmental crisis. What was urgent in a Union of Fifteen now becomes an imperative before a Union of Twenty-five, and any transport policy that failed to include the sustainable development aspect would be entirely ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">The threats to our lifestyle are forcing us to instigate a genuine revolution in transport culture. We have certainly realised this rather late, but now we are, at last, able to separate increases in transport volume from economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from previous traditions, this new transport deal should include environmental requirements first and foremost in its studies, place the transport-using citizen at the heart of its definitions and liase with NGOs in all of its deliberations. Increasing urbanisation must go hand in hand with improving public transport. For each new project, opportunities for intermodal connections between networks that already exist or are planned should be prioritised. Furthermore, we must not oppose this new deal on transport in 2010 with financial quibbling. An ambitious Community research and development programme must be carried out to counter noise pollution and harmful emissions in the transport sector and achieve the objectives of the Kyoto protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy raised the issue of the impact of these kinds of pollution on human health. Alarm bells are ringing everywhere, but that is no reason to simply announce that disaster is looming and cannot be averted. We have progressed from realisation to warnings. Now we must act.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from giving up, Commissioner, in the face of the ecological disaster that is forecast, the Union must change direction with regard to transport and require all agreements and programmes, and heaven knows there are many of them, to comply with environmental criteria.
