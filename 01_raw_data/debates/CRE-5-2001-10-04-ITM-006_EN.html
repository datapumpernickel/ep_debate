I would like to remind you that on 17 October 1987 Father Wrezinski, with 100 000 people, talked about the life of the poorest families and people in our whole society and since that day, the World Day to overcome extreme poverty reminds us each year that it is our duty to unite in respecting human rights when they are violated.</p>
<p class="contents">If we adopt this resolution today, we are paying tribute not only to the commitment of the families and people who face extreme poverty themselves, but also to the commitment of all the associations and citizens who stand beside them. Also, throughout the European Union, especially since the Lisbon summit, the public, national and European authorities are constantly highlighting the fight against exclusion and particularly the need for an integration policy. It is in this spirit that today, on behalf of my group, I am presenting this resolution, which asks the Member States to develop real strategies aimed at equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, housing and healthcare as well as culture and sustainable employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in this spirit that we are asking the European authorities and, as far as we are concerned, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, to make an assessment of the policies conducted in the field every 17 October and thirdly, we ask, for the future of course, that a stone be laid in the square in front of the European Parliament in Brussels in honour of the victims of poverty like those laid in the squares at the Trocadero in Paris, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, in Berlin, Rome and at the UN. It is a simple but nevertheless important tribute that we want to pay today by putting forward this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps it would be possible, following the vote, to merge the two texts, because they are practically the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of celebrating this day is to discuss the serious nature of social problems as striking as extreme poverty, which affects more than one billion people across the world, who are forced to live on less than one dollar per day. We do so in the footsteps of the person who proclaimed this day in 1987 and following the decision of the United Nations in 1992, which enshrined it throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, look at the programmes that we ourselves have put together to attack poverty and social exclusion. Here I would draw your attention to the resolutions of the Lisbon, Nice and Göteborg European Councils and to the work, on which consensus has already been obtained between Council and Parliament, on the programme of cooperation in the fight against social exclusion. I wish, once again, to pay tribute to the work of our fellow Member, Ilda de Figueiredo.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, however, we must have an idea of the problems and of our strategy. We are facing very old problems that concern world development and we must think about the scandal that is war and corruption in so many countries that subject their citizens to the most abject poverty. Some things have been done in our countries to combat disease, need and profound social inequalities; there are new challenges that we are aware of, specifically in the context of the information society, but there are also new problems, affecting what we in Portugal call the ‘new poor’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a problem that greatly affects pensioners and the elderly and I am sorry that the compromise motion did not go further than it did. I think that there is a certain prejudice here against talking about the word ‘family’, but we must be aware that the weakening of the family unit makes us all more vulnerable. It makes individuals lonelier, which is largely responsible for the contradiction we see today, which is that our societies are richer and, yet, we feel increasingly insecure. This is highly relevant to this problem, which we must look at seriously and with our eyes wide open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It affects hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. This poverty has increased in the last six years. In the European Union there are 65 million people living on less than 60% of the national average income, to say nothing of the differences within the Member States. It is thanks to social transfers and social assistance systems that the poverty level has remained at 18% in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But with the slowdown in economic growth, we are in danger of exclusion and poverty being aggravated again. An analysis of the proposals from the associations and the work of the Intergroup on the European fourth world clearly indicate that the fight against poverty and exclusion should become a vital element of sustainable development. The objectives set should be pursued and integrated into all policies, with more resources. I regret that the financial provision for anti-poverty programmes is still inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken European Council should adopt political measures on income, employment, housing, health, education, training and culture. Parliament should also have objectives guaranteeing the right to quality housing for all, against the constant withdrawal of employment and services and re-establishing citizenship and equal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why, on the occasion of the World Day against poverty, which will take place on 17 October, the European Parliament, in cooperation with the associations concerned, should also promote initiatives to raise awareness and to mobilise people to eliminate poverty and destitution. I hope that this day will enable us to make a further commitment to implementing programmes against poverty, by developing economic and social policies that really deal with the underlying causes of that poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is still no progress as far as political reform is concerned. There is a constant flow of reports about the arrest, detention and ill-treatment of dissidents in Vietnam. Defenders of democracy, critics of the communist regime, religious communities and former refugees who want to invest in Vietnam are still at great risk.</p>
<p class="contents">International human rights organisations are still not getting a hearing from the Vietnamese government. They are also banned from monitoring developments and carrying out inspections in the country. The central government is doing its level best to block any form of communication between the dissidents and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">International donors must challenge human rights violations and must call for political reform in Vietnam in addition to economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much in favour of strengthening the economic ties between the European Union and Vietnam. However, as one of the country's biggest donors, the European Union must take a firmer stance and do more to ensure that human rights are respected there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also strongly advocate an independent investigation into the well-being of Mr Binh Vinh Trinh and other investors in Vietnam. Having made a fortune abroad by working extremely hard after fleeing from Vietnam, as many people did a few decades ago, Mr Trinh started investing in his native country again. However, he was arrested under the pretext of illegal investment, and brainwashed in solitary confinement, all of his possessions were seized and his investments were confiscated. This acts as a deterrent and naturally has an extremely negative impact on the decisions of other investors. There must be proper legal protection of foreign investments and investors in Vietnam and the corruption there must be brought to an end. This is an essential precondition for future economic and political development in Vietnam and her links to the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Vietnam must protect, safeguard and guarantee human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been absolutely no progress in Mr Trinh's case over the past few months. He is still on the run and none of his or his family's unlawfully seized possessions have ever been returned to him. As soon as he sets foot in Vietnam, he will be put straight back into prison. I call on the government of Vietnam to make a gesture by respecting the rights of Mr Trinh and other investors and those of other political dissidents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Western head of government did not receive him. A few months later, the human rights activist became President of Czechoslovakia. His name was Václav Havel. From then on, the Western head of government had a great deal of difficulty in getting an audience with the Czech President, who refused to receive him because he wanted to make it clear that this failure to respond to human rights violations and the flouting of human dignity was unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union states are pursuing a similar policy today with regard to Vietnam. It is a policy of autosuggestion. It is claimed that Vietnam is pursuing a reform course. It is also claimed that Vietnam no longer has such a repressive regime as before. Yet the reality sends out a very different message. Persecution of human rights activists has increased. Injustice and the suppression of press freedom have increased, as has the suppression of religious freedom. If we look at the reality of the situation, we must recognise that this regime cannot be set on a reform course without massive external pressure. Economic and geostrategic interests, too, cannot be sustained in the long term unless there is a stronger emphasis on the rule of law throughout South-East Asia, but especially in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is in the European Union's interests to abandon its policies of autosuggestion at last and speak out about human rights violations in Vietnam. The European Parliament adopted this approach with regard to Central and Eastern Europe before 1989. It was fairly isolated at the time, but events proved that it was right. The European Parliament is pursuing the same course today on Vietnam, and I appeal to the Commission, and especially, of course, to the Council and Member States to adopt a more pro-active human rights policy with regard to Vietnam and genuinely send out a clear signal, for in this region of the world, we are dependent on this important country, with its great culture, returning to a more democratic course based on the rule of law. Only then can it be a real partner – also in the economic field – in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conviction, following a botched trial, on 26 September, of 14 members of the mountain ethnic groups for having peacefully demonstrated in favour of freedom of religion and the establishment of an autonomous area in their province is a fresh illustration of this acknowledged contempt for human rights.

The European Parliament has spoken out many times on this matter, the last time only three months ago, to condemn the violation of the freedom to practice religion.</p>
<p class="contents">The country, which is still run by a Communist party, still represses, on a daily basis, any group or individual considered to be a threat by those in power. My fellow Members have already said that the freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, religion and association, rights of ownership and the right to vote are flouted. What is also serious is that no international organisation or independent observer is authorised to come and monitor the human rights situation in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recall that in April, Vietnam celebrated the 25th anniversary of its reunification. The Vietnamese government, which has signed many international conventions on human rights, had an excellent opportunity on that occasion to reaffirm the commitments it had given in that respect. Vietnam is demanding a place on the international stage and has potentially everything in its favour to become a prosperous country. Reality, unfortunately, shows the situation to be quite different. The Vietnamese people live in poverty, their society is in decline and the country is still under-developed.</p>
<p class="contents">By signing a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union in 1995, Vietnam gave a formal commitment to respect human rights and promote democracy. The joint EC/Vietnam Committee that met in September in Hanoi reconsidered all the aspects of relations with the European Union, including the joint agreement on democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on Parliament today to give its full support to the European Commission in implementing its partnership strategy in the region. We must all encourage the process of reform in Vietnam. Respect for fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience should constitute the basis of sound and constructive cooperation with that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We acknowledge that there are human rights problems in that country to be tackled, but we welcome its partnership in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet not many of us are aware of the other crisis in Uzbekistan. Reporters report on the problem and potential problem of refugees in the area. They do not report on the 13 million people affected by one of the worst droughts in history in the area, that started in the spring of last year. They do not report that six million children under 14 are affected. They do not report that drinking water and irrigation water is in desperately short supply, that most of the crops in the affected areas have failed, that poor-quality drinking water and sanitation problems have resulted in one of the highest levels of ill health in the region. They do not report that only 54% of the people in urban areas in Uzbekistan have access to sewage networks, or that only 3% in rural areas have such access. As a result, parasitic infection is rife and the third cause of infant deaths is diarrhoeal disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Malnutrition and poverty have reached crisis point. We need urgent action to supply essential drugs and equipment, to strengthen water-quality control, to support and monitor nutrition programmes, to train health workers and conduct health education programmes. We also need to help the country change from its heavy use of agrochemicals, its diversion of rivers and its poor drainage system.

<p class="contents">We are therefore especially concerned about the situation in Uzbekistan today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is no longer a booming country; it is a country in a difficult political situation, scarred by hunger and environmental devastation. Intensive cotton farming with excessive use of fertilisers has undoubtedly contributed to this environmental disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as the previous speaker has just pointed out, Uzbekistan is now in a situation in which we must fear the worst over the coming weeks and months, especially in light of developments in Afghanistan. The European Union is called upon to help the region as a whole – for in a situation of economic privation, environmental devastation, and a permanent threat from Islamic fundamentalist or terrorist groups, it would be an even greater disaster if the European Union failed to help the people in this region by supporting them in their efforts to overcome the catastrophic environmental and health situation and assisting them to achieve a modicum of economic prosperity, and above all by providing basic foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that Commissioner Nielson, who is the appropriate person to participate in this debate today, is already giving thought to these issues and making preparations with his staff for what has to be done today, but above all, what must be done in the event of further disasters, e.g. in response to refugee flows from Afghanistan. Our task is not simply to deliver great sermons. This is not a clash of civilisations; it is not a campaign against Islam. What we must do is to take practical action during the coming weeks and months and show the people that we genuinely wish to express our solidarity and support with more than just words.</p>

<p class="contents">Last June I spent an entire week travelling around Uzbekistan with a European Parliament delegation. We visited the Karakalpakstan region, the region where they are struggling with the serious problems of the Aral Sea. The situation there is disastrous.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, could I have your attention for a moment? We met the people there. We met the relief workers. They expressed their thanks to our delegation, they spoke to us and they gave us messages, but they also told us: We have seen so very many delegations come and go. When will something finally be done about the water problem in our region? When will the European Community, when will the whole international community help us to actually do something together with the other countries in this region?</p>
<p class="contents">The situation there is disastrous, including in the area of public health. Mr Wiebenga and I visited the local hospital in Nukus where patients with TB are treated. The situation there is degrading. The sewers in the basement are broken. They are absolutely overflowing with human excrement. There are mosquitoes flying around. The stench there is unbearable. Patients have to keep the flies and mosquitoes off their bodies, with the result that patients who should really be staying for three months leave. They go home. They infect members of their families. They infect other people around them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that as an international community we must take our responsibility seriously.

The European Parliament must take pleasure in this result. The issue of East Timor has been on our international agenda for a number of years. We have given voice to those who have fought to return dignity to the Timorese people and to have their right to decide on their own destiny recognised and we have condemned the violation of human rights by Indonesian troops and by militias sponsored by them. I must emphasise the work undertaken by so many Members of this House. In particular, I wish to refer to Carlos Costa Neves, who has chaired the inter-group ‘For East Timor’ and who has taken part in each of the European Parliament’s missions to that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We may have helped the people of East Timor to regain freedom and democracy, but we also have a responsibility for helping them to consolidate their gains. East Timor needs help from the international community: political, technical and financial help. Without this assistance, it will not be possible to rebuild what was destroyed, assemble a new administration and ensure the necessary development. This is why we call on the international community: to provide more support and assistance. Our compromise resolution, therefore, calls for an extension of the United Nations mandate, for the return of the refugees who wish to return to their countries and for the fight against the impunity of those who have committed crimes and who have violated fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must say that I am glad to see a considerable degree of consensus and multiparty support for the candidature of Xanana Gusmão for the Presidency of East Timor. This Sakharov prize-winner could be a reference point for unity and could make a fundamental contribution to consolidating the new democratic institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Coelho has already said, East Timor used to be one such case. Today, however, is a joyous occasion. What we have seen and heard today is the success of the process in Timor. At this moment, I should also like to tell this House of the gratitude of the Portuguese and, of course, of the Timorese people, for the increasing solidarity that their cause has enjoyed in the European Parliament and which has spread throughout the world. Mr Coelho has already mentioned the various resolutions and the high point, which was the award of the Sakharov prize to Xanana Gusmão, the distinguished leader of the Timorese resistance, who will be, by broad national consensus, the next President of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This should serve as an example to us of how, with tenacity and patience, we can achieve positive results and help good causes. Three years ago, anyone in this House who said that this would really be happening today would definitely have been called crazy. Three years ago, we could not have imagined the referendum of August 1999 and the overwhelming consensus of the Timorese people. It would have been impossible to imagine that the tragic crisis following the referendum would be overcome and that, on 30 August this year, we would have the first elections of a new, free and independent State. We must continue to help East Timor. We made a major contribution to winning the independence for which they were fighting, in defence of their identity. We must keep this sense of responsibility alive and remain vigilant to the potential dangers in a geo-political context that remains highly uncertain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly honoured to be able to speak about East Timor today as I was the Chief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission in the country between 23 August and 11 September, and was able to see for myself just how important these elections were for the people of East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I turn to substantive issues, however, I would first like to congratulate UNTAET and especially Sergio Vieira de Mello on their work, which was often carried out under very difficult conditions. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Independent Electoral Commission, the European Commission both here and in East Timor, and the smooth cooperation with UNDP, the Embassy of Portugal, and the Belgian EU Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">East Timor has taken the first step towards independence and the founding of a separate state. What is especially important now is the continued support of the international community and the European Union, for the country faces enormous challenges. It is therefore essential that the UN peacekeeping units and civilian police remain in the country until East Timor is able to take over these security tasks itself. The EU Member States must lobby hard for this with the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the European Union and the United Nations, as well as other donor countries such as Portugal and Germany, to continue their technical and financial assistance, for the Commission and the Council to take a positive stance on East Timor's application for accession to the ACP – the "Everything But Arms" Initiative, for example, could take effect immediately – and for the EU to support the East Timorese government in developing a master plan for the country's development. In this context, the EU should focus particularly on rural development and health. The entire administrative sector must also be strengthened and, in some areas, built up from scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is education, above all, which will be the basis for and a key element of all the development projects – for one thing is clear: these democratic elections are an extremely important step for the country's future. However, we must not forget that this is just the first step out of many which must be taken towards a functioning democracy and civil society. For East Timor's further institutional development, it is also important for the EU to participate in the arrangements for the presidential elections and the necessary voter education. There are many other examples, but one thing, above all, must not be allowed to happen: we must not withdraw from responsibility now that the foundation stone for an independent state has been laid and abandon the people who are only gradually beginning to recover from the trauma of the dreadful events of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, let us be prepared for the fact that our support will continue to be needed for many more years. As a key factor in this context, the assistance must be coordinated efficiently if it is to achieve its objective. After my many discussions in the country itself, I am certain that the East Timorese people are aware of the problems facing their country and understand only too well how difficult the way ahead will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us work together with the East Timorese people as equal partners. We will also be sending out a positive signal to the international community – that it is possible to resolve problems peacefully and initiate development, especially at the present time.</p>

The principles of an ethical international policy have triumphed in East Timor. The example of this country gives us further hope that world history is not merely a succession of barbaric acts and cruelty. At a terrible time, in which fear and apocalyptic concerns prevail, East Timor represents a ray of light and hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections to the constituent Assembly in East Timor have been the crowning glory of an impeccable democratic process that does honour to the United Nations and, above all, to the people of Timor. Not all is rosy, however, in Timor as you all know. It is a very poor country, has an economy to rebuild, a State to organise and health, education and social protection systems to create. Only with the help of the international community, specifically the European Union, will Timor be able to turn its independence into something marvellous and a fine example for the rest of the world. My own country, Portugal, will certainly devote a great deal of affection and support to Timor, since it has become both a Portuguese and a universal cause.</p>

It seems from the events of 11 September in New York that democracies are particularly vulnerable to terrorism, which has no respect for the ballot box as a way to achieve change in societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Now – and in spite of Colombian President Pastrana's concession three years ago of a large demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland, where 17 000 of its guerrillas roam at will – the FARC, instead of pursuing a legitimate, peacefully negotiated settlement, continues its policy of kidnapping and murdering civilians. Last Sunday it killed the much-loved former culture minister, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, and on Tuesday Congressman Octavio Sarmiento. I am sure that this House will join me in sending a message of condolence to their grieving families.</p>
<p class="contents">Pastrana's policy of granting concessions to the FARC, labelled a terrorist organisation by the USA, has remarkable parallels with the policy of Britain's Tony Blair of granting early release to IRA killers without a prior insistence on the arms decommissioning to which they had already agreed. Curiously, three IRA suspects are currently under arrest in Colombia for advising the FARC on how to conduct murderous campaigns, on which, as we know, the IRA is an expert.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have a clear answer to President Pastrana's dilemma, as only 18% of Colombians in a recent poll supported suspending peace talks, scrapping the demilitarised zone and resuming full-blown civil war. Only the Colombian Government can decide what is best for the future of its country and what price it is prepared to pay to achieve peace. Nevertheless, I am sure that, as well as supporting this resolution, this House will join me in praying for the long-suffering people of Colombia and in hoping sincerely that the FARC and the guerrillas will see the folly of their evil ways and that the Colombian Government will achieve a policy of reconciliation without compromising justice or freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to state that up to now, in the documentation I have seen, I have not found any involvement by the Government of the United Kingdom in the violence in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that in Colombia people are being killed – the revolutionaries (the FARC) kill them, the paramilitary organisations linked to the Government kill them – and to make any kind of pronouncement right now as to the guilty parties in Colombia seems premature to me. At present there is a situation of violence and those responsible for that violence are in fact the Europeans, because we Europeans left in Colombia, as in many other countries, a trail of injustice, of social differences, which persist to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been concerned with Colombia for a long time. Unfortunately, we have not been able to influence events in a very positive way. But we have at least succeeded in increasing the country’s economic activity to the point where, today, 40% of Colombian exports are destined for the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in the European Union we are faced with a somewhat desperate task, because the years are passing and the violence continues. The violence also affects us closely. For example, in Madrid, forty Colombians have been assassinated in the last six months by Colombian drug trafficking organisations, by hired assassins who come specially from Colombia to kill their fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">If the events of 11 September have demonstrated anything it is that violence in the world has no limits, that in a globalised world violence affects us all and that therefore, any action we take in a faraway country such as Colombia ultimately benefits our own citizens as well. We have to protect our citizens and the citizens of the whole world in lands as remote as Colombia. I know that the Commission and the Council are restricted in terms of achieving such results.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Colombian Government, if a large number of people dedicated to achieving the pacification of the country in the country itself (writers, intellectuals, etc.) have failed to achieve those results, it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve them, but I believe – I am availing myself of the presence of the Commissioner, who deals with a very sensitive area concerning this issue, to say this – that we should continue our efforts. Rather as in the myth of Sisyphus, we should continue rolling the stone from the bottom of the mountain to the top, despite all events to the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that both the Commission and the Council will agree with Parliament on continuing to help the Colombian Government and the political leaders of good faith of that country to find a solution to put an end to the escalation of violence, which seems to be plunging Colombia, that magnificent and stupendous Latin American country, ever more into the abyss. I therefore hope that, between the three institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we may help in some measure in the pacification of Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No other country in the world has as many murders of active trade unionists as Colombia. The Colombian Left has been, and continues to be, subject to a terror campaign without parallel. Unfortunately, there is a clear risk that the violence will be further stepped up ahead of the presidential election.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution criticises both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries for the violence. Criticism can fairly be levelled at the guerrillas for kidnappings and violence against the native population. However, it is quite clear that the paramilitaries are responsible for the majority of the political violence. At least 90 percent of the political murders are carried out by the paramilitaries or the military. The paramilitaries would not be able to conduct their campaign of terror without indirect support from, and acceptance by, the regular police and military. Therefore, Colombia’s government also has direct responsibility for stopping the paramilitaries’ campaign of terror in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s role must be to uphold human rights, support the peace process and oppose the military escalation of the conflict inherent in Plan Colombia. The demilitarised zone must therefore, also continue as an important precondition for dialogue between the government and the FARC guerrillas.</p>
<p class="contents">Colombia can only achieve peace and real democracy if human rights are respected. If it is not possible for Colombia’s Left to operate openly and legally, without having its representatives murdered, the guerrillas will not lay down their weapons. It is therefore crucial that the terror campaign against the Colombian left is recognised and combated. This applies especially to the Unión Patriótica, to which the murdered Member of Parliament Octavio Sarmiento belonged. The Unión Patriótica has had at least 4 000 of its members shot by the paramilitaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism of this could have been expressed even more clearly in this resolution which we are about to adopt. Despite this, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that the text of this resolution is sound, and it is vital that, in the future, we carefully monitor and react to developments in Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The eight bullets that assassinated Yolanda Cerón, head of social care in Tumaco, were also foretold and once and for all destroyed the already precarious working conditions of human rights activists on the ground. For a year the paramilitaries have reigned in the town of Nariño. The government lets them do as they will and the list of the dead gets longer. Just before killing Yolanda, the paramilitaries publicly executed thirteen peasants in Teima. On Sunday morning, the former Culture Minister, who had previously been kidnapped, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, was murdered during a chase between the army and the guerrillas. Then, the day before yesterday, the paramilitaries assassinated Octavio Sarmiento, a Member of the National Congress. We know that anyone who defends human rights in Colombia is a target for the paramilitaries. A clean-up campaign was even announced in August. The government had already withdrawn the legal basis for the existence of the paramilitaries in 1989, but has never done anything to seriously dismantle them. On the contrary, the law on defence and national security, ratified by President Pastrana in August, made the situation even worse. The law, which is a real blank cheque for all sorts of violations of human rights, extends the army’s powers and freedom to act in a frightening way and reduces the power of the public prosecutor. The close links between the army and its illegal right arm, the paramilitaries, is well known and the "Human Rights Watch" report, published today, only serves to underline this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to question the bases of its cooperation with Colombia. We are still waiting for the first six-monthly report on the progress of human rights in Colombia promised one year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union takes defending human rights seriously, it should explain its criteria and mechanisms for evaluation and effective protection to us. If it takes the peace process seriously, it should encourage the pursuit of dialogue between the government and the guerrillas, categorically exclude the paramilitaries from the negotiations and support the report from the committee of experts, published on 28 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if it takes its own commitment to legal reform seriously, the first thing the European Union must do is to support the widespread calls for the law on defence and national security to be repealed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN World Day to overcome extreme poverty is a welcome opportunity to highlight the continuing unacceptable levels of poverty and social exclusion across the world and to stress the need to intensify efforts for their eradication. Being able to lead a life free from poverty and social exclusion is a fundamental human right.</p>
<p class="contents">While the challenge of combating poverty and social exclusion is particularly acute in developing countries, it also remains an issue of major concern within the European Union. The most recent available evidence shows that 18%, or over 60 million of our population in the EU, are at risk of falling into the category of being among the relative poor. This is a very high figure.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Councils of Lisbon, Nice and Stockholm, Member States made a commitment to promote sustainable economic growth and quality employment which will reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion as well as strengthening social cohesion in the Union between 2001 and 2010. The intention is to reaffirm and further enhance the importance of the European social model and to ensure that social policy has an equal status alongside economic and employment policies and that all three reinforce each other.</p>
<p class="contents">To underpin their commitment, the Council developed common objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. It also agreed that these objectives be taken forward by Member States from 2001 onwards in the context of two-year national action plans against poverty and social exclusion. Furthermore, the Council established a new open method of coordination which encourages Member States to work together to improve the impact on social inclusion of policies in fields such as social protection, employment, health, housing and education.</p>
<p class="contents">The national action plans and the development of comparable indicators provide the framework for promoting exchange of good practice and mutual learning at Community level. This will be supported from 2002 by a five-year Community action programme on social inclusion which was finalised following a successful conciliation session involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 18 September.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States submitted their national action plans against poverty and social exclusion during June this year. The Commission has been analysing these reports and expects to adopt a draft joint inclusion report on 10 October. This will be the first time that there has been such an EU-level analysis documenting and comparing the situation on poverty and social exclusion across all Member States. It is intended that the joint report will be adopted at the Employment and Social Policy Council at the beginning of December so that it can be tabled and reviewed at the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to the work on the national action plans against poverty and social exclusion, work has been going on to develop a list of common indicators in the field of social inclusion. This will also be presented to and adopted at the Laeken European Council. On the basis of these developments, the Laeken European Council is expected to define the priorities and approaches that will guide efforts and cooperation at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues and concerns raised in the debate on these resolutions are thus well reflected in the initiatives that are being taken. However, a key challenge for the future will be to ensure that all Community decisions, in economic and employment as well as social, policies, are assessed for their impact on social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">While a lot is now happening, there is no room for complacency. Days like the United Nations World Day for the eradication of poverty provide an important opportunity to remind us of the urgency of the challenge we face if we are to build a more inclusive and peaceful world free from the scandal of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the global aspect of this challenge, the first and most important point of criticism is the pathetic level of official development assistance, which is now 0.24%, far from the 0.7% that was promised. This is where everyone will be looking on that World Day and we must come up with a European answer to that problem. Another issue we will be facing is financing for development in March next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Τhe policy of the European Union towards Vietnam, as to all other countries, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns both publicly and in private where abuses or any deterioration in the situation are observed. We have to draw attention, however, to the tendency of the Vietnamese administration to want to control the pace of change and to maintain “social cohesion” during transition to a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I do not need to remind you that the European Union is opposed to capital punishment. In the case of Vietnam, the number of offences where the death penalty can be applied was reduced last year. Juvenile offenders, pregnant women and nursing mothers were also excluded. We welcome this progress, but we want to see the abolition of the death penalty altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">Our principal concern remains that of freedom of opinion. The original “offence” of Professor Nguyen Dinh Huy in 1992 was to be a co-founder of the “Movement to Unite the People and Build Democracy” a movement supported by Vietnamese exiles in North America. Before that, he had been an active anti-Communist. The detention and interrogation of 15 people last month reported by Human Rights Watch was apparently linked to a request to the government to set up an independent “National Association to Fight Corruption”.</p>
<p class="contents">The common thread in all these cases is that, despite some real progress, Vietnam remains a country little accustomed to public dissent. The situation of the Montagnards in the central provinces arose from a complex set of unresolved old problems, but was certainly exacerbated by the lack of effective channels of communication between the local people and the central government. What is needed in Vietnam is continued progress in the country’s reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and to appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Patten was in Hanoi last July he took the opportunity to raise some of these concerns with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister. Next month, we will be holding in Hanoi a meeting of the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, at which all aspects of our relations will be reviewed, including our shared commitment to respect for human rights. We shall continue to raise particular issues of concern and individual cases and to encourage continued progress on human rights in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">On the situation in Uzbekistan, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concern about the present situation in Central Asia. It is clear that the drought is causing damage in the Aral Sea area and particularly in Western Uzbekistan. For example the Amu Darya, where the major problems lie, is reported to have 70% of the normal water level in its upper reaches and just 40-45% in the lower stretches.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to natural causes, some structural reasons can explain the present situation such as poor maintenance of water-irrigation systems, inadequate water management at regional level between the newly independent states, and agricultural practices which are water demanding such as rice and cotton. Lack of sustainability would be the short version of what this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">The July 2001 UN assessment mission to Western Uzbekistan has attributed the absence of water to fundamental structural problems (such as irrigation and crop policies). So what is needed are ways to improve water management and agricultural practice.</p>
<p class="contents">These activities are of a developmental nature. The response so far here is not falling within ECHO's mandate as such. We are, however, looking at this region from a humanitarian aid point of view, where we see a real risk of a negative fall-out from the situation in Afghanistan. In fact, ECHO will include a strengthening of the ability to do something relating to this part of the world in a package soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The absence of democracy, transparency and accountability, corruption at all levels and misuse of the flow of assistance provided by the international community are all part of the problem. Since the independence of these countries, no real effort for maintaining the water system has been made. In addition, national rivalries between the countries in the region have blocked cooperation and also international efforts have been made more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been active in Central Asia in trying to develop long-term projects linked with the structural causes of the drought. A Tacis programme has been developed to fight against the consequences of the drying of the Aral Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thinks that only long-term reform by the Uzbekistan Government itself can solve the current problem. Emphasis should be put on: the creation of alternative forms of employment in the drought-affected areas to improve the irrigation systems in use in these affected areas and, in general, improve water conservation; the introduction of more drought-resistant and less water-hungry crops through further research into new crops, pilot schemes, model farms and whatever is necessary to farm in a sustainable manner in this environment. Definitely a more effective allocation of water throughout the region is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Tacis can develop activities to address these issues, in particular at regional level, but the challenge is huge relating to our actual means.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to East Timor. The democratic elections on 30 August were a cornerstone in the transition towards independence. The Commission was pleased to see how peacefully the electoral process took place. The outcome – with no two-thirds majority for a single party – will require the Constitutional Assembly to work together and to seek a consensus. This will hopefully stabilise the political landscape even further.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can be justly proud of the contribution made by the European Union election observer team, and I am happy to congratulate Mr Kreissl-Dörfler on his leadership of the team of 24 Observers. We will certainly look into the possibility of sending another observer team to the presidential elections in 2002. In general, I am very pleased with the cooperation with the Parliament and Parliament can be pleased with itself because of its ability to deliver high-quality electoral observation.</p>
<p class="contents">The next steps in the formal process will be the adoption of a constitution, hopefully before Christmas this year, followed by the election of a head of state by popular vote, probably around May 2002. Then will come the withdrawal of UNTAET and the declaration of independence. This process seems to be well on track.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the evolution of the political process appears to be equally well under way. The highly commendable performance of UNTAET, the recent nomination of an interim cabinet and the further “timorisation” of management functions in the administration have all contributed to this process. East Timor’s regional anchorage will add an additional foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">East Timor is at an historical juncture. The emergency phase is over. We now have the chance to get the ambitious independence process right. The international community has to consider now the long-term development issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Canberra Donors’ Meeting last June outlined the current, clearly unsustainable, economic situation and signalled the need for further international assistance. There is a narrow tax base, a lack of skilled entrepreneurs, and rural poverty leading to demographic pressure on the urban areas. But there is a realistic perspective for substantial oil revenues coming on stream around 2005-2006. This could change the picture dramatically. The national budget could double and could hopefully ensure financial cover for basic state functions, as well as some stimulus for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to support the effort of the East Timorese to manage these oil activities better than what we have seen in many other developing countries. Statistics will tell us that it should not be very difficult to do it much better, which may not even be good enough, but definitely it is an opportunity. I would say that so far, so good. It would be wonderful to have best practice demonstrated in this field. Lack of transparency in this area is case-by-case across the world the real reason for a lot of trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this politico-economic background, and as one of the major donors for East Timor, the Commission has identified its future role accordingly. We anticipate the need to support one of the poorest countries on Earth until oil revenues provide a more stable economic basis. We will seek to create a development relationship based on a partnership philosophy. This means taking a realistic view of all the requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently drafting a Country Strategy Paper, outlining the sectors. Most likely rural development and public administration will be where we concentrate our activities, suggesting appropriate financial targets for 2002-2006 within these sectors. This is how we will try to do it: focussing both on poverty alleviation and capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">As was said in the debate, East Timor will also be able to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms'Initiative, helping it to develop its foreign trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to Colombia. The Commission shares the deep concern expressed by Parliament concerning the deterioration of the situation in Colombia, in particular, the continuation of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is seriously concerned with the situation of the Peace Process in Colombia after the recent events that have taken place and it is waiting for the evaluation of this process announced by President Pastrana.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to maintain its support to the Colombian people through ECHO. EUR 10 m are being spent this year. In addition, the Commission has approved under its human rights budget, four new NGO projects worth over EUR 3 m.</p>
<p class="contents">As announced by myself in Brussels on 30 April at the third meeting of the Support Group for the Colombian Peace Process, the Commission is currently finalising its proposal for a programme of a “Peace Laboratory” in the Magdalena Medio region in Colombia. This programme envisages the support of actions and movements already being implemented by civil society at local and regional level. The Commission sincerely hopes that conditions on the ground will allow an early implementation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue encouraging the Colombian Government and all other relevant political forces to remain strongly committed to the peace process in Colombia, especially during this time of unrest.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Medina Ortega said, this reminds us very much of the labours of Sisyphus. It is true that it is hard to see progress, but there is no doubt that any relaxation or any type of giving up would definitely make things worse. This is our simple analysis and this is why we continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
