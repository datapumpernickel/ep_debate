Democracy and human rights are now a fundamental element of these agreements, but the conditions under which the elections were held did not correspond to the promises which the Kazakh Government made. The OSCE rightly refused to give the elections a seal of legitimacy, and the Union too must also – and not for the first time – clearly link the continuation of cooperation with progress in democratisation. President Nazarbayev must move quickly to take corrective measures, and we must hope that he has the means to do so. The suspension of cooperation must be a real option if he cannot guarantee that the forthcoming elections will be truly democratic. I know that this is easy to say here in the House, but if we do not take this approach with a country like this, with which we have signed agreements, then we are in nowhere country.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we must step up cooperation with social organisations and the free press to promote democracy in Kazakhstan. As I have said, this is not a task we are setting ourselves, it is a request we are making to the Kazakh Government.</p>

The partnership agreement signed with the EU stipulates that Kazakhstan must comply with OSCE rules for free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The serious crimes committed in connection with the presidential elections in January deserve firm condemnation. We do not wish to see a repeat performance, with infringements of civil liberties, when elections are held later this year. Freedom of the press and the right of individuals to stand as candidates are fundamental elements of democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this opportunity to ask the Commission what steps it intends to take in order to ensure that the existing partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan is fully implemented. And how does the Commission plan to assist in strengthening the faltering democratisation process there? We must help to ensure that democracy fares better than it did at the ill‐fated presidential elections in January.</p>

It is clear that these elections did not conform to OSCE standards for free and fair elections which are part of the commitments entered into with the signing of the partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan. This House should make it absolutely clear to President Nazarbayev, as both Mr Bertens and Mr Holm have said, that implementation of the PCA will depend on progress with the democratisation process and full respect for human rights, especially in the forthcoming local and parliamentary elections. At the same time the Commission must monitor the human rights situation in Kazakhstan closely and report back to this House on progress, or the lack of it. Kazakhstan is a vast country with great economic and political potential. It should not allow that potential to be stymied by its failure to guarantee civil and human rights.</p>

In so doing, we forget that Kazakhstan has only been a free country for ten years and it has actually done remarkably well to come as far as it has done in that time, not to mention the fact that Kazakhstan is a very important partner for us in that region, a partner which, I am glad to say, has freed itself of at least some of the shackles of Russian rule. We should show a great deal more understanding towards the Kazakhs, as well as remembering that we did not become perfect democracies overnight; we too required a lengthy development process. So we should exercise the same patience with the Kazakhs that we keep demanding for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The only reason why I wanted to say that is that I believe we ought not to forget, in our dialogue with Kazakhstan, how important this country is, not only for our own future but also for that of the entire region. We should therefore take due account of this important role and show patience; of course, we should keep telling them how to improve, but without that unbearably schoolmasterly tone which we are all too often inclined to adopt. After all, we must not forget that the Kazakhs are a people with a great history of which they have reason to be proud; if we act like the world's teacher, they will react in a way that neither benefits us nor promotes the achievement of our objective.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Camisón Asensio </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of Parliament"s delegation for relations with Kazakhstan and other countries in Central Asia, I closely followed the news we received about the progress of the presidential elections held in Kazakhstan on 10 January. Unfortunately, this news was not as encouraging as we had hoped as regards the observance of essential and indispensable democratic standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Kazakhstan is an important country surrounded by other important countries – Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and even Mongolia – all of which are of enormous interest to the European Union. This is due not only to their significant potential in terms of natural resources – natural gas, oil, gold, wool – but because the European Union is the global power that at this moment in time can contribute most to resolving the deficits that oppress these countries most after almost a century of Soviet influence: the democratic deficit, the human rights deficit, and the deficit in terms of learning how to establish themselves in a free market economy. That is why this resolution comes at just the right time. All it does is to draw attention to the democratic safeguard clause in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan. It is also timely in that free elections are going to be held in Kazakhstan this year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr von Habsburg. I would like to end by warning you that this resolution must be seen more as a statement of help and understanding than as a reproach. We cannot expect to see perfect results immediately. What we really want is for the process of democratisation to continue. We want it to progress as quickly as possible, to continue and to be free of obstacles.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the points that have been made about the need to see Kazakhstan in a historical perspective and about the importance of Kazakhstan to us and in the region and also about the fact that we have to encourage Kazakhstan to move further, to say when things have gone wrong but to do it in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolutions are based in part on the statement made on 20 January by the presidency on behalf of the European Union. It was clear ahead of the presidential elections that the way in which they were to be conducted fell short of OSCE standards, and that is why the OSCE did not send a full monitoring mission, nor did the EU participate. I also agree with the preliminary statement issued by the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights that we have a basis for important further cooperation with Kazakhstan in these fields.</p>
<p class="contents">President Nazarbayev announced last October a wide‐ranging programme aimed at the gradual democratisation of Kazakh society. The Kazakh Government has assured us that it intends to cooperate with the OSCE and the EU in implementing this programme, in particular regarding the law on parliamentary elections which will be held in the course of this year. I expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan to enter into force in the coming months. The first cooperation Council has already been scheduled for July, and it is the Council's intention to continue the exchanges of view on the democratisation process and to incorporate these into the political dialogue foreseen in the PCA.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will also open a direct dialogue on these issues with members of the Kazakh parliament through the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which is one of the three institutions which will oversee the PCA. Despite the flaws and irregularities which marred the presidential elections, the atmosphere in Kazakhstan remains relatively liberal. These elections were the first in the history of the country to be contested by a number of candidates. I am firmly of the view that the only way to improve the situation is through constant patient work on the part of the EU and other donors and international organisations. The PCA offers us the basis for this. Moreover, we are about to launch a major TACIS project to support the entry into force of the PCA and you will recall that the PCA incorporates by reference the principles set out in the OSCE documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner van den Broek intends to visit Kazakhstan shortly, and we will reiterate our determination to implement the principles we have jointly subscribed to and our readiness to assist with the further development of democratic institutions and the rule of law. The Commission will keep Parliament informed of developments in Kazakhstan and other countries of the region with regard to the implementation of our agreements.</p>

Both sides claim land on the basis of old colonial maps, and both are too stubborn even to talk to the peace negotiators and listen to what they have to say. There are mutual recriminations, with each accusing the other of having started the trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">All the efforts of the UN, IGAD and the OAU have come to nothing, but I hope that they will not give up. International pressure must be brought to bear on both sides to bring about a new cease‐fire for a start.</p>
<p class="contents">Eritrea and Ethiopia must realise that they have a great deal to lose if Lomé cooperation is suspended. Both sides will eventually come back to the peace proposals put forward by the OAU, or at least I hope they will. I also hope that they will come to their senses quickly. The longer it takes them to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict, the more enormous will be the cost. The disastrous effect that this is having on the people and the economy of both countries is indescribable. I can tell you this from first hand experience, as I spent some time there when both countries were still united. I have to say that the situation in this area of Africa deserves to be given our fullest attention.</p>

At our last part‐session, we said that the presidency of the Council should attend these debates. It would be good if that were the case, but unfortunately I see nobody from the presidency. Perhaps you could arrange that for next time through the Bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">On the border between Ethiopa and Eritrea, serious conflicts occurred between those two countries in May and June of last year. There were battles in which thousands died; in June 1998 a moratorium was signed, but hostilities have broken out again. We have a frontier conflict here which the population certainly does not want. International conciliation efforts appear to have failed. Nevertheless, we should not stop trying to achieve peace in that region, because peace will never be achieved there by military means.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to say that we shall have to exert pressure on both countries. That is why it is also right to threaten them with suspension of support under the Lomé Convention and of development aid from the European Union and its Member States. But this pressure may not be enough. Perhaps it would also be important and appropriate – and we saw this when we met the two ambassadors in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in the Executive of the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly – for us to draw up a development plan, subject to both sides withdrawing their military hardware, to their showing willingness to negotiate, and to their being prepared to develop democracy and the rule of law and to grant reciprocal inspection rights. We would then deliver a development plan and would step up the current level of development aid as an initial measure.</p>

It was widely predicted. Armed conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has broken out again with unprecedented violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the information reaching us is very patchy, it is clear that there have already been thousands of victims, military and civilian, and the conflict, which apparently flared up after a small border problem, is threatening to become one of the bloodiest wars in the history of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament we have always been concerned about relations and tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Parliament"s Committee on Development and Cooperation succeeded in getting the ambassadors from both countries to attend several meetings it organised – something which no‐one else has managed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we call on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease hostilities immediately. We also call for absolute compliance with the moratorium on air raids, which has already been violated, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaders of the two countries of the Horn of Africa now have the historic responsibility of choosing between peace and even worse crimes against their peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The OAU proposal for an agreement between the two countries must be accepted by both parties without further delay, before the situation on the ground renders it obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">All arms supplies and military assistance to the two warring sides must immediately cease, as called for yesterday by the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must join the Organisation for African Unity in applying intense pressure and offering political and diplomatic mediation, which has been totally inadequate in the last few months.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States of America might have been expected to take on the task over the last few months, but it has proved quite incapable of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">So we call on the Council to take a clear and strong political initiative along these lines, and on the Commission to ensure that the thousands of refugees and victims of the conflict receive the maximum humanitarian assistance wherever possible.</p>

One can but continue to deplore the fact that international mediation efforts have failed to secure a peaceful settlement, and the two countries must surely share the blame.</p>
<p class="contents">The double tragedy is that the population of the two countries is poverty‐stricken and suffering in so many ways. This makes it all the more difficult to link development aid and Lomé‐related benefits. But it may be that a hard line will need to be taken by the EU. Clearly, the OAU and the UN have a continuing role to play, but is it out of the question for the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly to play a key role as well in trying to resolve this desperate situation?</p>

I will quote it in English and hope that the interpreters can follow me: ‘1949: Eritrea"s fate. Rome. Foreign Minister Sforza said that the interests of three powers – Great Britain, Italy and Ethiopia – are involved in the problem of Eritrea, former Italian African colony. Count Sforza expressed the hope that Eritrea would not be annexed to Ethiopia. The attempt to reconcile these interests at the expense of Eritrea by territorial partition recalls the old scramble for Africa. Count Sforza said it was repugnant. He said Eritrea could achieve independence after a period of trusteeship administration." End of quotation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty years later, on 11 February 1999, the headline in the International Herald Tribune reads ‘Addis Ababa rules out cease‐fire in border war". So that is that! The article goes on to say that Washington is particularly angry that Antonovs and Migs are being used to bombard Eritrean territory. This is exactly what Ethiopia has been doing for some time, arrogantly disregarding all advice or agreements, simply because it enjoys political support in the world. However, I think that we cannot allow this to continue: we need to adopt a rather more critical approach. Ethiopia"s diplomatic circles may be bombarding us with paper to try to convince us that its cause is just, as it has every right to do, but at the same time various issues relating to the border war and attacks on the Oromos – the largest minority in the area, some of whom have been imprisoned – are being brushed under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">Our urgent resolution today is a desperate attempt by the European Parliament to prevent the war in the Horn of Africa from escalating and further destabilising the region, and it even calls for more humanitarian aid. Quite honestly, I think that we should be talking about stopping financial aid, since it is obviously being used to buy Antonovs and Migs. We all know that Russia will not supply on credit, because it needs cash in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">If it appears that Eritrea too is not prepared to listen to what we say, then it should suffer the same fate. Although the tone of our resolution is very mild and no mention is actually made of stopping financial aid, I would like to ask Commissioner Brittan what he thinks about this, because it is just a waste of money, like in Angola.</p>

Antagonism which could have been resolved through democratic dialogue has instead deteriorated into a tragic situation inflamed by ethnic claims.</p>
<p class="contents">The Africans therefore need to consolidate still delicate regional balances by combining as much of their authority as possible, and in particular by involving civil society so as to put the necessary pressure on the governments involved to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where Europe should intervene, speaking one language: the language of development aid, guided and determined by the drive to achieve political and social stability, which remains the only means of preventing conflicts and reducing the number of zones at risk.</p>

That is where we say precisely what is to be done, namely that the payments made by the European Union to Ethiopia and Eritrea should be linked to both countries' compliance with certain conditions. I believe that this is enormously important if we bear in mind on the one hand that the war which we now experiencing between Ethiopia and Eritrea was entirely foreseeable, and on the other hand that the settlement of this conflict will surely be frustrated by a real lack of democracy in both countries. To my mind, it is a very serious problem when I see, for instance, that newspapers in Ethiopia, which are naturally controlled by the government, are even now reporting continuously on the amounts of money they have already amassed for the next ‘election campaign". I have to say quite honestly that I fear the campaign chest contains some money which our taxpayers might have provided, whereas the opposition has to try desperately to raise funds abroad in order to conduct its election campaign, in order to establish itself as a proper opposition, and the resources for that are non‐existent. This is extremely regrettable, and I very much hope that the appropriate steps will be taken within the European Union to ensure that the funds we provide are used for legitimate purposes. I am sure the Commissioner will agree with that.</p>

The Commission has underlined on several occasions, to both governments, the need to resolve and settle the conflict by peaceful means alone. A military option or so‐called solution will entail – and is already entailing – enormous human suffering and loss. We will continue to support all efforts aimed at peaceful resolution of the conflict, in particular the OAU efforts and proposals. We will continue to put the maximum pressure on both parties, are willing to take any action needed to help find a solution and are currently examining what could be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with interest to Mr Moorhouse's suggestion that the EU/ACP Joint Assembly could play a role, and will draw that to the attention of my colleagues dealing on a more day‐to‐day basis with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the humanitarian situation the Commission is providing humanitarian assistance to both countries and has responded to appeals from both to assist the displaced population in the area of conflict. The Commission has allocated EUR 1 790 000 to two NGOs: Norwegian Church Aid and the Lutheran World Foundation for food and non‐food assistance to persons affected by the conflict in Eritrea. In Ethiopia the Commission has allotted EUR 1 890 000 through CISP, an Italian NGO, also for food and non‐food assistance. Furthermore, EUR 300 000 was approved for ICRC activities in Ethiopia and in Eritrea. The Commission will continue to monitor closely the situation and is ready to mobilise additional resources if needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the wider point that has been raised. The Commission is preparing a communication to the Council on cooperation with ACP countries involved in armed conflicts. In the meantime, in the absence of a European Union position on the matter, the Commission does not think it should take unilateral and isolated measures in the case of this conflict. But the Commission has decided to allocate structural adjustment programme funds in smaller tranches and link further disbursements to a periodic review of the conflict and its possible impact on public spending, particularly in the social sectors. Moreover, when releasing financial assistance to countries in conflict, the Commission will send a letter to the head of state or government requesting assurances that no funds are diverted for belligerent purposes.</p>

I am referring here to the use of capital punishment in the United States of America. Despite the horror that we have expressed in a number of urgent resolutions, a horror that we share with many human rights organisations all over the world, with the churches and with Amnesty International, the number of people being sentenced to death in the United States is increasing, often because their trials are not conducted with due care.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon we are calling for attention to be given to the case of forty‐year‐old Greg Summers who, although innocent, has been sitting for years on death row in the Alace Unit in Texas waiting for the lethal injection that is shortly to end his life. Our resolution calls on the judicial authorities at least to examine the application for a review of his case.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the United States, and in particular the authorities of the State of Texas, to abolish the death penalty immediately and to sign up to a worldwide moratorium on the execution of death sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are a number of amendments calling for attention to be given to other similar cases, and it goes without saying that we will vote for them.</p>

Once again, circumstances compel us to appeal to the government of a civilised nation, the United States of America, not to carry out a death sentence. This time we are appealing on behalf of Greg Summers. He has always protested his innocence. There are doubts as to whether the trial was properly conducted. An appeal was lodged with the competent court in Texas, and there has still been no response to it. For that reason, our first request to the United States and the State of Texas is that this appeal should be considered. Secondly, we call on them to refrain in principle from carrying out death sentences, commuting them instead to life imprisonment or other custodial sentences. Thirdly, we call for them to join in a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, and we call on the institutions of the EU to pass this on to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to our group's amendments on two cases involving Germans – the brothers Karl and Walter LaGrand, who have been sentenced to death in Arizona. This would be the first time since the Second World War that Germans were sentenced to death and executed. We call on the United States not to carry out their death sentences, and we hope that these amendments will be incorporated into today's resolution. In both cases, we propose that the death sentences be commuted to life imprisonment or another appropriate custodial sentence.</p>

It is absolutely incredible, and it is something the House should not just criticise but condemn. I hope that his case will be reviewed very quickly, and it would appear appropriate that a pardon should be granted. Human rights must be defended all over the world, it is as simple as that. Partly as a result of his treatment in prison Mr Peltier"s health has visibly declined, but he is still being denied appropriate medical treatment for reasons which no one will explain. Like anyone else, this man deserves proper medical treatment in hospital, the prison hospital if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, I put a number of questions to the Council here in the House about the Peltier case, but the President‐in‐Office said that he did not think it necessary to take action, and it was not in his power to do so. I would now urge the Commission to take the case up, and I think that the Union as a whole should at least enter into discussions with the United States about its human rights policy.</p>

<p class="contents">I can still remember the alarming remarks made by their spokesperson, Bobby Castillo, who had experienced American prisons. As a leader of the American Indian Movement, Leonard Peltier has played and continues to play a major role in the defence of the rights of indigenous people.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the events of June 1975, in the Pine Ridge reserve, South Dakota, he was given two life sentences, although no proof of his guilt was ever furnished, and despite the fact that he had been illegally extradited from Canada. After 23 years in prison, his health has deteriorated dramatically and, although he permanently suffers as a result of complications from an operation, the prison"s management deny him access to adequate treatment in a specialised hospital. Amnesty International, the IFHR and <span class="italic">France Liberté</span> have launched a new campaign to defend Leonard Peltier and fight the unacceptable number of human rights violations in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mumia Abu‐Jamal, who is still on death row, has sent him a message of support. We should, for our part, once again participate in this action and ensure that public opinion is alerted throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament adopts the resolution cosigned by my group, it will be sending a clear message to the American authorities and prison directors. Leonard Peltier must be given the chance to get better and receive the appropriate medical treatment in the clinic of his choice. He must be released from prison so that he can take up his legitimate struggle for the defense of the rights of the indigenous people that the United States continues to scorn.</p>

The latest report on human rights in the European Union shows that we are far from being beyond reproach in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, if I take the floor today to speak about the case of Leonard Peltier, it is because all other possible avenues have genuinely been exhausted and time is short, given the worrying state of Mr Peltier"s health. There are, in fact, two issues to our message to the United States. The first concerns the procedures used that resulted in Leonard Peltier"s sentence, and the second concerns the prison authorities" refusal to let him receive the appropriate medical treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that Amnesty International expressly admitted that it had reservations about the procedures that lead to Mr Peltier"s sentence and that the government authorities themselves admit to the vagueness that surrounded the sentence. Moreover, the trial revealed the unusual methods used during the case"s preparation, as my colleagues previously mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts should have lead to a retrial, but this case confirms that no court, be it American or European, will easily reopen a trial on which a sentence has already been passed. Herein lies a future struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the previous speaker pointed out, the most incomprehensible and intolerable aspect of this case is the refusal of the American authorities to let Mr Peltier, whose health has considerably deteriorated, receive the medical attention he needs. The fact that prison facilities are unable to treat his condition is completely unacceptable as an argument to deny him the treatment he needs. Solutions do exist and have already been put forward. The refusal of the prison authorities to let him receive such treatment amounts to a blatant violation of human rights and of the commitments made by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group will support the call for appropriate treatment and the request to grant Mr Peltier clemency.</p>

All the countries of the world are given plus and minus points. Words of praise and censure are pronounced. What it boils down to is that the whole world has to submit to American values and ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is very important to do what Parliament is doing today, to hold a mirror in front of the Americans and to tell them that, if they must try to force their values on everyone else, they should also acknowledge that there are sections of the population of their own country – some of them native Americans – who may have other ideals in some respects, a different bond with their own country, with their own native soil, than the Americans who arrived later. In this situation, it is very useful for us to keep returning to the specific case of Leonard Peltier.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a case that has attracted international attention. There is an international Peltier Committee, of which I, for example, am a member and which has been dealing with the case for many years. I consider it particularly important that the European Parliament too has adopted a resolution calling for the case of Leonard Peltier to be placed on the agenda of the next talks between the delegation for relations with the United States and its American counterparts, in order to expose something of the hypocrisy that has so often dominated the US line of argument in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Peltier has now been kept in prison for 23 years under exceedingly dubious circumstances. He is in very poor health. He has frequently been transferred, which has happened whenever public pressure has mounted and has become too great a burden for the prison in which he was accommodated. This just goes to show that not only the US population but also the international community are really unwilling to accept such injustice from a country that is constantly preaching justice.</p>

<p class="contents">Representative, Joe Kennedy, the son of the martyred President, recently said: ‘This government has the moral duty to correct this injustice. Seeing that justice is upheld for Leonard Peltier would amount to a major act of reconciliation for past injustice done to the native American peoples." The anguish of millions of people who follow this case increases by the day with the rapid deterioration of his health. After an egregious case of medical malpractice in prison hospital, Peltier is suffering a fibrosis of the masseter muscles and ankylosis of the mandibular joint. That means that he cannot eat – that his mouth cannot be opened any more.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States Bureau of Prisons still denies his request to be operated on by proper surgeons. Enough is enough. In the name of humanity we urge the United States Administration to take prompt care of its native son. We ask President Clinton to use his powers of pardon to release Leonard from prison immediately.</p>

This time, however, it is quite a different matter, because we are now dealing with those who constantly seek to lecture us, as Mr Habsburg‐Lothringen was saying before. In other words, we do have the right in this instance to say that things simply cannot go on like this. The whole process, which I have studied very closely, raises all sorts of doubts. Not a single piece of conclusive evidence was brought against Peltier. The way in which the American judiciary dispensed so‐called justice in this case is simply indefensible for a highly civilised country. We should therefore point out to our American friends, to whom, of course, we owe a huge debt of gratitude, that something has to be done about Peltier.</p>
<p class="contents">To deprive a person of 23 years of his life, to cast an Indian into prison and give him no opportunities to move about, to give him literally not a single moment of freedom and to leave him languishing in uncertainty is utterly indefensible. Having followed the history of the Peltier case, I would almost make so bold as to say that, even if he had done something, which I do not believe, he would already have paid twice over for everything that happened. If we are convinced that he is innocent into the bargain, that is all the more reason for us to make every effort to ensure that the Americans make justice prevail in their country too – and if not justice, then at least clemency.</p>

<p class="contents">It really is ironic that at a time when the future of the American President himself is being decided by Congress – on an issue which bears very little similarity to the case against Leonard Peltier – neither he nor, in fact, his predecessors, have responded to the pleas of clemency made and awaiting a response for the last 6‐7 years. Therefore we in this Parliament should insist that when Mr Clinton resumes work, presuming he is not impeached, this is an issue which he should address as a matter of urgency. It is an issue which symbolises the treatment of American indigenous peoples, a matter very dear to the heart of this Parliament and I hope that we adopt the resolution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lenz </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span> Madam President, if the European Parliament resolves today to speak out against the increasingly frequent and violent infringements of religious freedom, such a resolution will be a token of our great concern. Freedom of religious observance is a sign of respect, not only for a very profound sense of devotion within many people but also for freedom of expression and association, and hence for a significant part of the corpus of human rights. We are well aware that the violation of religious freedom can have many different causes. We also know that these waves of persecution are not always unleashed by governments. The causes vary from one country to another. There are power struggles for the control of sources of raw materials and water, as in the Sudan, where an armed majority is let loose on a large minority; hatred, envy and social and political tension can focus on ethnic groups, as in India and Pakistan and now in Indonesia too. There are intolerant state religions, as in Iran, Afghanistan and other countries; intolerance can also come from adherents of non‐established religions. It would be impossible to list all the countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The toleration of these persecutions and the forms they take cause us grave concern. They range from horrific murders, as in the case of the Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two children in India, to arrests, torture and the disappearance of individuals; they extend to trials on trumped‐up charges. Extremism, xenophobia and racism often rear their ugly heads, with governments either impotent or unwilling to curb them. And yet there are many constitutions, even in those very countries, which enshrine freedom of religious worship, and states have signed international covenants and UN conventions which are supposed to guarantee religious freedom. But there are also new religious laws with provisions that hover dangerously on the brink of intolerance, and the European Parliament wishes to draw attention to these new risks. Religious groups themselves, however, must also remain tolerant towards those with different beliefs from their own, and must respect freedom of conscience and of the individual as well as obeying the law of the land. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">Abuse of religious freedom is symptomatic of the abuse of human rights. That cannot be said often enough. Respect for the religious beliefs of minorities is also a sign of properly functioning constitutions rooted in natural law and guaranteeing tolerance and peaceful interaction between the various sections of the population. We in Europe have bitter historical experience of the effects of intolerance. We have overcome our intolerance, and we are now trying in this House to help others to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Political and social tensions have been used time and again in the past as an excuse for savage religious persecution. On the threshold of the third millennium, and in view of the increasing degree of global interdependence, I believe we must call on governments and on the representatives of the major religions, who also exercise power in their own name, to observe and to act upon the warning signs. By including democracy and human rights clauses in its treaties with non‐Member States, the European Union tries to ensure observance of human rights in the countries with which it cooperates. The European Parliament will not cease to ask searching questions on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Suppression of religious freedom – let me emphasise again – is a clear symptom of human rights abuses, the causes of which are rooted in national circumstances that need to be improved, circumstances that not only result from religious strife but are also due in particular to social and political factors. The Commission supports interdenominational organisations in many countries; in that way, it reaches the people and gets to the roots of the problems, and we want to ensure that the resources we provide for this purpose are not affected by the developments on which we have been focusing today and that these channels remain open to us.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the background to the resolution which we have tabled today.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, 50 years on from the introduction of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, more and more new rights are being added to it. In fact, people have been saying, quite rightly, that it is all beginning to get out of hand. But this does not mean that the old, established rights are now universally respected. Quite the reverse.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still problems with the rights of religious minorities, which we are discussing today in connection with an urgent resolution on the issue. In many countries, people are still not free to express their religious beliefs in public or to follow their faith as they would wish. They are subject to persecution, repression and discrimination. Recently in Parliament we have talked about Pakistan and Iran, for example, and now unfortunate events in India are giving us cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">For years now, but increasingly so in recent weeks, Christians in India have suffered attacks by Hindu activists. In fact, over the last year there has been an enormous increase in the number of attacks on Christian schools and churches in India. Priests are accused of forcing people to convert to Christianity by bribing them with money and jobs, for which they must be punished. Missionaries in particular are bearing the brunt of the attacks, because they are seen as the legacy of British rule, although strangely enough a lot of the missionaries are actually Christians of Indian origin, a fact that seems to be overlooked here.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, a large group of Christians and Muslims protested against the fact that the authorities are doing nothing to counter these forms of aggression. The attacks have been condemned in the media, and it is certainly not true that the majority of the population approve of them. But this does not make the attacks any less worrying. One possible reason for them is the increase in the number of Christians in India, and strangely enough they are the ones who have been bearing the brunt in recent times, whereas before that it was mainly Muslims who were the target. The reason for this shift is clear: the Muslims in India are concentrated in certain areas, where they are an important factor when it comes to the elections. The Christian minority is smaller in number and is largely scattered all over the country, so it is not important in electoral terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately the Indian Government has now promised to set up a committee to investigate the recent attack on an Australian missionary and his children aged seven and ten. Yet it still appears indifferent to such occurrences. There is clearly a link between the increase in attacks in India and the fact that the BJP, an extremist Hindu nationalist party, has come to power. It believes that too much attention is paid to religious minorities in India, and these attacks help it in its attempts to change this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With this resolution Parliament is making a clear appeal to countries and governments to take a responsible approach in dealing with religious minorities living in their territory. In particular, it calls on the Indian Government to investigate the attacks of recent weeks and to try to prevent them in future. If the situation does not change, the European Parliament and the Member States may wish to consider whether the events in India should affect their dealings with that country. Any respectable government must help to ensure that minorities in its country can live in freedom and can pursue their faith as they see fit. Human rights here involve not just rights for individuals, but also an obligation upon governments to give minorities the freedom that is God"s gift to everyone.</p>

<p class="contents">There have been Christian communities in India since St. Thomas landed in Kerala in AD 52. By and large the Christians have lived alongside their neighbours for many years in peace. But the horrific death of Graham Staines and his two sons, in January, sadly brought to public attention a worsening persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">These murders were the apex of a spiralling campaign of violence against Christians of all denominations. In a courageous address to his people the Prime Minister of India highlighted other incidents which are not acceptable in a modern, tolerant democracy. These killings and other attacks have been unreservedly condemned by the World Hindu Council. The perpetrators of these atrocities do not represent the people of India or mainstream Hinduism. This resolution will be a significant message to those extremists that the people of Europe are in solidarity with all those who value and defend religious and communal tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, not as a spokesman of my group but as an individual who worships Sunday‐by‐Sunday in a British church where we have members of the congregation who see India as their mother country, let me assure the people of India that they are in our prayers and that we pray for both the persecuted and the persecutors.

I know that I am entering dangerous territory here, but from time immemorial, the greatest violations of human rights have been carried out in the name of religion. It has happened regularly throughout history that religious minorities have not been entitled to exercise the same rights as religious majorities, and this is still true today, with religious riots and other problems in India and on Ambon, and structural repression in Iran and Afghanistan. We are not here just to protect Christians, I hope – we must protect and make room for all religions, and this means standing up for Jehovah"s Witnesses in Russia, for example, who are currently facing prosecution in Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group calls on the Commission and the Council to remain vigilant and to take account of religious freedom when assessing the human rights situation in third countries. I hope that there will be an opportunity in the next legislative period to produce a comprehensive report on human rights and the role of religion. Sadly, I will not be here to see it.</p>

Although the Indian Constitution expressly guarantees religious freedom, the violence goes on. Human rights are also constitutionally safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution was tabled following the murder of a Christian missionary, but we must not limit our attention to Christians alone; other religious minorities in India, such as Sikhs and Muslims, are subjected to even greater religious persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no inevitability about these attacks; people are not programmed to use violence. Not at all. The truth is that several extremist groups are fanning the flames, among them the VHP, which patently has links running high up the political ladder.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we forget the origins of the stand‐off in India between different religious groupings: social strife, poverty and illiteracy. Efforts must be made to tackle these problems; then we may well see less religious tension.</p>
<p class="contents">India is not the only country where religious groups are pitted against one another, however. Similar problems exist elsewhere in Asia, for example in Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives. It is incumbent upon all of us to work for human rights. Religious freedom is one important element, together with freedom of speech, freedom of movement and the right to non‐discrimination. We must also counter violent crimes against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation. A great deal remains to be done in defence of these principles.</p>

We will therefore naturally be supporting the joint resolution on freedom of religion in India. We unreservedly condemn the use of violence against Indian Christians, and we demand that the national government and the state authorities responsible for maintaining law and order should take firm measures where necessary not just against the perpetrators of the violence, but also against the police officers who simply stand by and watch.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out here that in Orissa, where a missionary and his two children were brutally murdered, it is not the BJP that is in power, contrary to what some people think, but the Congress Party, to which the likely murderer also belongs. The violence against Christians should also not make us forget that for the last ten years, particularly in India, thousands of Hindus have been systematically murdered by Muslim fanatics in riots and pogroms that have sadly been much worse than the current violence against Christians. For example, in 1990 almost the entire Hindu population of the state of Kashmir, around a quarter of a million people, fled after a series of massacres in which more than a thousand people were killed. The instigator of this ethnic cleansing, Amanula Khan, the leader of the Kashmiri Muslims, is still given a hero"s reception in various European countries, including my own. I think a little consistency is called for here. In this respect the joint resolution, which I think is very general, could also have made reference to the systematic and particularly barbaric persecution of Christians and all non‐Islamic religions in the neighbouring country of Pakistan. That omission has now been put right. For the rest, we shall be happy to support this resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">We also welcome the adoption by the UN Human Rights Commission on 2 April 1998 of a resolution which calls for countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty to apply a moratorium on the execution of death penalties with a view to abolition. EU Member States co‐sponsored the resolution, which had been introduced by Italy, and it is striking to note that the United States voted against it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is greatly concerned about the rising number of executions taking place in the United States. The European Union has raised this question a number of times with the US authorities. As the Commissioner responsible for relations with the United States, I have no embarrassment or hesitation in raising this issue with them: it is appropriate that one should do so with a country with which we have close links and which has expressed on numerous occasions its concern about human rights elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union follows closely individual cases in the United States and has made a number of <span class="italic">démarches</span> in specific instances. In the event that it concerns a person having the nationality of one of our Member States, the Union will pay special attention to compliance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963, which in Article 36 provides arrested foreigners with the right to consular assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the specific case of Mr Peltier, who, of course, is not on death row but is a long‐term prisoner. I can only say that anybody who heard the speeches made from diverse parts of the House, with different political viewpoints, could not but be moved by what was said. The Commission, through its delegation in Washington, is looking into the circumstances of the medical condition of Mr Peltier and will do its utmost to support the actions of the European Parliament in this regard. We will carefully follow up this case, and look forward to the exchanges on this issue at the next meeting between the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the United States and the United States' Congress. Not only is it legitimate that this subject should be discussed but, in the circumstances described, it is inevitable and natural.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of freedom of religion, I am glad that it has been broadened out and has not concentrated entirely on the situation in India, because it is right to say that there are problems, to put it mildly, with regard to freedom of religion in many countries, and it would be misleading to focus only on India. As far as we are concerned, freedom of religion is a fundamental human right and we should defend it wherever it comes under attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there has been a certain topicality with regard to the reports about attacks on Christians in India, which are deeply worrying. The Commission's delegation, which continues to keep us fully informed on the situation as it develops, is fully associated with Member States' missions in monitoring the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, ethnic and religious violence is not a novelty in India, but violence against Christians on the scale reported is new. The issue is now highly politicised in India and it has the potential to affect the political situation there – reference has been made to the statement by the Prime Minister which, of course, we have noted. The issue is dividing not only Opposition and Government but is also controversial within the BJP itself.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the principle of secular government and the protection of minorities is deeply ingrained in Indian democratic tradition. There can also be no doubt that opinion leaders and civil society in India are deeply shocked about the events and the damage done to India's image, and that is amply reflected by the wide press coverage which these events have received since they began.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that responsible Indian politicians, together with a strong consensus in civil society, can succeed in mobilising the necessary political momentum to control violence. We strongly support the continuation of the quiet and persistent work of our representatives on the ground, our ambassadors, NGOs and concerned Indian citizens as the best guarantee to check the current situation, and for that they were recently thanked by the Archbishops of Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully endorses the objectives of racial tolerance, social harmony and full respect for human rights which underpin the European Parliament's motion for a resolution.</p>

After the November 1998 agreement and the new agreement at the start of this year, violence has broken out once again between the troops of President Vieira and General Ansumane Mane. The conflict of June 1998 has returned and people are once again fleeing in large numbers. The civilian population are suffering yet again as a result of the destruction caused by this war.</p>
<p class="contents">The Abuja peace agreement has been suspended and the foreign troops are committing countless human rights violations. It is extremely important that the Abuja agreement should once again be applied in full. All foreign troops – except of course for the ECOMOG forces – must leave the country and the government of national unity must try to organise proper elections, which would be an almost unprecedented event.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must be prepared to do something to help here. Great efforts are needed in West Africa to prevent conflicts from spilling over into other countries. There are far too many transnational conflicts. We must do everything we can to prevent the proliferation of light weapons, and the Union must offer ECOMOG technical and financial support and humanitarian aid for the people.</p>

The European Parliament must show its solidarity with the people of Guinea‐Bissau, who are suffering in this civil war. Hundreds of people have died, thousands of civilian refugees have had to leave their country, hospitals are short of medical supplies and are struggling to cope, and hunger and disease are spreading.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an agreement in Abuja which provided for a cease‐fire and arrangements to contain the conflict. Despite this, military operations have started again, and everything points to this being the responsibility of President Vieira"s troops. We deplore the political irresponsibility and shortsightedness of political and military leaders who put their own interests above the interests of their people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must demand respect for the Abuja agreements which provide for the formation of a government of national unity and the organisation of presidential and legislative elections, respecting the independence and territorial integrity of Guinea‐Bissau.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger that the conflict will become international, given the situation in Casamanca. The presence of foreign troops, notably from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, whom international human rights organisations are accusing of human rights violations against civilians, is aggravating that danger. So the withdrawal of all foreign troops is a fundamental prerequisite for restoring peace. The only troops that should stay to guarantee the cease‐fire and ensure compliance with the agreements are the ECOMOG troops. The people of Guinea‐Bissau desperately need help, and this means strengthening humanitarian aid and ensuring that aid actually reaches the people who need it. Here I would stress the importance of neutral non‐governmental organisations operating on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I call on the European Union to support the efforts of the Prime Minister designate, Francisco Fabu, to establish a government of national unity capable, above all, of serving the interests of the long‐suffering people of Guinea‐Bissau.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Coelho </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Guinea‐Bissau is tragic. There are thousands of displaced persons, and widespread hunger and misery caused by a war which it seems nobody wants and is of no use to anyone. It is vital to restore peace and to silence the guns in Guinea‐Bissau. It is vital to observe the Abuja agreement and rapidly establish ECOMOG, the peace‐keeping force of the Economic Community of West African States. President João Bernardo Vieira and General Mané have to bear the heavy responsibility of enabling and ensuring compliance with the agreement they have signed, by stabilising the situation in Guinea‐Bissau, installing the new government of national unity, organising free elections and allowing the country to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can and must help, and that is what our compromise resolution is about. Humanitarian aid and technical and financial support are needed, but we can also help by firmly condemning the escalation of the war and demanding the immediate withdrawal of the foreign military forces involved in the conflict. Without that withdrawal the human rights abuses will continue and peace will not be possible. In this case, Parliament"s recommendation that the Council should speak with one voice on this matter is very apposite. And given much of the news published in the media, I would like to ask if the Commission can give Parliament any information guaranteeing that there are no military forces from any Member State of the Union involved in this sad conflict, which we hope to see ended as rapidly as possible.</p>

President Jean Bernardo Vieira and General Ansumane Mané concluded a peace agreement in Abuja on 1 November 1998, and it is absolutely essential that they observe the terms of that agreement. The Council and the Commission must insist on that. The agreement requires the withdrawal of foreign troops, especially from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea. Here too, it is up to the Council and Commission to exert pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The deployment of ECOMOG troops was requested, permitted and wanted. The peacekeeping forces of the Economic Community of West African States are essential as guarantors of the peace. Since 3 February another cease‐fire has been in force. We support the territorial integrity of the country, or so I believe. We call on the government to reform itself into a government of national unity. If that is done, the Commission should then provide appropriate aid, since thousands of people have fled their homes. Refugees are being produced here, and famine is being produced here. We should also mention that much of the misery has been caused by weapons from Western Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The politicians and the armed forces must abide by the terms of the peace agreement. If they do not do that, they are irresponsible, uncaring and blind to the lessons of history. They must observe international law and human rights. Their observance of international law and human rights is the basis on which we can provide humanitarian aid and support ECOMOG through the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that would be a strategy for underpinning the peace. It is up to the two sides in Guinea‐Bissau.</p>

<p class="contents">Recent events have frustrated the hopes raised by the Abuja agreement of 1 November, hopes that the conflict might be over and that Guinea‐Bissau, and especially its martyred people, might enjoy the peace needed to recover from a situation of enormous economic backwardness, aggravated by the destruction and chaos provoked by the conflict which broke out last June.</p>
<p class="contents">That hope must be urgently rekindled, above all in the Guineans who have witnessed and been victims of this senseless confrontation, which can only be ended through negotiation, peace and respect for the agreements. We also want to highlight and denounce the destabilising role of foreign troops since the beginning of the conflict. That role is all the more serious because it may be one reason why the Abuja agreement is not being respected. Withdrawal of all foreign military forces not in the territory in strict compliance with that agreement, like the troops from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea, is a prerequisite for implementing the agreement and for the government of national unity to take office in line with that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The West African intervention force has a peace‐keeping mission, and that mission must not be complicated by other foreign forces hindering its action or pursuing other purposes. This conflict must not be turned into some kind of cockfight for the only perch in the chicken coop. A political solution must be found which guarantees peace, respects what has already been agreed, does not undermine the independence and territorial integrity of Guinea‐Bissau and puts an end to a tragic situation which is destroying a country and a people.</p>
<p class="contents">Initiatives to bring humanitarian aid, particularly food and medical aid, to the people are urgently needed and should be welcomed and encouraged.</p>

<p class="contents">Guinea‐Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world. Before the recent conflict that began eight months ago, it had an average per capita income of around USD 220, which is equivalent to less than half an ecu per person per day.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation was beginning to improve. The country was starting to see an increase in reserves, inflation was falling and annual growth stood at 5 %. This has all disappeared over the last eight months. The country will now have negative growth, in other words over the next few months the annual growth rate will be −5 %.</p>
<p class="contents">The war there was undoubtedly the result of the conflicting ambitions of a president who seems to have been in power for ever and an ambitious general. As we know, it has left the country in a situation in which its citizens are fleeing, some are becoming refugees, people are starving and its limited reserves have been squandered. The conflict is even becoming international, with the clear involvement of troops from Senegal – moving from the conflict in the southern region of Casamance – as well as troops from the Republic of Guinea.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the international community must do everything in its power to try to put an end to this situation. We must be able to restart the aid programme that the international bodies had launched and which has once again been paralysed. We must ensure that foreign troops are withdrawn and that only the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces remain. Finally, given that the cease‐fire that was renewed in February – only a few days ago, in fact – has already been broken, we must provide the Prime Minister designate with the power he needs to allow the people of Guinea‐Bissau to resolve their future in peace.</p>

What we are talking about here is the catastrophe that devastated the Canary Islands, and I must point out that this catastrophe adds to the problem of the region"s ultraperipheral location. The storms affected its entire port and coastal infrastructures, as well as its agriculture, in other words the tomato and banana crops which are fundamental for the region"s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need the full minute we have been allocated as we merely want to urge the Commission to make additional efforts in its structural programmes to help this remote region to overcome this catastrophe. It is called a ‘natural" catastrophe, although we may soon have to consider the fact that such catastrophes are not so natural and that they are sometimes the result of the damage we have done to the environment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Posada </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at the beginning of January a violent storm struck the islands of Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Palma and Hierro, doing untold damage to port infrastructure, coastal roads and shore installations. It also affected the tomato and banana crops, and other fruit and horticultural production. As these are islands, there is no alternative infrastructure, so it is vital to the life of the archipelago for it to be in full operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural production in the islands in 1997 amounted to 105 495 million pesetas and the damage to agricultural production represents 14.4 % of the damage to infrastructure and about 16.7 % of 1997 turnover. Furthermore, the largest tomato producers in the Canary Islands have suffered damage amounting to 5 664 million pesetas, equivalent to 19 % of production, and the damage in the banana sector amounts to 7 393 million pesetas, corresponding to 20.5 % of 1997 production, while damage to infrastructure amounts to 2 470 million pesetas.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are asking the Commission to check the extent of the damage quickly, and to include the Canary Islands and specific projects for repairing damage caused to the coastal infrastructure in the Union"s structural programmes. We are also concerned about the effects of the storm on the turnover of agricultural producers for 1999 (and consequently, on the Canary Islands' economy) and we call on the Commission to provide the aid necessary to mitigate the damage suffered in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, while I have the floor I want to take the opportunity to express my deep sadness at the news of the devastation caused by the Colombian earthquake of 25 January 1999, which is said to be the worst earthquake to have struck the country this century, killing over a thousand people and injuring countless others, most of them from the poorest communities in the region. So I want to express the solidarity of the Group of the European Radical Alliance with the victims and the families of the dead, and with the people of Colombia. According to news from the area, the Colombian army apparently faced great difficulty, despite sending thousands of soldiers to the region, in preventing widespread looting in the city of Armenia, where the looters fired on the rescuers and public disorder is hindering rescue operations. There is also the danger of corruption, which may also prevent all the international aid reaching the people it is actually intended for. So I urge President Pastrana and the Colombian Government to take firm measures to restore public order in the disaster areas while respecting human rights, and to take all measures necessary to ensure that emergency aid reaches its proper destination. But most of all I hope this terrible event will not disturb the peace process under way in Colombia, which is already difficult enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I also want to express our satisfaction that the Commission made EUR 1.5 million available immediately, including EUR 0.5 million not spent last year, and to applaud the constructive cooperation of the Red Cross, Oxfam and other NGOs operating in the region. And I call on the Commission and the Governments of the Member States to cooperate with the appropriate NGOs in making every possible effort to resolve this crisis and to implement a special development programme to meet the medium‐ and long‐term needs of the earthquake zone.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, we are fortunate that Commissioner Brittan is present here with us because last night he took the trouble to stay here until midnight to discuss an issue that is very closely related to the ultraperipheral regions and the Canary Islands, that is, the banana industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brittan, I am addressing you directly because if you read our motion for a resolution you will see that it relates to the serious damage that has been caused to agriculture in the Canary Islands. To be specific, and although this is not mentioned in the motion for a resolution, I can tell you that as far as banana production is concerned, there has been so much damage that neither in 1999 nor in 2000 will we come close to the minimum guaranteed production of 420 000 tonnes per year. This is because not only parent banana trees but also young banana trees were destroyed. I am telling you this because when we hold talks in Washington with a government that talks about defending free competition, I think we should let them know that our banana plantations have to contend with adverse climatic conditions and that in some regions of the Community, both in the West Indies and in the Canary Islands and Madeira, such catastrophes often occur. I believe that this is an important argument.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the aim of the resolution we are moving is rather different. I would like to read something unusual to the Commissioner as I think it is very interesting. It comes from the Las Palmas newspaper <span class="italic">La Provincia</span> today, 11 February 1999, which states that the representative of the federation of fruit and vegetable exporters in Las Palmas, Roberto Góiriz, welcomed the agreement that the European Parliament is about to adopt and pointed out that it would be an institution based in Strasbourg that would eventually find the solution to a problem that affects everyone living there. It is unusual that regions as remote as our own now look to the Commission as a source of inspiration and a source of aid. The Commission has always been very receptive to the problems experienced in these regions. We are now asking, among other things, that it should implement as soon as possible the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides for special measures for these regions precisely because of the adverse conditions affecting their economies.</p>

As has already been pointed out, and as you are all aware, at the beginning of January the Canary Islands were hit by a violent storm that has led to significant economic losses in terms of both infrastructure and agricultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that the losses do not just translate to the significant figures contained in the resolution of around EUR 90 million between the banana and tomato crops, which, as you know, form the basis of the region"s economy, a fact that has been highlighted. In addition to these losses, there were also significant losses in terms of infrastructures, totalling approximately EUR 15 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the relevant institutions within the European Union, and particularly the Commission, to take account of the scale of the destruction and to launch specific projects to remedy the damage caused to the infrastructures. We also ask that adequate measures be taken to provide effective and rapid aid to the people affected by this catastrophe and to the regional government to repair the damage that was caused.</p>

Europe"s response in every instance has been rapid and united. This has allowed us to alleviate some of the devastation and bring a little hope to the victims. Clearly, the extreme circumstances affecting Columbia were aggravated by the destruction of infrastructures, which delayed the arrival of aid and the implementation of the emergency plans. It is therefore extremely regrettable that some unscrupulous people are exploiting the tragedy to rob, steal and trade in the scarce resources that were already in the region or that were able to get through.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, these regrettable facts must not overshadow the heroic acts or the excellent example of civic‐mindedness demonstrated by the non‐governmental organisations, the civilian population, anonymous individuals and the army, who are all involved in the recovery and rescue operations. We must highlight their positive responses, as well as the rapid reaction of ECHO and the European Commission in distributing the aid that is so important at the moment. I congratulate them on that.</p>
<p class="contents">After the damage has been assessed, we will have to follow up the present project with a further programme aimed at helping the recovery of those regions that have been totally devastated. Unfortunately, we can do nothing for those who have disappeared apart from extending our condolences to their families. Indeed, there is very little we can do to predict other earthquakes. However, we can see to it that the donations from European and other countries are used as transparently and effectively as possible so as to prevent any doubts about embezzlement or the misuse of the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that this resolution supports the commitment made by President Pastrana to combat corruption. We call on his government to make every effort to guarantee security in the region and respect for human rights.</p>

In my view, the same thing has happened with this earthquake in Columbia as happened with Hurricane Mitch. As usual, it is the poorest people that are affected. More than 1 000 people have died and many have been injured. In my opinion, we must first of all welcome the rapid response of the European Commission in releasing EUR 1.5 million, which is a considerable amount, and its work in collaboration with non‐governmental organisations such as the Red Cross, Oxfam and others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the European Commission to guarantee, in some way, that the aid sent reaches those who are genuinely affected. On previous occasions, a certain section of the population has taken advantage of the confusion – as is now the case – and exploited the breakdown in public order to use or sell goods that were intended for those who were most severely affected. There have also been cases where the aid was not distributed as it should have been and did not reach those most in need. So the European Commission can perhaps play an important role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also welcome the fact that Mr Pastrana has made a commitment to eliminate corruption and that while those most in need are receiving aid, human rights are being respected in Columbia.</p>

It is not the first time that Colombia has been hit by such a great disaster, and on this occasion it appears to have occurred in a part of Colombia with relatively few problems. It is all the more tragic that a region inhabited by people who, though dependent on help, had hitherto managed to eke out a decent living, has now been struck by such a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Our urgent plea to the Commission is that it should cut through the red tape wherever possible, that it should ensure as far as possible that the aid goes directly to the people in need. We are pleased that action has been taken so quickly, since we often criticise Colombia here. It is our biggest headache in several respects, as you well know, Commissioner. I believe that if we can take this occasion to show clearly to Colombia and President Pastrana that we are also capable of constructive intervention when practical humanitarian assistance is needed, we shall have achieved a great deal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, in joining in the expressions of sympathy for the victims of the Colombian earthquake, let us ensure that the European Union provides the long‐term assistance required to help people rebuild their lives. Still today the communities affected lack basic storage containers for clean water, have too few latrines or waterproof shelters and not enough equipment for food preparation or tools to help clear and reconstruct their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">Barefoot children lack shoes to climb over the rubble of their former homes, and lives have been destroyed. Though agencies like Oxfam are seeking to help 8 000 families per month, over 400 000 people have lost their belongings or their livelihoods. We must learn the lessons too, for despite the early announcement of assistance which we welcome, no international aid had arrived locally a full 48 hours after the earthquake struck.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in a situation which should unify the disparate groups in the Colombian conflict for absolutely clear humanitarian reasons, I have to express disbelief at reports that paramilitaries may have used the disaster to cover the killing of human rights defenders in the NGOs in Colombia and that it may have been the pretext for withdrawing a bill condemning forced disappearances at an extraordinary session in the Colombian Parliament last week. We call on President Pastrana not simply to attack fraud and corruption but also to promulgate that bill.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – The twenty‐fifth of January is a date which will be etched in the memory of the Colombian people but, regrettably, for the wrong reasons. It was a tragedy of immense proportions, as has already been pointed out, resulting in over one thousand deaths and many thousands more being injured.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that the Commission is to be congratulated on the speed with which it responded to the crisis and in particular the way in which it cooperated with NGOs in the region. However, the aid sent from the European Union and other donor countries is a mere token, given the scale of the destruction and suffering, and particularly in view of a statistic mentioned by Mr Howitt: almost half a million people have lost their homes and their belongings. Therefore, a very comprehensive aid and development programme is required to meet the long‐term needs of the country and its people. It is vitally important that, if this aid is forthcoming, it is properly coordinated and channelled to those who need it most.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution is right to point out the danger of corruption and the need to eliminate it. I welcome, as does the resolution, President Pastrana's commitment to ensure that this does not happen. The resolution is also right to point out that, in trying to restore public order, it is vitally important that human rights are not violated.</p>

Every month we could discuss the latest human rights violations, the paramilitaries, attacks on the Indios and the black population, people driven from their homes and the disappearance of individuals. This time, however, the cause of our concern is what we call a natural disaster, namely the earthquake in the city of Armenia. It has heaped untold suffering on the population, and I do not propose to repeat everything my honourable colleagues have already said on the subject. Nevertheless, the natural disaster has been compounded by a home‐made disaster in the form of corruption and incompetence, partly within the Colombian government apparatus, which are hindering the effort to ensure that help reaches the victims and reaches them quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be particularly worried by reports that the allegedly rapid assistance provided by the European Union has failed to arrive in many places. There is an urgent need to find out how accurate this information is. An official report on this matter is urgently required. In the wake of the earthquake, the paramilitaries have launched a campaign to annihilate human rights activists. Politicians and others at home and abroad insist that it is high time President Andrés Pastrana took decisive action. Alas, we have seen too little of that. Here too, there is an urgent need for the Commission to demand that the Colombian Government act to stamp out these violations of human rights in the aftermath of the earthquake.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, dealing first with the situation in the Canary Islands, the Commission is well aware of the terrible storms which hit the islands between 6 and 9 January. I am grateful for the further information supplied by the honourable Members in their resolution and also in the speeches that have been made. As far as the issue of bananas is concerned, I am well aware of the particular role that industry plays in the economy of the Canary Islands and have particular sympathy for what has occurred, coupled with the other problems which we dealt with last night.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express the Commission's sympathy and support for the local population affected by the storms. We are very sensitive to the difficulties that have arisen as a result and we will be looking carefully at the situation as a whole in the light of the instruments and regulatory provisions that may be available to give assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">So that those involved can make a proper study for the Commission, what we would like the Spanish authorities to do, is to provide, as soon as possible, detailed information about the nature of the severe weather, its impact on production and production potential in the region as well as the damage caused to the infrastructure. If we receive a formal request from the Spanish Government at the next meeting of the monitoring committees for structural assistance in the Canary Islands and the Objective 1 Community Support Framework for Spain, we will look into the possibilities of reprogramming current structural assistance in partnership with the national and regional authorities as well as any allocation from other resources available as a contribution to repairing the infrastructures damaged by the storms in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the situation in Colombia, preliminary official figures show that the number of dead has risen to over 900, of whom 582 are in the Department of Quindio and the number of injured to approximately 3 400, and 200 000 persons are homeless. Clearly the immediate priority is to respond to the emergency needs of the most vulnerable sections of the population throughout the region hit by the disaster. A detailed needs assessment confirms that it is essential to provide temporary shelter, food, blankets, kitchen utensils, medicines and chlorine as a matter of urgency. Pending a more exhaustive analysis of needs, a relief programme, amounting to EUR 1.5 million has so far been prepared by ECHO. The Commission was able to announce on 26 January a timely contribution to international relief efforts, and I am grateful for the kind words that have been spoken this afternoon about what the Commission has been able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">This first contingency plan is being implemented by various European NGOs in cooperation with the Colombian Red Cross. ECHO is considering the adoption of a further relief programme for the victims of the earthquake. In the context of their mission to Colombia next week, the Commission services will begin to study possibilities for the long‐term rehabilitation of the earthquake areas. But I would add that we fully share the view expressed in the European Parliament that President Pastrana's government must take steps to restore public order and combat corruption, whilst fully respecting human rights, and should ensure that the killing and kidnapping of human rights activists and of local NGO workers is fully investigated and the results of any such investigation are acted upon with firmness and speed.</p>
