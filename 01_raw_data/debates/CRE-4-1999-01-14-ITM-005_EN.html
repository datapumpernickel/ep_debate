<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, during the last part‐session, as you know, we held a very comprehensive and detailed debate on Iraq and the American and British air strikes. Our present discussion is not intended as a repeat of that debate, but is designed to deliver the following clear message: in this House, among the European population and throughout the world there has been perfectly understandable criticism of the bombing raids by the United States and Britain. That, however, does not mean that we either understand, tolerate or condone what Saddam Hussein and his regime are doing in Iraq, particularly to their own population.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say quite clearly that the defence of the so‐called no‐fly zones in Iraq is absolutely necessary and warranted, especially for the protection of the Kurds and Shiites. However widely opinions may differ on the events surrounding the air strikes, we are firmly behind the defence of the no‐fly zones.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Kurdish organisations reached an agreement in Washington. We in this Parliament wish to urge the Kurdish organisations to uphold this agreement, to set aside the argument that interests no one – except perhaps some Kurdish political leaders, but certainly not the Kurdish population and certainly not the Western world – to cooperate and to represent very clearly the interests of the Kurds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we seek to draw attention to humanitarian issues, to the question of humanitarian aid for Iraq, especially the population of the no‐fly zones. In addition, we should do everything possible to ensure that the entire population suffers as little as possible from the policies of Saddam Hussein, from military actions and from the sanctions. I believe that sums up our concern. We want to help the population, not the regime. That is what we wish to re‐emphasise today.</p>

My group regrets that the bombings were necessary, but under the circumstances we support the US/British action. It was Saddam Hussein himself who flouted the UN resolutions, who refuses to allow UNSCOM to do its work, and who represses his own people and threatens his neighbours with his weapons. It was Saddam Hussein who broke the agreement with Kofi Annan.</p>
<p class="contents">The bombings were right, and this sort of action could again be justified in future if the Iraqi leader continues down the same path. We must uphold the UN resolutions, and we must uphold UNSCOM and ensure that it can continue its work. Campaigns to undermine a just and consistent policy towards Saddam must be stopped. If we give in to this dictator, we are not just undermining the international rule of law, we are also tolerating repression and threats. The Union must adopt a hard line <span class="italic">en bloc</span> . The no‐fly zones must be maintained, and the people of Iraq must be helped, of course. Saddam"s policy of starving his people for his own political gain must be unmasked as the inhuman policy it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must be prepared to send food aid if Saddam agrees to let his people be helped, but we must send it only through independent organisations. Saddam must not be allowed to claim these measures as his own doing.</p>

It is perfectly clear that the provocations are starting again, that the actions by the Iraqi side, or rather Saddam Hussein's side, are continuing, with the result that there is a serious risk of war on the horizon. Saddam Hussein does what he wants, showing utter contempt for everyone. The very fact that he has spurned the ‘food for oil' programme is itself clear proof that he does whatever he pleases with the Iraqi people. One simple fact should not be forgotten: this man comes from the town of Tikrit and is only interested in the Tikrit tribe; all others are only slaves who are used as cannon fodder.</p>
<p class="contents">Saddam Hussein is essentially an Arab version of what Hitler was in our part of the world. He has exactly the same personality profile and pursues exactly the same type of policy, which is why there will be no peace until he has been replaced, until a different government is at the helm. Actions that signal a real will to replace him are therefore entirely justified. That is why I have been critical of the air strikes, which are a futile gesture. Missiles were fired, the people were terrified, but Saddam Hussein was not harmed; on the contrary, the air strikes gave him an opportunity to strengthen his position still further and aroused worldwide suspicion that the purpose of the whole escapade was to divert attention from certain embarrassing events in the United States. I even saw in one of our newspapers that they were calling the missiles ‘Monica'.</p>
<p class="contents">We should perhaps bring out that point more clearly in the resolution, or at least in the discussion on the resolution. For that reason, if the House adopts the resolution, which is a good one, it should reject the three amendments, the only real purpose of which is to undermine and water down this resolution. That is important if we want to send a clear message.</p>

However, we are living in a theatre of the absurd. It is true that the European Council has not outlined the Union's attitude to the crisis, but we ought once more to note the contempt for the Security Council shown by those who decided to go ahead with the bombardments, as well as the fact that the choice of non‐military targets, the deaths of non‐combatants and children, who are in any case dying of hunger, have only played into the hands of a cruel dictator, whose position has been strengthened far more than it has been adversely affected by all this. The fact that Saddam Hussein backs his authority with weapons given to him by the West does nothing more than to highlight our distinct lack of conscience. If we also take into account the curiously convenient timing of the bombardments to coincide with the American President's personal problems, matters become even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, it must be concluded that what we need is a common foreign policy of the utmost credibility and consistency, one which may often coincide with American policy but will never be an appendage of it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kerr </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, let me do a rather unusual thing in the European Parliament and respond to the previous four speakers, not a thing that people often do. All four of them, in different ways, criticised the US and British bombing of Baghdad last month. I have to say to them: if you believe that, why is it not in your joint resolution? We too should be condemning that bombing, as indeed most of the people of the European Union did when it happened last month. As one of the speakers pointed out, it was mostly to do with American domestic affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Greens deplore the bombing. As the speakers have said quite rightly, it strengthens Saddam Hussein, it does not weaken him. The real policies to weaken Saddam are to back the democratic movements inside Iraq, to lift the sanctions, to help the people restore democracy. That would be the quickest way of getting rid of Saddam. Some of us have been around for a long time and have opposed Saddam from the start, when Christian Democrat and Socialist governments around the world were selling him arms and strengthening him. Let us have a little consistency here in terms of historical perspective, something which Mr von Habsburg is certainly capable of. Let us say that we should be maintaining our support for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I want to deplore the role of the British Government in this. Mr Blair again displayed, despite his warm words about Europe, his lack of commitment. He is the man who is going around saying that we need a common European defence policy, but at the first sign of action from the US Mr Blair was there announcing his support for the bombing even before the US announced the bombing was happening. If he is serious about a common foreign European defence policy then he has to demonstrate that by action as well as words.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the British Foreign Secretary who was previously a leading supporter of CND in Britain, it is a disgrace that he attaches his name and support to that action as well.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us support the Green amendments and let us mention the role of UNSCOM, which has been exposed as a conduit for the CIA. Let us have an investigation into that issue, which needs to be dealt with before UNSCOM can go back to Iraq with any authority.</p>

I think that however much we may all regret that it has been necessary to take further military action against Iraq, it must be perfectly clear that the person most responsible is Saddam Hussein who, as previous speakers have said, ruthlessly continues to hold his people to ransom, as can be clearly seen from the way in which he blocked the oil for food programme, bringing further suffering for the Iraqi people. That said, I would like to express our group"s support for the call for the Council to try to define an EU position on this issue.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission is very concerned about the events that followed the air strikes of 16 and 19 December 1998. Naturally, the Commission and the Member States fully support the implementation of the ‘oil for food" programme, which is administered by the United Nations. This allows the sale of oil up to a value of USD 5 000 million over six months, in order to obtain humanitarian supplies and spare parts and equipment for the oil‐producing plants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the fact that the UN Security Council renewed this ‘oil for food" programme on 24 November 1998 for a further six months. We are obviously concerned at the slow rate at which the humanitarian aid and spare parts are being supplied, and we hope that the Iraqi Government will give its full support to the application of this programme and establish favourable conditions for its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Gulf War in 1991 the European Union has been the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, having given aid to the value of EUR 200 million. ECHO earmarked EUR 10 million for the first eight months of 1998 and another EUR 4 million for the period from October 1998 to 1999. Our commitment, and that of the European Union, is to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people, and this is what will continue to guide the Commission"s actions, in line, of course, with the Council mandate and decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must point out that the Iraqi Government is creating a lot of problems for us because of the restrictions it is imposing on non‐governmental organisations. This attitude may well threaten the implementation of humanitarian aid programmes financed by the European Union.</p>

They are the cause of the poverty and misery of the Angolan people and they are ensuring the prosperity of the arms traffickers and the corrupt politicians. The number of mines that appear secretly in the night is double that of the mines opened during the day. The masses of humanitarian aid, including food, seem to be a drop in the ocean for the people who are desperately in need.</p>
<p class="contents">The shooting down of two cargo planes chartered by MONUA, causing the death of 23 people, represented a new level of disregard for all the international agreements and institutions. The war has been rekindled from the ashes of the Lusaka protocol, clearly demonstrating the failure of the UN mission responsible for overseeing its implementation. The tolerance needed to consider the Angolan problem in a balanced manner and with equal respect for all the parties involved has been exhausted. We know that the government excels in corruption and incompetence.</p>
<p class="contents">But the main party guilty of this carnage is UNITA. This organisation of Jonas Savimbi, which recently made nearly four billion dollars on the world diamond market, has reinforced its military positions on the ground and its level of equipment. It has not disarmed or facilitated the extension of the state administration and it has disregarded all the accords and all the previous resolutions of the UN Security Council. The latter has just passed another resolution in order to restrict the satellite communications controlled by UNITA and to prevent the trading of diamonds. The patience of the international community is wearing thin. There are powerful economic and geo‐strategic interests supplying this machinery of war. It is time to say that we have had enough. Those responsible for this conflict must be charged with crimes against humanity. Plundering and prospering on Angola"s God‐given wealth, leaving millions of war and famine victims to die, is a crime against humanity.</p>

We have seen a peace process break down. The Angolan Government, whose legitimacy is doubtful given its failure to complete the presidential election process, has tried to politically and physically destroy those who should have been its partners, and has forced UNITA to take action in self‐defence. That is the current situation. It is a tragic situation because meanwhile the Angolan people are languishing in unspeakable poverty, while a few of the supposed élite are sharing the oil resources that they have seized.</p>

<p class="contents">Much‐needed humanitarian supplies have been cut off after the disgraceful shooting down of two UN planes, whose personnel are still unaccounted for. The son of the pilot of the first plane was on board the second, which illustrates the tragedy as far as those engaged on missions of mercy are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Every possible effort must now be made to end this war and sanctions must be tightened. In particular, action must be taken to prevent UNITA from finding any market for the diamonds which have been used to buy arms and supplies, and De Beers and all other traders must be made to verify their sources of supply and to ensure no monies whatsoever get through to fund this war. Peace cannot be achieved by armed hostilities and there must be a return to the Lusaka protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon both belligerents to cooperate <span class="italic">immediately</span> with the UN in seeking to establish the fate of the occupants of the UN planes which were shot down.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of the long‐suffering people of Angola, it is vital that the UN, subject of course to the safety of its personnel, continues to be involved in Angola. We appeal to the Commission to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid and, when it is possible, with the clearing of mines. This war is a major disaster and all possible power must be mobilised to restore peace at long last.</p>

Such hopes had been raised many times before. Years ago, Jonas Savimbi was invited here to our Parliament and promised to make peace. Then he took up arms, and the country was plunged into war again. Four years ago there was the Lusaka protocol, an agreement that we saw as the basis for many years of peace. We have been there with various delegations from the European Parliament, and we have seen weapons being surrendered in Huambo, for example. We parliamentarians, however, criticised the fact that the weapons being surrendered were arms from the Second World War, not the weapons that had been used in the civil war. In other words, UNITA has been pulling the wool over our eyes for years; they used a cease‐fire to keep the lid on the civil war to some extent over a period of several years, but this civil war scenario was always on their minds, and they wanted to pursue it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must take serious note of the UN Security Council resolution, which calls for the enforcement of sanctions against UNITA. We must take it seriously in two respects. First of all, there is a need to ensure that UNITA can no longer mine diamonds and buy modern weapons with the proceeds from their sale. Secondly, these diamonds must not find their way into the European Union, be marketed here and provide the capital for these arms purchases. So it is up to the Member States not to let these diamonds from Angola enter their markets and to take steps to prevent their sale in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, as in every war situation, we have a suffering population, a population sucked into the war, generally against their will. In such cases, Commissioner Marín, it is our duty to keep providing humanitarian aid wherever possible, wherever the people who want to administer that aid are not endangered. So that it can be administered, I believe it is essential for us to continue the efforts we have been making to ensure that landmines are cleared, to support the removal from that country of the most barbaric weapons in existence. We should also support the rehabilitation effort. We visited rehabilitation workshops and can confirm that they are working well. I believe that both humanitarian aid in general and the specific projects are a very important asset to the suffering population, as well as a good and vital contribution by the European Union, by the Commission, Parliament and the Council – the budgetary authority and the executive.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hory </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, our group has no more sympathy than Mr Nordmann for the Angolan regime, for its internal practices inherited from an Africanised Sovietism, or even for the shameless manner in which it is now interfering in regional affairs. However, the fact remains that the truth does need to be established and that we do not feel that it is fair to apportion equal blame to the government and to Jonas Savimbi"s uprising, for restarting a civil war for which UNITA bears the overwhelming responsibility, notably by seizing land and towns that in theory had been restored to government authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we do not think that it is fair to suggest, as in the initial Liberal text, a European boycott of Angolan oil and diamonds. We feel that it would be much more appropriate to check whether those products are in fact being exported by the Angolan State and not by UNITA, which is using them as a means of ruining both its country and the peace agreements that it has signed. With regard to those agreements, which were made reluctantly and were never really applied, it is reasonable to demand a return to the Lusaka protocol. We believe that peace needs to be completely rebuilt following a prior and very serious warning to UNITA, and that this can be done by a new conference in which European Union diplomacy could finally have an opportunity to assert itself.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Girão Pereira </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, our colleague, Mrs van Bladel, who cannot be present due to family reasons, has asked me to make a statement. After the part‐session in December 1997, through both an urgent debate and questions to the Council, she asked for steps to be taken to prevent a war in Angola. On three occasions she tabled motions for resolutions that were not accepted by this House, and she therefore considers that Parliament must also bear responsibility for the current situation in Angola. She also says that, in her opinion, the deep mistrust between the government and UNITA, which has a historical basis, was aggravated by the 1992 massacres and that this is the fundamental reason for the conflict in Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I believe that the Angolan problem is basically a question of trust, and the climate of distrust is the fault of both sides, not just of UNITA. It must be said that many clauses of the Lusaka protocol were also flouted by the MPLA Government. For example, 700 000 weapons were not collected from the civilian population and were consequently used for the bloodshed in 1992. The second round of elections was not held. The armed forces – except for those of UNITA – were not confined to barracks. The reorganisation of the police force was not carried out. The presence of the United Nations was not welcomed as was promised. The national symbols – the flag and anthem – were not changed and are still those of the MPLA party. The mercenaries were not returned to their countries and, in defiance of the agreement, the government continues to buy arms, particularly from Russia, which is a member of the troika and the UN Security Council. Compliance with these clauses would have led to mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">But much more serious is the fact that, the state administration having been extended, this consists not of administrative officials but of the police and the army, which are destroying all the UNITA headquarters and killing or arresting all the leaders of this organisation. In the meantime, a fictitious UNITA is being created in Luanda. The UN representative was prevented from talking with the real and historic UNITA and the mistrust has grown.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not representing anyone, only my conscience and my beliefs. I wanted to relate these facts because the dualistic attitude of always accusing just one of the parties does not seem right to me. This is not how problems of war are resolved. Sanctions will not bring peace to Angola. Only an atmosphere of trust can do that, which this House can help to build.</p>

It has not abided by the election results, it has prevented the demilitarisation of its forces and the extension of the state administration to the whole territory and it has disregarded the Lusaka protocol and the recommendations of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we note that the rearmament of this organisation has only been possible due to clear disregard for the international embargo, making it necessary for the European Union and the whole international community to apply and reinforce the sanctions. The proposal made today by the Commission to investigate the diamond trade that is financing UNITA"s war effort is therefore welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The incredible and disgraceful episode of the shooting down of two MONUA planes in territory occupied and controlled by UNITA together with the fact that hundreds of people have been killed and thousands left homeless by the resumption of this war form the basis for our demands. We want the weapons to be silenced, the peace process to be restarted, UNITA to agree to abide by the Lusaka protocol and the UN decisions, and the UN to decide to extend the mandate of MONUA in order to secure the conditions needed to help the refugees and to proceed with the emergency food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that, in view of UNITA"s continued disregard for the UN decisions, the international community will have to act more firmly. If not, it may be accused of having two different responses in accordance with the location of the conflicts and the convenience of certain countries. Action must be taken to ensure peace and to help a people tortured by the permanent war waged by one organisation – UNITA – which is becoming increasingly irresponsible and more terrorist‐like in its activities.</p>

Although I support the substance of the resolution, it is unfortunately very one‐sided. It depicts UNITA as the only villains of the piece. This obscures the fact that there is actually a cruel dictatorial regime in power in Luanda and that both sides should really be treated alike, as they are in fact treated in some respects by the United Nations. It is not enough to condemn the trade in diamonds, Mr Telkämper; you should also be condemning the oil trade, such as the sale of oil from the Kabinda province, occupied by the government, which, without any compunction, brings in foreign troops to exercise its power in the province. This oil trade ought to be stopped in exactly the same way as we are now calling for a halt to the trade in diamonds. I believe it is important that both sides are treated equally. That is the only way for us to remain credible here.</p>

The warring factions are once again squandering the country"s wealth and reducing the people to penury. It is not fair to blame just one side for this – the government and the army must share some of the guilt. They have failed to provide stability and are proving extremely two‐faced. We must not allow ourselves to be distracted by political tricks and stratagems. In my view, neither side is willing to make any serious efforts to achieve lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do to try to stop the spiral of violence? I hope that the United Nations will not relinquish its efforts and that MONUA will stay on after 26 February. The international community must continue to provide support, but it will not be easy to maintain donors" commitment to Angola. We must try, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, a point of order.

<p class="contents">It also agrees that UNITA bears the main responsibility for the resumption of fighting and that it obtains funds through illegal trade in diamonds. The Commission does not have the necessary resources to carry out an investigation into this illegal trade, but we will nevertheless forward Parliament"s concern on this issue to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the European Union will only be able to adopt further sanctions through a UN Security Council resolution. In order to try to help the Angolan people the Commission"s services have monitored the situation as closely as possible, and our monitoring of the European Union"s cooperation will include, among other things, an analysis of the possible redeployment of the aid that the Union is currently providing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union"s aid will undoubtedly depend on the specific possibilities on the ground. As Mr Telkämper rightly pointed out, this aid includes mine clearance. However, although this work has not been brought to a complete standstill, it has been restricted by the military operations, and this has meant that it is less safe for the teams that are working in Angola to clear the mines.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has, of course, allocated and financed humanitarian aid to help the more vulnerable sections of the Angolan population in various areas. The implementation of these programmes has also been partially affected by the deterioration of the political and military situation following the resumption of the armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The suspension of aid flights by the United Nations after the serious incidents that took place – the shooting down of aircraft – has meant that practically no humanitarian aid can reach the areas most affected by the fighting.

The people of Indonesia are entitled to this. The government must understand that democracy and human rights are essential elements for giving fresh impetus to economic renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union wants to help Indonesia, but it must also take steps to help itself. When will it release all its political prisoners, including Xanana Gusmao? When will the repressive measures in areas such as East Timor, Aceh and Irian Jaya be stopped? I hope that the new government will start to work in a genuinely democratic manner and will install a new, legitimate authority that is able to take action. Indonesia still has a long way to go, as does East Timor.</p>

The developments in Indonesia had led to the belief that the conditions were being created for the negotiation of peaceful solutions. However, this was merely cosmetic. Despite President Habibie having recognised the special status of East Timor owing to its profound religious and cultural differences, nothing has changed in the attitude of Indonesia towards the Timorese. This is despite pre‐negotiation agreements having been reached in order to demonstrate the good faith of the parties and despite negotiations having been started.</p>
<p class="contents">The disproportionate and aggressive military presence is continuing and has now assumed the role of maintaining order and carrying out criminal investigations in the place of the police force and an independent judicial system. The military are responsible for new acts of violence, new disappearances and new political imprisonments, and recently in Alas, the hope of the Timorese died along with a still unspecified number of people.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have said, this motion for a resolution is extremely urgent and opportune. Its most important elements are the call for the immediate opening of an inquiry under the aegis of the UN to establish the identity of those directly responsible for committing these crimes and the call for negotiations to find a rapid solution involving the democratisation of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first ten years of occupation, 200 000 Timorese disappeared. It needed journalists to witness a massacre for international consciences to be aroused. We must hope that more massacres are not needed for the UN resolutions to be complied with. It is time to demand that Indonesia respects human rights, it is time to end the suffering of the Timorese and it is time to submit the dictator Suharto and the military personnel responsible to the force of international justice. We cannot have two levels of response and two approaches, as demonstrated by the desire of some people to condemn Pinochet and to absolve Suharto.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the greater isolation of Indonesia due to the change in the official position of the Australian Government on East Timor, applauded by almost all the Australian political parties and criticised only by the Indonesian Government. Indonesia is becoming increasingly isolated in its claim to continue its military occupation and in its attempts to force the integration of East Timor into its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the fresh outbreak of human rights abuses. Since the crackdown against the civilian population in Alas in November, the news reaching us from East Timor, despite being diluted by the censure of the military authorities, has contained worrying signs of repeated human rights abuses. We have also been informed of the creation of armed popular militias by the military, which is attempting by force to sow the seed of terror among those opposed to integration into Indonesia. Bishop Ximenes Belo recently confirmed the arrival in the capital of East Timor of thousands of Timorese who have been forced out of their houses through violence and terror.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the refusal to accept a visit from a delegation from this House. The Intergovernmental Group on East Timor met yesterday to assess the letter from the Indonesian ambassador refusing visas for Members to visit East Timor. This refusal is indicative of their fear of this House, which is a shrine for freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not give up and we believe that the European Parliament should continue to cooperate through the motions for resolutions it has approved and through the one before us today, which we are proposing jointly with colleagues from other parties. We are sure that, with tenacity, persistence and courage, the path of history can be directed towards respect for the individual and for freedom rather than towards tyranny, violence and disregard for the most basic human rights.</p>

The European Parliament has always supported the UN resolutions, and now is a good opportunity to focus attention on them again and put this issue back on the international agenda. As has rightly been pointed out, Australia, the only country to have recognised the annexation of East Timor, has changed its position. The new thinking that is rapidly gaining ground at all levels of society in Indonesia could also mean new hope for East Timor. The Indonesian Government is now coming under increasing pressure to improve democracy and to recognise the independence and right to self‐determination of East Timor and other areas whose traditional identity has come under threat from Indonesia, such as Irian Jaya.</p>

I must also applaud the fact that the Council has already stated its position on this matter. I believe that the Commission has done so too. This House has also had an important role to play in the debate on this issue by highlighting the problems of Timor and the violations of human rights. Obviously we support this motion for a resolution but I regret that it does not contain a proposal made by Mr Janssen van Ray that, at the time of the elections in Indonesia, a referendum should be held in East Timor on self‐determination. I believe that self‐determination is the path that will have to be followed and for which this House must continue to fight.</p>

This has occurred periodically as a result of the persistence and insistence needed to ensure that we never forget this people"s heroic struggle over twenty years for their right to self‐determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in addition to the basic need to keep this issue alive, there are always new reasons provided by Indonesia – due to its military occupation and repression – to justify this insistence and repetition. The current reasons are the recent events in Alas and the violent military repression by Indonesia. We must be informed of the extent and consequences of this. We therefore repeat the demand for inquiries and visits to East Timor, which Indonesia has refused this House since November 1991. We also denounce the manoeuvre caused by Indonesia"s abject weakness, which it is trying to hide. This manoeuvre involves agreeing to the principle of self‐determination but it is accompanied by the assumption of Timor as a province of Indonesia, coinciding with a mock referendum at the time of the Indonesian elections next June.</p>

I am most concerned that force has been used against peaceful demonstrators and that no progress has been made in freeing political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish in particular to speak about East Timor. There too repression has increased alarmingly. There is also reliable information that military power has been increased to a greater extent than official sources would have us believe. Fortunately, the European Union has recently sat up and started to take notice of East Timor and it was with satisfaction that we noted the conclusions on East Timor reached at the Vienna summit, for example. Information received only recently reveals that Australia"s attitude has also changed for the better with regard to East Timor"s future. The aim must be to cautiously set the scene for a national referendum on the future of East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Commissioner Marín whether European policy on East Timor is becoming more active on specific issues. For example, would it be conceivable to have an East Timor office in the European Union, in the same way that the Americans have a Kosovo office? It would not need to be a fully‐fledged diplomatic mission if the matter were deemed too delicate. Secondly, I would like to stress that the forthcoming parliamentary elections on 7 June in Indonesia require European Union Member States and the Union itself to undertake to send people as observers, not just parliamentary observers but observers from voluntary organisations too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to inform you that on behalf of the East Timor Solidarity Group I am at this very moment engaged in negotiations with the Indonesian Government so that Members of Parliament might send an unofficial delegation to East Timor.</p>

It is probably still too early to be able to say that we are optimistic about the outcome, but we cannot fail to welcome the start of the referendum process which may mean the achievement of self‐determination for the people of that region.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is vital for the European Union to urge the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front to cooperate fully with the United Nations in the holding, without further delay, of a free, fair and impartial referendum on self‐determination for this region, which has witnessed so much fighting and suffering in the past.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McGowan </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the European Union stands for democracy, human rights, self‐determination, or nothing whatsoever. There is a real possibility that the United Nations may decide to pull out of illegally‐occupied Western Sahara at the end of this month and at this moment in time Kofi Annan is preparing a report to submit to the Security Council by 22 January. I last had the privilege of meeting him in Algeria in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been consistent in its support for self‐determination and an end to the conflict. I would like to thank in particular Mr Marín for the work he has done and give thanks for the humanitarian support and for the commitment to logistic support, as we approach a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the eve of the end of this conflict that has caused so much suffering over 20 years, but we know that the problem today – and this is the view of the United Nations – is that Morocco is yet again up to its tricks of trying to delay and to block an agreement. Morocco – present again of course in the gallery – cannot be bothered to have meetings with certain people in the European Parliament but is very effective in lobbying, in corrupting and even in acts of burglary in this building. It is Morocco which is holding up a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament can do even more. I expect even more from you, Mr Marín – you know so much about this issue and you have been open to dialogue with Morocco and the Polisario Front. Do not let the people of the Western Sahara down. Let us make sure that we are fully behind the United Nations and the commitment of Kofi Annan and James Baker and that we can see an end to this conflict.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Telkämper </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, one difference between Angola and the Western Sahara is that there is a cease‐fire in the Western Sahara. A cease‐fire, however, is still a step short of peace. One of the last colonial conflicts is being waged there. Since the Spaniards withdrew and the Moroccans occupied the country, this means that the old colonial policy has become Europeanised, and I therefore believe that the European Union has an obligation here and a responsibility for this part of Spain's colonial history.</p>
<p class="contents">The people who were forced to flee their homes have been living for decades in refugee camps. For years, Morocco has vetoed the idea of a referendum, which is why the discussions on the Western Sahara have had a certain sameness over the years. Now, apparently, the UN wishes to guarantee that the referendum can take place in December 1999. That was what we had hoped for, we expect it to take place this year, and Kofi Annan seems to be emphatic about this, as his last visit to the region showed.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we in the European Union are now in demand too and will have to give this process decisive political and logistic support. We call on Morocco to refrain from obstructing the registration of electors and to stop evading the issue. It would even be appropriate to encourage direct negotiations between the Sahrawi people and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Council – and the Austrian Presidency gave many encouraging signals in this matter – to ensure that the referendum is guaranteed and that the humanitarian aid is continued until then. I think we also need observers in the Western Sahara during the run‐up to the referendum, not just when it takes place. We ask the Commission to make the necessary resources available so that the referendum can be guaranteed and the humanitarian aid continued. One approach we could use relates to the forthcoming fisheries agreement with Morocco, which could be linked to the holding of the referendum. Whatever its outcome, the Commission and the Council – the troika – should guarantee that, along with the UN, the European Union will provide the necessary security for the referendum to take place. That is my plea to the German Presidency of the Council.</p>

There is also significant humanitarian aid being donated, and this should continue. However, while we are aware of this reality, a mirage is appearing in the sand dunes of the desert: the mirage of the referendum, a referendum that is seemingly never going to be held. In spite of this, we must prevent feelings of impatience on the part of the United Nations, the international community, the Polisario Front and the Moroccan Government. And we must avoid such impatience so as not to leave any deep‐rooted problems behind, problems that could lead to future conflicts or a permanent state of guerilla warfare.</p>

In November and December he went to the area, and following his meetings with the parties in the conflict, he put forward a set of recommendations in order to break the deadlock in the peace process and to implement the Houston agreements. The Polisario Front agreed to implement all of these proposals which come as an indivisible package. However, the Government of Morocco is still rejecting them. As a result of these blocking manoeuvres, it is responsible for holding up the implementation of the peace process. The United Nations Security Council has also recognised this. In its resolution of 17 December, it welcomes the agreement of the Polisario Front and urges the Government of Morocco to implement the United Nations settlement plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the home straight of the referendum process. In order to ensure that it is carried through, that it is to the holding of a referendum on self‐determination in December 1999, we have to frustrate the attempts by the Government of Morocco to block the process. The Council and the governments of the Member States can contribute to this by playing a more active role in ensuring the success of the peace process, especially by using all the means they have available to persuade the Government of Morocco to implement the proposals put forward by the Secretary‐General of the United Nations in their entirety. Could the Council not also define a common position, as was requested by the European Parliament on 10 March 1998, or at least adopt a declaration expressing its support of the United Nations?</p>

<p class="contents">I am not going to remind the Commission of something it is already aware of: the importance of the Security Council meeting and the latest resolution, which, in reality, Mr Fabra, already reflects a degree of impatience on the part of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we can be patient, and indeed the Sahrawi people have been patient, as they have been waiting endlessly for this referendum to be held. This is a very delicate situation. On the one hand, we are faced with the suffering of the Sahrawi people, while on the other hand, as a previous speaker pointed out, we know that this cease‐fire may be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this resolution, which was unanimously supported by the Security Council, we are calling on the European Commission and the Council to do the same. We want the Commission, Parliament and the Council to clearly set out in one document – in a resolution – their support for the Secretary‐General of the United Nations and for the efforts being made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you of what the Security Council says and what we are all aware of: the Polisario Front has already accepted all the measures being proposed by the Secretary‐General, and is also responding to the Houston agreements and the Secretary‐General"s proposal. We also know that Morocco is continuing to put the matter off, and is apparently still trying to wear down the people and exhaust the patience of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are very close to Morocco and we respect and admire its people and its government. We must say to the government – in a friendly but firm manner – that it has to accept the peace plan, that this situation cannot continue. This is one of our neighbouring countries and it is situated close to the European Union. All the efforts made should be dedicated to helping the development of the Moroccan and Sahrawi people.</p>

I must say, however, that I personally would have preferred this parliamentary resolution to be tabled after the Security Council resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me say that it is surely not enough for everyone to point the finger at Morocco and to blame that country for all the delays. We should perhaps correct certain fallacies that have even gained currency here in Europe. If we talk about the people who are entitled to vote in the referendum, we cannot simply exclude those who have been living in what is now the Western Sahara for a good deal more than ten years and who have effectively earned their right of residence. After all, there is also a great deal of discussion today in the various Member States of the European Union about the specific rights that people acquire by living in our countries for a certain length of time. These people cannot simply be excluded from a referendum; similarly, those who are living in the refugee camps in Algeria must also be enfranchised.</p>
<p class="contents">But allow me to add a very brief historical footnote, since there is so much talk here about colonialisation, recolonialisation and so on. The territory of the Western Sahara belonged to Morocco for many centuries before it came into Spanish possession. I could not let that go unsaid.</p>

I believe that it is necessary to repeat here some of the things that we said at that stage to the Council. Firstly, what is lacking here is any sign that the European institutions are playing a visible role in the resolution of this conflict. There is humanitarian aid; there is a presence, but it is only relative. From what we understand the United States has a greater presence. The conflict in the Sahara is more closely linked to the European Union and certain EU countries than to the United States, yet it has a more obvious presence there than we do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and in spite of what Mr von Habsburg says – although I have great respect for him – it is Morocco that has been putting up obstacles to the referendum. We must be clear on this point once and for all. I would remind you that, in principle, Western Sahara only accepted the Spanish census with an increase of 10 %, and now the Sahrawi people, in the latest proposal by Mr Baker, have accepted another 65 000 potential voters. Yet Morocco is still putting up obstacles. It seems as though the referendum is going to be delayed by another year, but this year is crucial. It is crucial because we must ensure that there are no further obstacles in the path to a fair referendum that will provide an important boost for a brave and valiant race which, under terrible conditions, educates and cares for the health of its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the European Union should set an example and try to resolve the conflict or help to resolve the conflict, and not leave Mr Baker and the United Nations to work alone. It should also support the United Nations so that Morocco does not continue to obstruct the resolution of the conflict.</p>

Naturally I would urge Members of this Parliament not to start immediately identifying the guilty and the victims in what is an ongoing and, I admit, difficult process.

<p class="contents">Several months ago, we approved a proposal for a recommendation and in December we held a debate with more than 10 questions. Today, we are discussing a motion for a resolution that has been signed by practically all the groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, the Council is maintaining its position of principle – which is important, yet easy – by saying that it supports the self‐determination of the people of Western Sahara and the United Nations resolution. But it does not dare to take the necessary second step: helping the Secretary‐General to carry out his work to ensure that the Security Council resolutions are applied, in this case by organising and holding a free referendum on self‐determination within the time specified.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we help the Secretary‐General? In my view, we can help by stating which party is putting up obstacles and preventing the international legal provisions from being fulfilled. And today that party is clearly Morocco.</p>

It is, of course, entirely unacceptable and action must be taken to combat this inhuman abuse of poverty. I think it is a pity that a recent UNICEF ‘fidadigna" report is not mentioned in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Guatemala must ratify the relevant international conventions as soon as possible, and the Union must bring pressure to bear on Guatemala to ensure that it does. What sort of government would allow its own citizens to be bought and sold? The Union must ensure that a careful watch is kept for Guatemalan children at the receiving end, so to speak, and it must also support the aid projects for statutory adoption programmes in Guatemala itself. In this the tenth anniversary year of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, measures to protect children should be given maximum publicity and should be our very top priority.</p>

I think that if we do not do whatever we can about the situation in Guatemala, the problem will spread to other countries. The threat is already there. There are other countries where we need to be on our guard, particularly at the moment in Eastern Europe. However, I am happy enough with the compromise text, because this is a specific issue of which we have a fairly clear picture, no matter how great the scale of the problem, and the Commissioner and his officials can now try to do something about it through their contacts with the Guatemalan government. The organisation that we mention, <span class="italic">Casa Alianza</span> , and its leader have revealed what is going on and are now themselves under threat. The organisation and its workers, particularly Bruce Harris, deserve Europe"s support.</p>
<p class="contents">I too regret that the UNICEF report is not mentioned, and I would add that I am also sorry – I think the liberals had something to do with this – that the resolution does not mention what I said in my original text about the need for DNA testing. The United Kingdom already requires adoptive parents to prove that it was the child"s legal parents who gave it up for adoption. At the moment bogus mothers and other poor women are being paid to go to an embassy and say that they want to give their child up. Other mothers hand their children over themselves. A DNA test such as the one the UK requires clearly shows whether it is the child"s real parents that are giving it up. I would therefore call for this DNA test to become a Europe‐wide requirement.</p>

A veritable Mafia kidnaps children, persuades poverty‐stricken women to hand over their children, forges birth certificates and sells the children abroad. Even a notary public has the power to authorise adoptions. Prices of 15 000 to 20 000 dollars per child are not unusual. Under the Guatemalan penal code, trafficking in children is not a crime and does not carry a penalty. All the countries in the region have amended their laws in recent years in order to eliminate this inhuman and exploitative practice, but Guatemala has not yet taken that step. It is now high time it did.</p>
<p class="contents">Guatemala must also proceed without delay to ratify the Hague Convention on Inter‐Country Adoption and must meet its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by promulgating its Juvenile and Adolescent Code. Adoptions are sometimes a valid last resort, but the child should remain as close as possible to its cultural and geographical roots. Adoptions, however, can never be a contribution to development aid, because development aid means creating the conditions in which children can grow up in their own countries. I urge everyone to bear that in mind.</p>

<p class="contents">Today we are discussing the adoption of Guatemalan children. There is certainly no question of condemning international adoptions, but of considering the conditions in which they are carried out. In this respect, Guatemala has become a real baby‐trafficking location, so that in 1997 it was estimated that more than two thousand children were sold at a price of 15 000 to 20 000 dollars. It is not difficult to imagine how such a lucrative activity could give rise to abominable practices on the part of the traffickers, who will stop at nothing to protect their dubious trade. They will therefore not hesitate to intimidate or even threaten those who seek to reform these adoption procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States therefore need to ensure that legal provisions on international adoption are applied, especially with regard to children from Guatemala. However, above all, we must also encourage the Guatemalan Government to be more strict in dealing with this matter, especially given that hurricane Mitch has recently increased the number of children available for adoption, which means that we should be even more vigilant.</p>

However, what is certain is that the root of the problem can often be found in the developed world, where there are well‐structured and experienced trafficking networks that are involved in the trafficking of children, women and human organs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament"s resolutions must always be objective and rigorous, particularly when they relate to friendly countries such as Guatemala. Parliament has frequently recognised the progress achieved by President Arzú"s government in consolidating the peace process, in bringing democracy to Guatemala and in consolidating the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that cases involving the trafficking of children have been uncovered in Guatemala. But this has been happening there for a long time due to the unfortunate decades of civil war that have left behind a high number of orphans. The situation has deteriorated even further as a result of the terrible consequences of hurricane Mitch.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations mission in Guatemala has the express task of ensuring respect for human rights there, and I believe it is important to highlight the fact that Guatemala forms part of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commissioner responsible, Mr Marín, is here this afternoon, and it is only fair that we recognise that, faced with the devastating effects of the hurricane, the European Commission has reacted quickly and effectively. We hope that it will soon be able to propose a rehabilitation plan for the region in accordance with the Commissioner"s statement.</p>

The most striking thing is that trafficking in children is not classified as a crime under the Guatemalan penal code and even the abduction of children merely carries a sentence of about a year, and that may be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore we do not believe international adoption can be penalised because these adoptions, if carried out through the correct channels and with guarantees for the child, almost always offer the chance of a better standard of living. Nor can we deny that international adoption constitutes an important form of international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In expressing serious concern about information reaching us that people working in Guatemala to prevent illegal trafficking in children are being subjected to threats and intimidation, we look to the Commission and the Member States to urge the Guatemalan Government to ensure that adoption procedures are carried out with the proper legal guarantees – national and international – and that the law officers combatting illegal trafficking are protected.</p>

The drugs barons, on the other hand, are earning a fortune: 80 % of the drugs sold in the US come from Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">President Pastrana has given us renewed hope and has injected fresh impetus into the peace talks. The last‐minute decision of the leader of the FARC not to attend was extremely disappointing. The Union must, of course, encourage the peace process and make its own contribution to it. Stability and peace, as everyone knows, are vital to give the economy a fresh boost.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that all our good intentions will bring results here. I would like to ask the Commissioner a question about the peace process. A number of ECHO projects are running in the Comunidades de Paz, an organisation of villages that were built a year ago at Apartadó and Rio Sucio in the north of Colombia. I was there a month ago, and I saw a sign in a field that said ‘ECHO is building a hospital here". People there told me that this had been promised eight months ago, but the money had obviously got no further than Bogota. Bogota is <span class="italic">muy, muy, muy, lejos de aqui</span> .

The dialogue held in San Vicente has given rise to real expectations and fulfills the mandate for peace which 10 million people voted for.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also point out that the FARC has understood the historic importance of the occasion and accepted the challenge to participate in the construction of this new area through dialogue. We must recognise this, just as we must recognise that there are similarities between President Pastrana"s agenda and the guerrillas" proposals. After yesterday"s meeting, the paths towards peace can be seen much more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, peace has very powerful enemies. In this case, we must condemn the paramilitary activities and crimes that are taking place. More than 100 people have been killed with the sole aim of obstructing peace. This is a direct attack on the whole of society. The will to combat paramilitary activities is crucial in order to make progress. It is equally vital to wipe out drug trafficking and corruption, and these issues are all on the agenda. However, the most important element is ensuring that the guilty are brought to justice, to ensure that human rights are guaranteed for the entire population. The paths to peace are those expressed in the mandate from the people. Their voice cannot be ignored, nor can the victims. The government is responsible for extending and strengthening the rule of law and for protecting those who are fighting for dignity and democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can also make certain requests, and I have some of my own. The first is to ask the guerrillas to free all civilian hostages, and here I would like to thank them for having freed the European development assistant Camino Villanueva. I would also like to ask the Commission, if possible, to explain how the European Union would be involved in the construction of these areas of peace. There is hope in Europe and I believe that we here can also provide a response.</p>

The murders – well over a hundred in number – committed by the paramilitaries have been another horrific reminder of the truth of that proposition. The paramilitaries are not parties to peace talks. The paramilitaries are criminal gangs that must be dissolved immediately. Their members and their paymasters must be brought to justice, and all their helpers in the administration and the armed forces must be summarily dismissed. Not until the right to life is guaranteed in Colombia will there be hope of real peace. This means that the warring factions must immediately start to apply the fundamental principles of humanitarianism. It means that the government must act to protect the victims of the conflict, including more than a million refugees, many of whom are blacks and Indios. No more impunity for lawbreakers! Reform the administration of justice, particularly the system of military jurisdiction. Agrarian reform has to be implemented, and economic and social justice must be established.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a task for the European Union too. We should be helping here, instead of competing for pole position in the export markets. We must pay fair prices and promote regional development, because peace is the reward for completing this process, not the prerequisite for launching it.</p>

We do have to ask when this circle of violence, murder, kidnapping and hostage‐taking will finally end, when the political authorities and the responsible democrats will finally be strong enough to silence the guns and stamp out corruption and drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pastrana government – and we congratulate them on this – are using the strength inherent in a new government to open negotiations with the strongest of the warring factions, with all the difficulties this involves. We can but hope that negotiations with the other groups will follow, that the paramilitary groups as well as the guerrillas will stop the kidnapping, hostage‐taking and killing and that the armed forces finally come to realise that their function is not only to defend the power of the state in a military sense, but also to defend democratic and humane practices. In this respect, not only the armed forces but also, as has been said already, the constitutional State of Colombia – assuming it wishes to become one – certainly still have a very great deal to learn, and we must help them in that learning process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is degrading for a country when its name appears at the top of such a blacklist. But it is even worse and even more horrific for its people. We call on the Colombian Government to protect the defenders of human rights and shall support their efforts to do so. We shall also support them in their quest for justice and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">During our visit to Bogota in December, we also spoke to the UN High Commissioner for Bogota, who has been an extremely courageous champion of human rights. There was a question mark over the future of her post. We very much hope that the office of High Commissioner, which is held in high esteem in Colombia, can be preserved, and I should like to ask the Commission whether it is doing everything in its power to ensure that the post will in fact be preserved.</p>

<p class="contents">An article I have here by a Columbian who works for <span class="italic">Justicia y Paz</span> can express better than we can what conditions are needed to achieve peace in Columbia, and it is not a matter of just sitting down and talking. He mentions reforming the agricultural legislation so that the land that was stolen from the peasants can be given back to them. He also talks about a law on natural resources, and the fact that four basic needs must be met: housing, health, education and employment. In other words, vital basic standards must be guaranteed to prevent the situation from continuing in this manner, not only in terms of the murders, but also in terms of a hidden war that would have the same results.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, since Thursday, 7 January, between 100 and 150 people have been killed in a series of brutal massacres carried out primarily by the AUC paramilitaries. These were not indiscriminate massacres: the paramilitaries had lists of names – in particular community activists and leaders – and executed the people on those lists. Many of the victims of the past few days were badly tortured before they were killed and most of the paramilitary attacks were in the north of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">So, whilst welcoming the peace talks between President Pastrana and the FARC guerrillas, which began on that day, Thursday, 7 January, we have to condemn the fact that the paramilitaries are seeking to sabotage these peace talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Colombian President has committed his government to taking decisive action against these illegal paramilitary forces. On Monday, 11 January, Mr Pastrana reiterated the exclusive responsibility of the state to disarm the paramilitaries in his ten‐point proposed agenda presented to the FARC. Yet this has just not happened. On the contrary, there is well documented and internationally verified evidence of active and ongoing collusion between the Colombian armed forces and these paramilitary groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commissioner, in closing this debate, whether he could commit himself to making urgent representations to the Colombian Government to discuss the need for immediate and decisive action to be taken against the paramilitary groups to protect the fragile peace process and prevent future tragic loss of life, in particular during the peace talks of these coming weeks.</p>

A civil war has been gradually developing there for more than 40 years. Two significant guerrilla groups control a third of the country and clash with the army on a daily basis. There are many paramilitary groups that are committed to instilling fear among the population by carrying out massacres, and to date they have kidnapped 1 500 people. Two peace processes have failed in recent years and thousands of people have died.</p>
<p class="contents">In the midst of this serious situation, a new opportunity for peace is emerging through an initiative by the new president, President Pastrana. In my view, this initiative encompasses the feelings of most of the Columbian people. A group of Members, including myself, recently had the opportunity to get closer to the situation and we met practically all of President Pastrana"s ministers, various social bodies and the main trade unions. The conclusion I myself reached is that there is a real and genuine desire to achieve peace. I also became aware of just how long and difficult the process will be and, above all, of the need for international support on both political and economic levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group believes that the European Parliament, and the European Union itself, can play an important role in the peace process in Columbia by adding an international dimension to the support for the process and by providing whatever help might be of use to the parties involved.</p>

For the needy, who always bear the brunt of these conflicts, the provision of humanitarian aid is essential. We want to ensure that famine does not develop in Sierra Leone and that the refugees in neighbouring countries are cared for, which means that there is a pressing need to conclude a cease‐fire in the first instance.</p>

I will therefore not dwell on these points, and, using Sierra Leone as an example, I would like to make a more general observation concerning a triple failure brought about by unstable countries: that of the UN, that of the OAU and, it must also be said, that of EU diplomacy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the UN, if a matter is not sufficiently serious in the eyes of the Americans for it to assert the right to state the rules of international law and to support this with military action, the UN goes from humiliation to rebuff to retreat, and its list of failures, from the UN peacekeepers of the former Belgian Congo to the intervention mission to Sierra Leone, must be a long one. That list will never come to an end as long as the UN does not have the permanent military resources that it needs to ensure respect of the international law that it is trying to create.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Organisation of African Unity, which is so badly named that it would be better to call it the organisation for connivance between the leaders of African States, it has decided to delegate its powers to regional authorities. Meanwhile, is it dealing with development or democratic progress that would help reduce the tension? Not at all. Since it was set up, it has been almost exclusively concerned with ensuring the respect of the old colonial borders, thus guaranteeing the continuance of its members" power structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the European Union, it must be noted that, in Sierra Leone as elsewhere, it is noticeable by its absence, as it has been unable to attach any real diplomatic influence to its economic aid. It therefore leaves the way open for the post‐colonial diplomacy of its Member States, who have in the past sometimes shown their tendency to fuel crises and, in all cases, their inability to resolve them.</p>

In fact, in the course of the last few years, the situation there has steadily deteriorated both politically and in terms of the standard of living of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of another attempt by the rebel forces to conquer the country, bloody clashes have again been taking place in the last week, resulting in another thousand victims and making life even more difficult for the civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few hours news has come through of the abduction of the Archbishop of Freetown, Joseph Hendri Ganda, after Italian missionaries had been taken hostage, one of whom, the Jesuit Father Mario Guerra, is still in the hands of the rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, the first and most urgent requirement, obviously, is to achieve an immediate cease‐fire and the release of all the hostages, and to provide for the immediate needs of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate essential is for all harassment of the civilian population to cease and for the aid workers to be able to fulfil their mission.</p>
<p class="contents">But at the same time as the legitimate government forces restore order in the country, a start must be made on the more profound work of mediation and national reconciliation which alone can provide a stable political and institutional base for the country and prevent future tragedies.</p>
<p class="contents">Here again, the role of the Union must of course be to provide humanitarian aid to meet the urgent needs of the population, including the thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries, and also to take action to promote dialogue, reconciliation and respect for human rights, if necessary through initiatives of its own.</p>

That was exactly what the UNHCR observer said about the events in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">Only recently, we have seen terrible scenes on television. They showed what Foday Sankoh"s rebel forces have described, with awful black humour, as the ‘short sleeves" and the ‘long sleeves", according to whether they cut off the arms of the civilians – including children and women – just below the shoulder or at the wrist.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the international community has a responsibility in this matter. However, the people of Sierra Leone, and particularly the political and military leaders, must find a solution to their own problem. Efforts are currently being made in this respect. It has been suggested that the leader of the rebels, whom I just mentioned, be flown from the city where he is imprisoned, Freetown, to Conakry by the Nigerians to take part in negotiations to which he would add the pre‐condition of his own release. That would indeed be a surprising turn of events. But if his freedom meant that his supporters would not act with such brutal cruelty and that the supposedly civilian government – which shoots members of the military junta without allowing them any right of appeal – would not respond in the same way, then some progress would have been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Two excellent Spanish journalists, Javier Reverte and Alfonso Armada – and I am sure there are excellent journalists in other countries – have recently published very good books on sub‐Saharan Africa, and they have asked us all to be understanding. I believe that we must be understanding, but we must also demand that the armed citizens in Sierra Leone at least behave like human beings.</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, any semblance of a state has now been lost in that zone. Armed bands, warlords, arms dealers – and especially dealers in raw materials, which this land is rich in – do as they please, riding roughshod over the most elementary human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the action taken by the European Union should draw attention to the fact that what is most important, even more important than the rule of law, even more important than democracy, is just being a state, so as to contribute to re‐establishing at least some of the minimum conditions of civil society.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, I will go through the debates in the order in which they were held.</p>
<p class="contents">I will look firstly at East Timor and Indonesia. The Commission has always supported the democratic process in Indonesia and will naturally provide assistance during the next elections in the form of an overall package. The details of this have yet to be decided, although it is a subject that is being discussed in the Council, as Mr Bertens is well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">On 8 December 1998, the ambassadors of the European Union troika in Jakarta met President Habibie to gain first‐hand information on his plans to implement the measures taken by the People"s Consultative Assembly in relation to the political and economic reforms, and, in particular, its plans to hold democratic, open, free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">President Habibie confirmed the following dates: there will be elections on 7 June 1999 and the new members of parliament will be sworn in on 29 August 1999. He had no objections to international assistance and monitoring, nor to the presence of international observers during the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as East Timor is concerned, the European Union also entirely supports the United Nations initiative to set up a permanent representation of the United Nations in that region. The European Union has frequently expressed its concern to the Indonesian authorities about the various violent incidents that have taken place in certain parts of East Timor, in which a considerable number of civilians have reportedly died. A visit to East Timor by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is planned for the beginning of February. The European Union also welcomes the creation, in January 1999, of interest sections that will enable the Portuguese to maintain a presence in Jakarta, with the possibility of free access to East Timor. The European Union is confident that a final agreement will be reached on the United Nations proposals for a statute of autonomy. In relation to other East Timor issues, we have informed Parliament on a number of occasions that there is a specific cooperation programme with East Timor, which is, for the most part, implemented through NGOs and the churches in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now go on to look at the Sahara, Colombia, the trafficking of children and Sierra Leone. Since it was decided at this morning"s sitting to review the entire working methods of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, I am sure I am going to disappoint you, as 90 % of the questions that have been asked should instead be addressed to the Council. All I can do, in fact, is to repeat what is in the common positions that have already been adopted and that you are all aware of. As a result, I am sorry if I cannot give you an adequate response to the problems relating to Western Sahara, Colombia, Sierra Leone and the trafficking of children.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Western Sahara, the European Union"s general position is based on the statement by the Presidency of the Council on 29 December last year. I will therefore pass on Parliament"s concerns to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, we are going to continue to provide humanitarian aid to help the Sahrawi population through NGOs as we have been doing. We will continue to provide food as well as medical and health assistance for the refugees. A decision on this was adopted in October 1998, as you know, and the aid being donated to the Sahrawi people now totals approximately EUR 10 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares your concerns regarding the serious problems in Guatemala involving the trafficking of children and illegal adoptions. This is indeed a totally despicable form of trafficking. We have been following this issue carefully – not only in Guatemala, but also in other countries – and, as far as Guatemala is concerned, a series of specific programmes have been implemented with a view to finding a solution, or part of the solution, for this section of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">To be specific, there is a programme in Guatemala costing EUR 2.5 million that acts on three levels. It is primarily aimed at promoting the application of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Guatemala in 1989, in the hope that the Juvenile and Adolescent Code will be implemented. In other words, the problem is not with the Convention and the Code as such, which we are helping the Guatemalan authorities to develop. Rather, the problem relates to their ability to apply them and their effectiveness in doing so, as is the case in most similar countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To make people aware of the new Juvenile and Adolescent Code, staff are being trained and preparations made for the institutions involved, including judges, the secretariat for social welfare, the attorney general"s office, and the institutions responsible for childhood and youth issues. UNICEF is naturally providing a great deal of cooperation on the Code.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts are also being made to ensure that a law on adoption is approved by the National Assembly, as this represents one of the great problems in Guatemala. It is hoped that it will cover both national and international adoptions. Legal adoption in itself is clearly not the ideal solution for poor families, but it will at least be better to have normal, legal adoptions than illegal ones. In this respect, I would also mention – not only as regards Guatemala, but in general – all the problems related to the trafficking of children, child prostitution and paedophilia, as well as other problems involving third world countries, such as the trafficking of organs. We need to look at all these issues to gain an overall impression and to deal with them under the principle of joint responsibility. However, the rich countries are the ones that adopt illegally, that take drugs, that buy organs, and so on. We cannot just look from the North to the South with a critical eye, since we know that the developed countries are the ones that facilitate this type of trade because of their advanced economic and financial situation. We must therefore redress the balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Columbia, we will forward your political arguments to the Council and provide details of what the Commission might be able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council"s position and thus the European Union"s position is set out in a statement that was made on 8 January 1999. I would once again stress that it is very difficult for the Commission to take part in such debates since, apart from telling you what you already know – that we have a Council position, which you will undoubtedly say is of no use – there is very little I can add. I therefore believe that in the future it would be a good idea for the Council to attend on these occasions so that it can hold a real political debate with you.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question from Mrs Lenz – and this is indeed a matter for the Commission – Mrs Mazarrasa has informed us that she wishes to leave, as she has been working there for two years. As you can imagine, human rights work in Columbia is very demanding, and she has therefore decided to leave. Mrs Robinson came to see us, as a commitment had been made on the part of the European Union to provide the Bogota office with funds for one year only. Since the human rights situation in Columbia was extremely distressing, we decided to provide funding for a further year and we will have to decide whether or not to continue with this. I believe that we should because the United Nations, and particularly Mrs Robinson"s office, do not have a great deal of money at their disposal. So we should provide this funding. However, I say this very cautiously because, after this morning"s debate, it is not easy for the Commission to take independent decisions. We will therefore keep Parliament informed. If you agree – and I am sure you will – then we will be able to begin to provide more funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to be very meticulous as regards your decisions. Nonetheless, we must begin to show consistency. We are approving resolutions that involve expenditure. And we cannot vote for one thing in the morning and then in the evening call for decisions that involve spending. I have told you that I agree with the proposal and that we need to continue to provide funding. But from now on, we will have to do so in the way you requested this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of continuing to provide funding, and I will put forward a proposal to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, we must look at what we can do to help the peace process. The European Union as such is not an international player in the process, although it is true that the Commission delegate was invited to the ceremony marking its beginning. The proposal we made to the previous government, and which still stands for President Pastrana – who is apparently going to visit the European Community soon – involves the implementation of an accompanying policy relating, in particular, either to internal reforms or to displaced persons and refugees. We already have some experience of this following previous conflicts in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your comments on Sierra Leone, Mr Robles Piquer, the Commission is following events there very closely, particularly the recent fighting between the rebel forces, including the Revolutionary United Front, and the soldiers from the old Sierra Leone army supported by the ECOMOG regional intervention troops. With other partners, the European Union has condemned the recent attempt by the rebels to overthrow President Kabbah"s legitimately elected government for the second time in two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has decided to give political support to President Kabbah"s government and to all those currently working to resolve this crisis through negotiation. However, as you pointed out, the truth is that the situation is changing every day. Once the situation has become clearer, the Commission will consider what practical support it can provide to help the peace negotiations. As regards the Commission"s area of responsibility, that is, the humanitarian situation, I cannot deny that, in view of the circumstances, we have been forced to evacuate all foreign citizens. And as a result, due to the extreme violence particularly in Freetown and its surrounding areas, there is no possibility of providing humanitarian assistance. I can therefore tell you that the situation in the country is impossible. The humanitarian aid situation is much better in neighbouring countries such as Liberia and Guinea, where, although the situation is not under control, it is at least somewhat easier to work.</p>

However, I do not understand why, when he then gave a list of countries where we want action to be taken, he started talking about budgets. I think that in the case of Guatemala, for example, <span class="italic">Casa Alianza</span> is already being financed by the Commission and is an active member of the European Network on Streetchildren Worldwide, which has also been funded by the Commission in the past, so it should not be a problem. The Commissioner could ring the delegation there tomorrow and tell them to approach the Guatemalan Government about it.</p>

I would therefore like the Presidency of Parliament, which you represent, to explain the situation to me, because we often debate foreign policy issues in these topical and urgent debates, and that is a matter for the Council. Therefore, what can we do as Members of Parliament, or what can Parliament itself do, to guarantee the Council"s presence at these very important debates? Perhaps there is a gap in the Rules of Procedure. If so, I would ask you to make the Presidency of Parliament aware of it so that it can examine this issue and put forward a proposal regarding the Rules to solve this problem.</p>

There is someone from the Council here taking notes. There is no one here authorised to speak on behalf of the Council. But the Council will be aware of our discussion. Until now there has been no tradition of a representative of the Council presidency being here to speak. Parliament is free at any time to ask the Council to be present. If we were to do so I suspect we would have to change the timing of urgencies because no Member State would be able to field a minister at this time on a Thursday.</p>

<p class="contents">Apart from discussing the common positions and statements approved by the Council, it is very difficult for me to add anything further. Consequently, I must point out that you have mentioned many political aspects to which I am unable to respond. That is what I meant.

But it is the Council that must take the final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Guatemala is concerned, Mrs van Putten, we do have the programme that I mentioned which deals with the children in Guatemala. However, Guatemala is not the only example of this. If my memory serves me correctly, I would say that within Latin America the same problem exists in Brazil, where there is another programme, and we also have further programmes for Columbia and four or five other Latin American countries. With the financial resources we have available, we are first of all trying to implement basic legislation, although this is quite advanced in Guatemala. Nonetheless, I would stress that the problem is more than just about having legislation; above all, it is about being able to enforce it.</p>

Now that an agreement between the government and the National Democratic Front is in force and has been endorsed on both sides, it is important that its proposals are fully implemented and that all consequential steps are taken without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that goodwill exists on both sides, but some factions which reject the NDF leadership are still not prepared to renounce conflict and a great deal of painstaking work therefore remains to be done if the peace is to be truly comprehensive and lasting. The issues of human rights, humanitarian aid, land reform and rural development need to be vigorously pursued if the agreement is to be completely successful. The Commission and the Council – and again we mention the Council – must give full support to this process and we appeal to them on this count.</p>

The Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, approved by the Government of the Philippines and the former rebels on 7 August 1998, is being respected. Socio‐economic projects, development projects, projects to restore full democracy in the country are being approved and it even seems as if human rights may be respected. So we should not only support this resolution, but we should also study the case of the Phillippines carefully, because it looks like a good example which is worth exporting.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think there is anything further to add except that we must not drop our guard, as support, and not just moral support, from the European Union is certainly still necessary if the process of democratisation is to continue and be consolidated.</p>

Foremost among these is sex tourism, the causes of which lie primarily in Europe. What we are discussing here is a resolution on the peace process in the Philippines, the process of establishing peace between the government and the National Democratic Front. This peace process should benefit the people and their country. The potentially violent disputes must not be allowed to continue; efforts for peace, social and economic reforms and land reform must come to dominate the political landscape.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights can only benefit from such efforts. They are part of this process. At least the people of the Philippines are well aware of the value of democracy. They are also aware of the value of international humanitarian conventions. There are many non‐governmental organisations in the Philippines – social and church organisations – which care for people and promote peace. I very much hope that the assistance provided by the European Union will also reach its target there too, for there is a need to mobilise all forces to assist in this complex process in a country which is, of course, already democratic, with a view to reconstructing peace and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the government and the political parties to intensify their efforts, and we call on the European Union to support these efforts. May I take this opportunity to say, Commissioner, that I am not sure whether I am entirely happy about your sudden solicitude for the Council. We are not used to that here. The point of the question I asked you before, and of many other questions besides, was to ascertain who has a say in the use of EU funds. That was the point I raised.</p>

The European Union and Parliament, of course, have also made important contributions to the peace effort. I can certainly recall visits by several delegations in the EC‐ASEAN framework, for example in the early days of Mrs Aquino's government. At that time we gave strong backing to the process. There is goodwill on both sides – on the NDFP side and on the government side – as has been said. We must support and encourage this goodwill.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that there are two especially important points. The first is the monitoring of human rights observance, and the second is the essential land reform. This takes us back to the institutional conflict between the Commission and the Council. I believe – and I should like to say this quite explicitly today, Mr Marín – that the Commission has done valuable and significant work with regard to the Philippines. It is, of course, important that projects are implemented and that there is no possibility of projects being implemented in which human rights are infringed. But that is a political issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for land reform is addressed to the Council. That is why I shall close by repeating my request that you in the Bureau, as David Martin suggested before, should ask the Council to attend these debates, to hear these messages for itself and to organise this new practice jointly with ourselves.</p>

It is particularly pleasing that this has taken place with good faith being shown on both sides and also that they have been addressing political, human rights and social and economic issues. However, it is a source of regret that latterly this process has slowed down and it is indeed a worrying development. It is vitally important that this trend is reversed and that we accelerate the progress of the peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">An important element in ensuring that this happens, as has already been said by Mr Smith in proposing the resolution, is the role of both the Council and the Commission. In this context I would certainly like to underline the proposal contained in paragraph 4 of the compromise text, which urges these two bodies to provide whatever support and assistance is necessary to facilitate the peace negotiations. In underlining that point I would ask the Members of the House to support this particular compromise resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">As a result, three projects costing a total of EUR 21 million are currently being implemented with a view to encouraging and consolidating the peace process between the Philippine Government and the NDF.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission is currently drawing up a project costing EUR 14 million to strengthen the communities affected by the agrarian reform in the four provinces in the centre of Mindanao. Preference will be given in this project to the Muslim and indigenous people in the region"s provinces.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance, too, with the aim of the Philippine Government, the project will be aimed at the Muslim communities, particularly the rebel repatriates who have become beneficiaries of the agrarian reform of approximately 37 communities. Its aim is to provide assistance to improve the quality of the land, to organise and strengthen farmers" associations and to supply the basic social infrastructure. It also aims to guarantee water supply, build schools and health centres, promote productivity and undertake projects with minor infrastructures. This is a summary of the European Union"s participation in the process of rural redevelopment and reform in the Mindanao region. And indeed, it is one of the key elements in the peace process that was negotiated some years ago with the Moro Liberation Front.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ford </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group on the relocation of jobs by the Xerox Corporation, first I should like to apologise on behalf of my co‐signatory, Mr Metten, who, because of the delay in this debate has had to return to Holland.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to our resolution let me be clear. Our resolution deals with the transfer of 250 jobs from Venray in Holland, and over 500 jobs from Mitcheldean in the United Kingdom, to Ireland. However this resolution is not an attack on Ireland or the Irish; nor is it an attack on the peace process. We will be voting in favour of Amendment No 6 tabled by Mrs Ahern and Mrs McKenna which points out that the creation of employment in the Dundalk region is an important support for peace and reconciliation in the border area and welcomes in principle the initiative to create jobs in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution on behalf of the Socialist Group, the Christian Democrat Group and the GUE Group deals with two major separate issues. First is the failure by the Xerox Corporation, an American‐based multinational, to adequately consult with the workforce, particularly in Mitcheldean and with local government in both locations.</p>
<p class="contents">The company claims they have followed the letter of the law, but testimony from the workforce in Mitcheldean, two of whom were seated in the gallery today, suggests that the spirit of the law suffered from gross abuse. They – the Xerox Corporation – claim they went through the presentation of a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> in slow motion. The company told me earlier this week that the consultation started on 7 April 1998 and the final decision was not made until September. Since that time, however, I have been given a copy of a photograph and a press report that shows a picture of Irish Deputy Prime Minister Mrs Mary Harney with Mr Bill Good, Deputy Managing Director of Xerox, announcing the new plant on 2 June. The period of genuine consultation was so short that the process was little short of a farce. I hope the Xerox Corporation, when this resolution is passed, will try again, try harder and try properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue we deal with is the more general concern about the possible use of European aid to shuffle jobs around Europe. We are very much in favour of job creation with a rising 20 million unemployed in the European Union, but Xerox is an example – by no means the only one, by no means the worst and, unfortunately, by no means the last – where, on closer inspection, what are claimed to be shiny new jobs being created turn out to be a mirage. They are somebody else's job, kidnapped and held to ransom and eventually sold across Europe to the highest bidder.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘somebody else's jobs" are devastating families and communities. In the Forest of Dean, an area with high unemployment, Xerox is the single largest employer. This is not an appropriate use of Community funds. This is not an appropriate use of European assistance. This is not an appropriate use of national assistance. We should all be clear about this. Ireland has suffered as much as any. Fruit of the Loom recently moved on to richer pastures. We should all learn from each other that getting engaged in this kind of Dutch auction is not the way forward in terms of job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke to Xerox this week. They have moved a little. They have at least now agreed to consider applications for job transfer from individuals with appropriate qualifications, which is why we have to reject Amendment No 5 by Mr Dupuis, on behalf of the ARE Group which claims that Xerox is considering such requests. It is a doubtful claim when the principle was only agreed two days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Xerox is one particular example of an all too common problem. We have good cause to complain and to protest about this case in particular, but we also have a responsibility to use Parliamentary power to change the rules to protect tomorrow's victims as well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ahern </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Madam President, it is always a cause for deep concern when people lose their jobs and it is perfectly proper and natural to raise matters regarding consultation and compliance with EU regulations. However, to target the creation of jobs for others, particularly in a region like Dundalk, which needs economic stability to copperfasten the process of peace and reconciliation, is unacceptable. Therefore I very much welcome Mr Ford's comments, and the fact that he agrees with my amendment – which states the principle of the creation of jobs in that area – is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Relocation concerns the movement of industrial facilities from one Member State to another and is of concern to the EU in so far as state aid or Structural Funds are, or seem to be, fuelling and encouraging such relocation. Many factors, however, can contribute to a commercial decision to relocate a plant. In this context, it is a matter of constant criticism in Ireland that members of government, in particular prime ministers and deputy prime ministers, rush to announce decisions before they are properly constituted. I would criticise Mrs Harney for so doing, if, as was said, she did that at a time in the process when consultations should have been taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in Ireland we refuse to be cast in the role of villain because of one or two high‐profile relocations in recent years. We have also been the losers of important projects and significant job numbers. Structural funds are not a factor in these packages, and the policy that state aid should be recouped if an enterprise relocates has been the consistent policy and practice of the Industrial Development Authority in Ireland. This is simply a matter of best practice in industrial policy and the correct management of public finances.</p>

We have no such criticisms. We also do not wish to criticise the way the Irish authorities have tried to make sure they secured this Xerox plant in order to bring jobs to the area. What we do criticise is that European funding has been able to be used to relocate the electronics division from the Venray plant to a new location in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Xerox claims that this is not a relocation, but some staff and part of the company are being moved. What we want to know is why the Commission agreed that this multinational, which as we know wants to downsize worldwide, should be allowed, either by being provided with a suitable site or with subsidies, to transfer part of its staff to its plant in Ireland. How can European Union funding, in other words taxpayers" money, be used to create such a distortion of competition?</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, most of the investment in Ireland is in entirely new projects and does not involve the relocation of jobs. The incentives given to Xerox in Ireland comply fully with EU competition policy. No European money whatsoever has been involved in the project. So there is a serious mistake there.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK gets 40 % of all foreign investment which comes into the European Union. Are we to have a Commission inquiry into this, with allegations that because it gets 40 % of all investment there is something wrong? Recently we have seen headlines in Dutch and Irish newspapers about jet aircraft being chartered to fly workers from the west of Ireland to jobs in the Netherlands because the Netherlands cannot get workers to do this work. Yet we cannot get enough workers for our own labour‐intensive industries in Ireland. Are we going to ask the Commission to investigate that? Please do not be jealous of Ireland because we have had economic growth for the last year or two. Ireland represents 1 % of the European Union, 1 % of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The 8 000 net jobs which we gained last year, our best year ever, will not solve the problem in Holland or the UK. Please, MEPs, do not try to tell your constituents that it is the economic boom in Ireland that is taking jobs out of your constituencies. That is a total distortion of the truth and an abuse of the urgency procedure in this Parliament.</p>

Should it not be adopted, I am even more opposed to the thrust and the tenor of the Socialist and Green resolutions, nor can I support the EPP resolution. Structural Funds are not a factor in these type of packages. Our state aid to industry is reasonable and permissible and has been approved by the Commission. It is declining in response to our increased development, public expenditure reductions and new European Union rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of relocation has been discussed in the Industry Council and Commissioner van Miert believes that the existing rules are more than adequate to prevent abuse of state aids and that no further action can be called for by the Commission. I am proud of our record in securing inward investment. Many factors can contribute to relocation decisions. In Ireland we now have a talented and well‐educated workforce and a good skills base, and the aid profile of the workforce in Dundalk is right. We have the language skills and the necessary flexibility, productivity and labour costs. Our wise investment in telecommunications has enabled us to benefit from one of the most advanced networks in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out to the British proponents of the original urgency motion that their own Labour Government was the most vociferous when the German Government recently mooted the introduction of a harmonised tax system in the European Union. How can you call in effect for a realignment of taxes in the Member States while such a move is opposed by your own government? The Irish Government has reached an agreement with the European Commission with regard to regulating our corporation tax regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally I welcome the Xerox decision to relocate in Ireland and I would urge it to do its utmost to avoid the need for any redundancies.</p>

Certain colleagues in this House have constantly broadened the scope of our urgency procedure. We have discussed doping, and today we are faced with an even more serious matter, the individual case of a company. Imagine how many company cases could be brought before this House and would convert it, as it is now, into a Parliament for unions and bosses in which no‐one has the documentation and no‐one can judge by the evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, there are a number of inaccuracies, and a number of things that are frankly false. Moreover, we are talking about relocation. My colleagues should know that, in a single market, it is no longer a question of relocation, but of a choice on the part of companies who have every right to go wherever they please, wherever they feel offers the best conditions for them to produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as we can do no more than limit the damage, I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Radical Alliance in order to try to set the record straight and not to punish an American company that has done some restructuring in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, and which, in addition, has created 1 000 jobs in another country of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, and we must, congratulate them. This is why I invite our colleagues to vote in favour of the amendments from the ARE Group and I welcome the fact that there are still Americans who have confidence, who come to invest in our countries and who carry out restructuring when it is necessary.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Vanhecke </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, the resolution before us on the relocation of a major company from one Member State to another brings us face to face with a familiar but fundamental problem. What it boils down to is that huge amounts of money from the Structural and Cohesion Funds can be used directly or indirectly not really to create new jobs, but to attract firms and jobs from other Member States. To put it bluntly but accurately, it is a sort of organised theft of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I do not know enough about the case in question to be able to judge, and I actually think that Ireland in particular has made a huge effort over the last few years to use the European funds intelligently and efficiently, which unfortunately cannot be said of all the other Member States or regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, however, the problems of how the European funds are used remain enormous. There are problems of waste and fraud – as I am sure the Commission will agree – there are problems with the improper allocation of funds, and there are problems with jobs being relocated rather than created.</p>
<p class="contents">My province of West Flanders too has similar problems, with the neighbouring province in Wallonia luring firms with the 30 billion francs of Structural Fund money that it has at its disposal. The Commission knows about this and acknowledges that it is a problem, but up to now it has done nothing about it. If it is not tackled at its roots, I fear that the time will soon come when the people of Europe will no longer be prepared to show solidarity, and this would be a great pity. If we want to prevent this, then it is high time we did something about it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Banotti </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Madam President, most of what has to be said about this issue has been said. But I would just like to return to the fact that many colleagues are under the misconception that European funds have been used in an unethical way to attract the Xerox Corporation to Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what has attracted Xerox and many other high‐tech companies to Ireland has been the decision on the part of successive Irish Governments to target education for young people and to prepare them for these high‐tech jobs, which has resulted in Ireland becoming an attractive place for the location of such companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that I fully understand the anguish, particularly in the UK, of the workforce who perceive this as an attack on their jobs. I accept their point that they were not given adequate consultation and if there was any, it was a very superficial kind of consultation, which in fact went against the works directive that this Parliament has supported.</p>
<p class="contents">That having been said, I welcome the jobs that are coming to Dundalk, a sad black spot that is desperately in need of better development and more jobs. I hope that we can resolve this in a way that is acceptable to all of us. Obviously there is not a strong difference of opinion between us here.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Madam President, I would like to begin by saying, on behalf of the Commission, that I fully understand the problems of regions that lose jobs to other parts of the Community. Fortunately, such cases are still relatively rare within the European Union and, of course, as you just pointed out, the new jobs created in regions that attract investment are welcome, since this means an increase in employment. However, these positive elements do not mean that we can ignore the distressing consequences involved for the regions where the jobs are lost. Therefore, it is a very difficult balance to strike.</p>
<p class="contents">The social repercussions of relocations can be worse if workers or their representatives are not adequately consulted beforehand. In order to alleviate the negative social effects often caused by industrial restructuring, the European Union established various legal instruments designed to guarantee that this type of operation takes place in an acceptable social climate and that due consideration is given to the interests of those who may be affected. In this respect, the Commission"s services are currently trying to establish whether or not Xerox has complied with national and Community regulations on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">When considering relocations, we must not exaggerate the importance of subsidies in the decisions taken by companies. Such subsidies may influence the choice of the new site, but they do not necessarily influence the decision to close or reduce the capacity of existing plants. However, this issue was discussed at the last two Industry Councils and on both occasions the Commission explained the measures that have been taken to reduce the incentives that Member States can offer to companies to make them move from one area to another. I will give you a brief summary of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the new guidelines from December 1997, the Commission has reduced the levels of regional aid that Member States may grant. These guidelines will enter into force at the end of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the recent multi‐sectoral guidelines on regional subsidies to large investment projects may reduce even further the levels of subsidies for large projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a durability clause has been added to the guidelines on regional subsidies and to the Structural Fund regulations, stating that investment projects that have received subsidies must last at least five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Commission has also adopted a new communication on fiscal aid that explains how the rules on state aid are applied to tax incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, and this aspect is especially important in this case, the Commission has taken measures to eliminate the element of state aid involved in Irish corporation tax.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific question of Community funding, Parliament should note that since 1 January 1998 the European Regional Development Fund has not provided any subsidies for local investment in Ireland. There has thus been no intervention on the part of the European Regional Development Fund in Ireland since 1998. This decision was taken in order to rationalise Community aid to the Irish production sector, but also because it was believed that this area should no longer receive Community aid precisely because of the high performance of the Irish economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, no subsidies for the new Xerox plant in Dundalk have been cofinanced by the ERDF, nor has it received any subsidies from the European Social Fund.</p>
