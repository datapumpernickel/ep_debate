<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for this report on the extension for one year of the fisheries protocol to the agreement between the Community and Côte d'Ivoire. I am happy to note that you support the spirit of this proposal, since the Commission – for political and social reasons – has had to proceed with an extension instead of a renewal of the protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, due to the difficult political situation in the autumn 2002 and spring 2003, it was not possible to proceed with negotiations. The protocol is important for the EU fishing industry, which fishes and uses the port of Abidjan to land their catches from the whole region and not only from Ivorian waters. This, in turn, is an advantage for Côte d'Ivoire. The protocol also supports scientific research, which is essential for ensuring the sustainability of the fisheries and for building up capacity to administer this in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the previous protocol, European businesses have made investments in Côte d'Ivoire. There are now three tuna canneries in the port of Abidjan which process tuna for the European market. They generate over 30 000 local jobs. The one-year extension of the protocol provides fishing possibilities for 71 tuna vessels and some demersal fishing as well. The targeted measures remain the same and represent 71% of the financial contribution out of an overall contribution that is also kept at the previous level – EUR 957 500.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the good level of utilisation of the tuna fisheries on the one hand, and the ministry's use of targeted measures to ensure sustainable fisheries, the Commission considers the extension to be good value for money. This is true for both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, one cannot be fully satisfied with the fact that this extension, which has been in operation since 1 July 2003, was only presented to this Parliament on 23 September. One reason for this delay was that the letter of extension was signed by Ivorian Fisheries Minister only on 16 May 2003. However, I would add, in all honesty and fairness, that these delays are never the result of one of the partners alone. I express my regret for the delay. If I were a Member of this House I would look at this with some scepticism.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am happy to know that on 24 November you received an evaluation report on the implementation of the protocol, which answers some of your requests for future negotiations on the renewal of the protocol. The report submitted is a study assessing the fish stocks and the application of the protocol up to August 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendments Nos 1 and 2, the Commission fully shares the concern to keep Parliament informed on various aspects of the implementation of the protocol. However, the Commission already forwards this kind of information, in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements and, in particular, with the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament of 5 July 2000. Therefore, the Commission considers that these two amendments are not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment No 3, the agreement, according to Article 13 thereof, shall be renewable for additional periods of 3 years, unless notice of termination is given in writing by either of the parties. However, the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution is only valid for three years and will have to be renewed after that period. If the amendment refers to the renewal of the protocol and not of the agreement as such, the amendment goes against the principles regarding the nature of the protocols to the fisheries agreements. Since the protocols are annexed to the framework agreements, their periodical renewal does not require any new directive for negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment No 4, considering the importance of the fisheries agreement for Côte d'Ivoire – in terms of the 30 000 jobs generated by EU canneries in Abidjan, and the fact that the financial contribution goes mainly to scientific research, control and surveillance – not extending the agreement would be a disaster for the country. It would also be a serious problem for EU fishermen and the investments made in Côte d'Ivoire. Failing to extend the agreement would mean isolating Côte d'Ivoire. This is not the sign the EU wants to give to a country which is struggling to find a way back to peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the great pleasures of chairing the Committee on Fisheries is having to come here late at night to address an empty chamber on international fisheries agreements with far flung corners of the globe. This is no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this evening's debate on Côte d'Ivoire has been provoked, not on the usual matters relating to third-country fisheries agreements, but by the Verts/ALE and ELDR groups, who have expressed quite legitimate concerns over the current civil war in that country, and their fears that Community funding should not be sent to a zone of conflict lest it pour petrol on the flames.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, the main rebel army in Côte d'Ivoire, who call themselves the New Forces, signed a French-brokered peace deal with Prime Minister Seydou Diarra last January. Sadly, this peace pact partially crumbled in September when the New Forces walked out of the government, accusing President Laurent Gbagbo of hoarding power and refusing to implement the conditions of the peace pact. Meanwhile, President Gbagbo has announced his intention to liberate rebel-held zones in the North and West of the country should the New Forces refuse to disarm. That is the position of Côte d'Ivoire today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this rather unfavourable background that my report on the Commission's proposal seeks to extend the current fisheries agreement between the Community and Côte d'Ivoire for a further year, although the period actually commenced last July – as Commissioner Nielson pointed out – before the Parliament had even been consulted. The Commissioner said that Members of Parliament would find that this was disagreeable, and that is indeed the case. Being bounced into these <span class="italic">faits accomplis </span>again and again by the Commission is extremely disagreeable. Indeed in this case, payment to Côte d'Ivoire is due on 31 December 2003. So there is therefore a considerable need for urgency in settling this matter. It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee was forced into this position once again. I trust, however, the Commission appreciates the efforts we have made to accelerate the process in order that this contract can be honoured in time.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement will be the sixth successive protocol between the EU and Ivory Coast. We first entered into a fisheries partnership with them in 1990 and have continued on an amicable basis ever since. However, inevitably – as Commissioner Nielson said – the political instability in the region resulted in our inability to take up some of the demersal fishing opportunities which we had negotiated in 2002. However, as the situation stabilised, it was possible for this fishery to resume again.</p>
<p class="contents">Tuna fishing, which is the other major resource covered by this agreement, was never affected by the civil war and, in terms of the uptake of opportunities negotiated under the agreement, we have continued at a level of around 85%. As Commissioner Nielson pointed out, there are 71 licences available for tuna vessels, although as always in these partnership agreements, over 70% of the financial compensation goes to targeted actions ensuring the continuation of a sustainable fishery and underpinning conservation measures, scientific research and control and surveillance. These funds are closely monitored by the Commission to ensure compliance with the objectives of the protocol. In the absence of this agreement, we could not guarantee that a sustainable fishery would continue. Indeed we could see a complete free-for-all with IUU fishing causing the complete plunder of the stocks and the collapse of the fishery.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for those who oppose the renewal of this contract to understand the implications of their opposition. Commissioner Nielson highlighted that there are three large tuna canneries in Abidjan, funded by EU investment. Indeed, Abidjan is the focus for much of the tuna landings in West Africa and if, as the Verts/ALE and ELDR Groups suggest, we pull out of this agreement, 5000 direct jobs – and up to 30 000 indirect jobs – would disappear. Such an outcome would have catastrophic consequences for the social situation in Côte d'Ivoire and would seriously destabilise the country, plunging it into further conflict. So, I appeal to the Verts/ALE and ELDR Groups to think again and withdraw their amendments which would only make a bad situation worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to concur with what the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has said, also in relation to the very difficult issue that is being discussed there. If you consider the situation in those coastal strips with much domestic unrest and wars, it remains to be seen to what extent we, once the situation has improved, can also employ fisheries policy to improve the situation in the country itself. Provided the money we invest in the fisheries agreements is well spent, Europe could play a greater role on that score too.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am disappointed about the amendments on this subject tabled by the Liberal Group. I would have preferred to see more of a social component in them, and I back anything that can improve the situation in the African countries in relation to fisheries agreements. However, it is essential for all aspects to be discussed in depth. Once again, though, I wish to concur with the words of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. I have also noticed that these are widely supported, and I would ask the Commission on the one hand, for an all-out effort for the African countries, including a wise spending plan of the money from the fisheries agreements, but on the other, we consider it essential for the social components also to be taken into consideration. I am therefore looking forward to the Commission’s reaction, as well as Parliament’s. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this resolution the European Parliament calls on all the conflicting parties to scrupulously apply the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a responsibility in terms of preventing conflicts, and its various policies aimed at promoting commercial relations between Europe and developing countries represent a form of preventing this type of conflict. Commercial and human relations bring peoples closer together, contribute to their development and the development of their different economic sectors. My group therefore supports the fisheries agreement, because commercial agreements and relations between peoples promote peace and, in the case of fisheries agreements, also the development of the fisheries sector in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support this report by Mr Stevenson in favour of a one-year extension of the current protocol, with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Ivory Coast is a country at civil war which we must help so that it can achieve peace and economic progress. We Socialists therefore believe that the message we are sending through the extension of this fisheries agreement is a positive one.</p>
<p class="contents">The war is not a reason to put an end to a fisheries agreement. If we did that it would be absurd and would increase the suffering of that country, and the same thinking would lead us to suspend imports of its products, such as coffee, cocoa or palm oil and, also, to suspend emerging oil operations and not to buy any more of its diamonds, its manganese, its iron, its cobalt, bauxite or copper.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is there this insistence on putting an end to commercial fisheries agreements which bring the European Union closer to the developing countries and then to promote exports from those countries of agricultural products, for example, and also minerals, oil or gas? Despite the war, the execution of the quotas allocated by the agreement, as in the case of tuna, has been good, and the level of catches of demersal species is improving.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group believe that this agreement is of great benefit to the port of Abidjan, which is the largest tuna-fishing base in West Africa, where catches are the raw material for a large local processing industry which is a key element in Ivory Coast’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a good agreement illustrating how, in the case of a country which is faced with serious difficulties, fisheries agreements can operate well for both parties, the European Union and the developing country which is signing it with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission came to the Committee on Fisheries and said 'We have no way of negotiating a new agreement so we shall just extend it for another year'. Members indicated that the aim of this was to allow EU vessels to continue fishing despite the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">You are now actually trying to give the impression that this is somehow about helping the people in Côte d'Ivoire: the reality is that this is about helping ourselves. This is a country that is virtually in a state of civil war. It is impossible for the government to guarantee control and surveillance – in fact these were never satisfactory, even during peace time.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens now is that the EU fleets can do what they like with no supervision whatsoever. The Commission actually promised a different approach to third-country agreements and this does not bode well. With respect to Côte d'Ivoire, the Commission has itself noted that the country faces serious problems in the control and surveillance of its waters. The state of monitoring is described as a major constraint.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also noted that no information was actually received on the catches of surface long-liners and freeze trawlers. The Commission has also stated that, under the current terms of its third-country agreements, including the one with Côte d'Ivoire, it is impossible to know whether the money intended for the so-called targeted actions such as control and enforcement is, in fact, spent in the appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We have said that this money should be placed in a separate budget. When it comes to the tuna canneries, look at where the main profits are going: there is complete hypocrisy here. This is a country in a state of conflict and it looks like the EU's approach is to allow our fleets to continue undisturbed, despite the fact that there is a conflict going on.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the worst example ever of a fisheries agreement, and the Commission has to live up to its commitments and its promise to take a different approach to fisheries agreements where that is in the interest of the third country rather than in the interest of the European Union's over-capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, unfortunately, that there are many worse agreements than this one. We are in the process of renewing and modernising these agreements, making them more relevant and increasing the focus on social development. The old generation of these agreements, however, really deserves a black mark, and it is thus extremely important to change this situation. This is happening on a country-by-country basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The current conflict in Côte d'Ivoire is not a very good background for stopping this agreement. We should be wary of politicising the matter by using the agreement to put pressure on the Government to achieve peace and reconciliation. It is very difficult to pressurise the opposition in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards surveillance and the management of maritime resources, this conflict has not really taken place at sea, so I find it rather artificial to link the problems in the country with the continuation of this agreement. We are trying to do useful things in Côte d'Ivoire, and at the same time we are putting pressure on all sides to arrive at a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">If we start politicising this activity we will be sending the wrong signals to those involved. I would thus urge Parliament to stop this. Mrs McKenna made some very relevant points, however. There is a process under way to increase the focus on development in these fisheries agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
