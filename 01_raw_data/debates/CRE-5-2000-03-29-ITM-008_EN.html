<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the political groups in this House who have supported the report of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and who have enriched it through their participation in the intense debates which we have held. Furthermore, I also wish to recognise the positive and cooperative attitude of the Commission to whom, Commissioner, I would like to express my personal thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plans for the six countries selected by the High Level Working Group on asylum and migration represent, and this seems to me to be important, the first external action of the European Union in the field of immigration and asylum, and as Commissioner Vitorino correctly said in Strasbourg, they are priority objectives for the Member States and I hope they continue to be so.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, Mr President, on the one hand reflects the critical feeling of all the groups with regard to aspects of form and substance in the presentation and preparation of the plans. We have not been able to examine each one of them individually and we have had to limit ourselves to very general considerations and, on this basis, make proposals which I hope will be taken into account by the Commission and the Council for these and for future action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the very fact that these action plans are to be implemented is positive in itself. It is also positive that we have combined action plans in the fields of foreign policy, cooperation and development and in adopting measures to regulate migratory flows. However, what has not been positive is the way that the Council has presented these plans to Parliament, which has remained silent on the way in which they have been selected and drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">Our basic concern relates to the possible effectiveness of the actions planned for countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia or Iraq, where political instability is combined with constant violations of the most basic human rights. Quite different is the case of Morocco, or even Albania or Sri Lanka, where there is a greater likelihood of multi-sectoral cooperation, and there are countries with privileged situations such as Morocco, where we have just implemented an association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the fact that it is impossible to comply with the time limit laid down for the majority of actions, there is also a lack of budgetary contribution for some of the measures envisaged, as more than 50% of them have no financial resources. That is why one of our proposals is to create a budget line for 2001 to cover these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the imbalance between the measures to control migratory flows and those which promote genuine cooperation in the development of the countries selected, including measures for integration. We cannot criminalise immigration, whether it is for economic or political reasons. It should be understood that it is crucial to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Summit on the ‘communitisation’ of asylum policy and the fair and humanitarian treatment of refugees and immigrants. We should put emphasis on the humanitarian conditions in reception centres and also take advantage of the experience of some countries with regard to regional approximation.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as economic immigration and cooperation with countries of origin, we should deal with the question of labour market legislation in the Member States themselves, the social integration of immigrants and the fight against the mafia-types involved in the trafficking in human beings. The problem cannot be resolved solely by means of readmission and border control agreements, although they are necessary. In terms of the action plans, these measures seem to be given priority over the ones I have just mentioned</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it necessary to create an immigration monitoring centre because, in addition to coordinating statistical data, this would allow sociological studies to be carried out on the phenomenon of migration, which would help in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to respect for human rights, there must be greater cooperation in order to modernise the administrative structures of some of the selected countries. We must also cooperate in the training of police forces and, in particular, open them up to cooperation with the NGOs, which have a social role to play in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I hope that, with regard to these plans and the plans to come, the defects highlighted in this resolution will be corrected and that there will be closer cooperation, especially on the part of the High Level Working Group and the Council, with Parliament. I also hope, of course, that the Commission will be given the resources to carry them out. The success or failure of the European Union’s first external action in an area as sensitive for European society as immigration and asylum, depends on the success of these plans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has already emphasised, and rightly so, that although migration and asylum are closely related issues, they are nevertheless substantially different and require different responses from the European Union, although it should be borne in mind and recognised that in both cases there are advantages in applying a cross-pillar and global approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that increasing numbers of people are seeking better opportunities or protection through migration, in order to escape war, persecution, poverty, unemployment or violations of their human rights. We know that there is an increase in illegal migratory movement, for the most part controlled by criminal networks that often create situations involving exploitation and blatant violation of human rights. We obviously support a global approach including support for democratisation and promotion of the rule of law, support for the prevention of conflicts and for reconciliation, respect for human rights and the development within countries and regions of origin and of transit of the fight against poverty, by improving living conditions and by creating greater opportunities for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve all of this, and despite the criticisms that Mr Hernández Mollar has just presented to the House, which related specifically to action by Parliament and the effectiveness of this action in some of these countries, Parliament’s commitment must be serious and consistent. We cannot herald good intentions and then fail to put them into practice because of a lack of funding. Information campaigns must be undertaken in close cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit, publicising the real opportunities for legal emigration, in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the problem at its source.</p>
<p class="contents">We must step up the fight against illegal immigration, ensure that the rights of the victims of criminal networks are protected, and step up efforts to prevent all forms of trafficking in human beings, paying particular attention to the situation of women’s and children’s rights. We must also detect and break up the criminal networks involved in these activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Union, we must make a detailed assessment of the situation in the various Member States and harmonise national legislation on conditions of entry and residency. In doing this, we must take into account economic and demographic changes in the Union, each Member State’s ability to receive immigrants and the historical and cultural ties that the Member State may have with the countries of origin. In short, we agree with a common European policy on asylum and immigration based on four pillars: partnership with the countries of origin, a common European asylum system, fair treatment of immigrants from third countries and more efficient management of migratory flows.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Terrón i Cusí (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like firstly to express, on behalf of my group, our unease at this Council proposal at a time when, within the Union, we are working – and this is shown in the initiatives which the Commission has taken and is taking – on the communitisation of what we have called the ‘Third Pillar’ and on the development of an immigration and reception policy for citizens from third countries. We are uneasy because we do not understand very well where this High Level Working Group comes from or why it is being maintained, why the Council is making a proposal in this way and why that proposal was taken up at Tampere; what the Commission is going to do in these action plans and what coherence there is between this proposal and the work carried out by the Council’s High Level Working Group and the rest of the Commission proposals on policies to be implemented in the Union. I believe this is important and I would like an answer from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that we have mixed feelings with regard to these action plans. On the one hand, what they say seems reasonable; it seems reasonable to establish bilateral policies between the European Union and some of the countries in which the problem of the exodus of migrants and refugees is greatest; this seems useful. This is the case with Morocco, for example, with whom we must establish a serious and significant bilateral relationship in order to ensure that the immigration originating from that country remains within the law. This may also be the case with the Balkan countries, where it is clear who our partners are.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, there are countries on this list whose governments do not even deserve to be described as such, and countries with which I do not think we should speak, such as Afghanistan. I would like to ask the Council if it intends to go to Afghanistan and say, ‘Good afternoon. We have come to tell you to respect human rights because you are sending us too many refugees.’ This would be absolutely incredible or, at least, very naive.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it seems to me that broaching this issue with these countries is difficult and dangerous. I believe that there are some people that we should not even speak to on principle. Therefore, since we cannot adopt a cross-pillar approach – that is to say, between the Third and the First Pillar – taking the shortest route, I believe that the Council should once again consult this Parliament on each and every action plan which is to be set up, in accordance with the provisions of the First Pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">I have pointed out two problems: who is going to take charge of these action plans and with whom?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third problem: how are we going to pay for them? There is no budgetary contribution set aside for them and the measures which provide for some degree of funding will apparently take money, for example, from cooperation programmes such as MEDA. It is difficult to see how the idea of codevelopment and the idea of working with these countries in order to tackle immigration at source can be compatible with the idea of taking away funds earmarked for cooperation in development, in order to guard external borders. I believe this warrants some reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the development of action plans is on the ‘scoreboard’. This is a good thing, but I would like to remind you that there is an action plan that has been implemented, that of Iraq, on which nobody has ever provided us with any information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like too to pay tribute to the work that the Commission has done in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We face a number of challenges in a world where the drive for emigration and the drive for immigration into Europe is still substantial. Clearly, we face a situation where there are push factors in countries of origin and pull factors in our own countries. It is important that we approach this debate with a very clear distinction between asylum and illegal immigration. It is important that we retain the commitment set out in the Geneva Convention and a humane approach.</p>
<p class="contents">If I would pass one message to the governments of the Member States, it is that all too often they fall into the temptation to seek easy headlines by taking the populist approach to the so-called problems of asylum seekers and illegal immigration. Too rarely do they look to the principles to which they have signed up and try to deal with this problem seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">This report sets out a number of proposals for action which are, in my view, to be welcomed. In particular it looks at immigration and at the inadequacy of current data. It looks at the problems of the action plans that have been drawn up which fail to strike the right balance between security and immigration. It looks at the policing of illegal immigration and calls for focus on combating trafficking and combating illegal employment. These are the things our Member States should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">And, of course, most importantly, it looks at budgets and the fact that under half of the measures proposed have budgetary allocations so that if we are to be serious about this, then an approach will be needed by the Council to give a legal base to the budgets which are being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">So in conclusion, Mr President, and on behalf of the Liberal Group, I welcome this report which we will vote on tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you read the action plans carefully, you will see that most space is devoted to measures to combat illegal immigration. This is not the only problem, however. No consideration is given to development policy or foreign policy measures to deal with the reasons which make people flee and emigrate from these regions. Although the High Level Working Group itself has concluded that human rights violations are an important reason why people flee, too little account of this is taken in the action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the situation in Iraq. Clearly it is not easy at present to make suitable proposals for Iraq which might have some chance of being implemented, given the current political situation. The same applies in Afghanistan, where one is uncertain as to whom one should even start discussions with. Whom should we urge to respect human rights? The way in which the High Level Working Group was set up and operates also gives cause for criticism. The European Parliament was consulted on neither the appointments to the group nor the crisis regions selected. This <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hernández Mollar’s report is highly critical of the work of the High Level Working Group. The report now gives us the opportunity to develop a new basis on which to evaluate the work of the High Level Working Group and my group therefore supports the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, contrary to popular belief, the right to immigrate does not exist. It is not enshrined in any agreement or any international convention, and it is therefore completely legitimate to regulate and restrict immigration. Moreover, when Europeans emigrated to the United States or to South America, they had to abide by quotas and obtain licences as well. My grandfather was an immigrant, and I know that at that time there were rules and, in the same way, when I emigrated to Africa for a brief period of time, I had to obtain a visa and I was subject to controls. Even recently, when I went to the ACP-European Parliament Assembly, we had to obtain visas and be vaccinated. </p>
<p class="contents">These rules are therefore fundamental, and to advocate their creation and observance can in no way be equated to racism or xenophobia. The rules must take into account the implications of admitting immigrants and, therefore, the number of people to whom it is possible to grant entry to the European Union. Borders must be watertight, and we must dispel the illusion or, in some cases, the certainty, brought about by countless amnesties, that the important thing is to get into the European Union, maybe into a State such as Italy, which is considerably more lenient than others, and that once an immigrant is in all he has to do is sit tight, avoiding committing too many crimes, if possible, and sooner or later he will receive an amnesty. This is totally unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why does the European Union need a common asylum policy? No one would deny that this is an area where countries can gain from mutual collaboration but, of course, there is nothing new about cooperation among our home countries in the asylum field. Since long before the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the Member States of the Union have been bound together by a complex web of agreements covering the right of asylum, the treatment of refugees, the principle of <span class="italic">non-refoulement </span>and much else.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not make the mistake, as we so often seem to do in this House, of believing that the only alternative to EU action is some kind of anarchy wherein no nation consults with any other. On the contrary, the alternative to action at EU level is a negotiation of bilateral and multilateral accords among independent nations. Such accords have two potential advantages it seems to me over Community action. First, they are often well tried and well trusted and established and second, they can, of course, apply to states outside of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own constituency of South-east England the local police and immigration services long enjoyed excellent relations with their French and Belgian counterparts. Indeed, it is at least arguable that we cooperated more closely with other Member States ten years ago than we do today following the entry into force of the Dublin Convention and its flanking accords.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, how can this possibly be? Well, it was Aristotle who first adumbrated the principle that which no one owns no one will look after. His precept surely holds true among nations as it does among individuals. Put bluntly, a border guard who sees that a traveller is heading for a destination beyond his own frontiers may have little incentive to detain him and so to provoke an asylum application within his own jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees, 93 000 people applied for sanctuary in the United Kingdom last year. This makes Britain the most common destination for asylum claimants in Europe, a position we hold jointly with Germany. But what is most astonishing is that this figure has risen in the United Kingdom by some 40% since the mid-1990s while across the European Union as a whole, it has remained relatively stable. I say ‘astonishing’ because the vast number of applicants in my constituency have passed through several safe countries prior to their arrival there.</p>
<p class="contents">Now surely a genuine refugee’s priority is to get out of the particular country, not to get into one. Barring exceptional circumstances it is not unreasonable to expect that someone escaping from oppression would apply for sanctuary as soon as he reached a safe state.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud of Britain’s role through the centuries as a safe haven for those fleeing from injustice and wrong and I know that Members across this House will feel a similar pride in the honourable record of their countries. That record depends on our ability to distinguish between economic migrants and genuine refugees and it depends critically on our having the resolve to secure our borders against false claimants. As cooperating states we can do this, as a single territory the evidence suggests that we cannot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, there is the question of partnership, particularly the place given to NGOs. Their opinion has not been sought or has not been taken into consideration. Another error is that questions relating to asylum and those relating to emigration have been dealt with in the same way. It is true that one cannot attack the causes of migratory flows without talking about human rights. I am going to talk about asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">With some countries Europe is signing agreements which include readmission clauses authorising the deportation of third country nationals without the political, economic and social situation of the individual or the country being taken into account. This clause is a violation of international law. It refutes the principle of not expelling people before considering whether they are being sent back to a safe country. Just how is it possible to believe that people sent back to certain countries will be safely welcomed there when human rights, particularly those of women, are violated on a daily basis in those countries? Just how can we agree to making development aid conditional upon the signature of such agreements?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must cease to turn a blind eye. The best solution to reduce the flow of migration is to support development in these countries and support the welfare of these peoples. This means cancelling the debt of developing countries. Cancelling the debt would make it possible to develop educational, social and medical structures, which would directly benefit the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it would be better to improve the host structures for refugees and asylum seekers, who are currently treated as if they were criminals wishing to take advantage of the system. They must be adequately looked after, and, in particular, given access to medical care, social entitlements, and education for children.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, would it not be more urgent to harmonise our asylum and migration policies and to establish a genuine Community policy on the subject? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will speak only about Sri Lanka, a country I have visited, and a country many of whose citizens have sought refuge in London and other parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a country, President, in which a civil war has raged for the past eighteen years – eighteen years which have seen the proportion of defence spending by the Sri Lankan government rise steadily. This money is spent fighting a war that the Sri Lankan government cannot win and it is a war that the Tamils cannot win either. The only solution must be a brokered peace. It could be that the European Union, with its historical links, could act as that intermediary.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Anna Terrón, has said that this report is naïve. I feel that the report skirts around the real issue and is a diversion from the debate that we ought to be having on Sri Lanka and the other countries. The report says that there is no end to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. It speaks of human rights abuses, cases of aid not reaching the most desperate areas and of economic deprivation. That is the effect of the war and it says that we should work more closely with the Sri Lankan government.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it is they who are controlling what we know and it is they who control what coverage we get and we must be circumspect. We all know about the well-publicised cases of Tamil action against government forces. We have heard less about the hospitals and schools being destroyed and of torture by Sri Lankan government troops.</p>
<p class="contents">So when the report says, Mr President, that we should look for ways to find a political solution to this conflict, I agree. Nothing else matters. Nothing else will solve the problems or lessen the human rights abuses. Nothing short of a cessation of the conflict will end the misery of the Tamils in Sri Lanka and nothing else will end the number of people seeking refuge in the European Union. Nothing else will stop people from fleeing the country. A high-level action plan, Mr President, that does not recognise these fundamental reports is – I would argue – not worth the paper it is written on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore all the more content to see that this report includes a reference to the key study which has just been published by the United Nations on replacement migration, as this study contains data which can only give cause for concern, revealing the current relentless advance of the process of population ageing and decline. The population of Europe will fall by 12 percent in the next 50 years if current levels of migration are maintained. Declining birth and death rates will halve the worker/pensioner ratio in the European Union from four workers per pensioner to less than 2 in the year 2050, and this will lead to a drastic reduction in pension and welfare payments to offset the sharp drop in contributions. </p>
<p class="contents">Any meaningful migration policy cannot fail to take these considerations into account, for this demographic holocaust, soon to become an economic disaster, calls for proposals for migration policies which are liberal, antiprotectionist and geared to economic requirements and labour market demand, to counteract the prohibitionist and protectionist, nationalistic, ethnic, inhumane policy currently in force in Europe. To date, this has done nothing but criminalise immigrants, who are needed by the labour market, and deliver illegal immigrants into the jaws of crime, starting with the arrangements for their entry onto European territory and ending with their involvement in the black market and other unlawful activities. </p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, while the United States are negotiating with Indian universities for the best graduates in new technologies, Europe prefers to barter with the Taliban regime with a view to repatriating some of the women once persecuted there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to join him in congratulating the rapporteur and his committee on their excellent work. </p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions can we draw from this report? Basically, that the positions of Parliament and the Council are poles apart. This has always been the case, but today we are formally recording it in a document: on the one hand, we have the Council, which maintains a particular line through the individual States of which it is composed and which makes recommendations on the basis of the decisions of those States and, on the other hand, we have the Community, or, rather, Parliament, which advocates a different, more harmonised, more coordinated and more homogeneous approach. I feel that this distinction is important: Parliament’s approach is more idealistic, optimistic and utopian, whereas the individual States are more concerned with practical issues and have to answer to their citizens, who are not easily convinced by hopes and illusions but are well aware of the reality of present conditions which, in many cases – both in Italy and in many other European countries – have resulted in uncontrolled immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in view of the security issue and the problem of migration, which has its roots in poor countries which are beset with problems, where individuals, groups and families need to find not only a means for self-expression but also a completely different, secure environment, I feel that it is essential for Community policy to be comprehensive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that it is an unreliable instrument because it does not seem that the studies on which the action plans are based provide useful new features requiring effective policy measures – usually in the form of generic proposals for classic external policy or for development aid – which would only succeed with target-country authorities that were legitimate and stable, which unfortunately is not generally the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the temptation in the action plans, in the measures that have been proposed, to place a far greater emphasis on managing illegal immigration than on integrating people. They place a far greater emphasis on repression and control than on a European asylum policy and a genuine system of temporary protection for those who come and knock at Europe’s door, for whatever reason, but always in a genuine state of need.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plans that Tampere accepted and stated should continue, in spite of their inability to cope with the complexity of the problem, could nevertheless be improved until the European Union can equip itself with an asylum and immigration policy of its own. What these plans must not do is to fluctuate between relative ineffectiveness and worsening of the situation in terms of human rights, although, as asylum seekers, immigrants cannot be considered as potential criminals. It would be better if, instead of being treated like ‘police cases’, they were treated, as a matter of course, as cases of universal exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent report. It touches on all the sore points in this saga, but it would be better if we had proposals by the Commission before us rather than reports by government experts. Let us not lose hope, however, that we will soon be debating these issues here with Commissioner Vitorino. That will be a sign that Europe has moved towards common policies based on a balance between security and integration, and that it has finally opted to put an end to uncertainty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I appreciate that Parliament can support the proposed integrated and cross-pillar approach which – and I quote the report – ‘may’ produce positive results. I understand that the Parliament is taking a cautious approach to these action plans and the Commission would like to follow the same line. On the one hand, the Commission is pleased to see that in broad terms the approach of the Council in developing these action plans is very much in line with the approach advocated by the Commission in its communication on migration of 1994 that enjoyed broad support in this Parliament. On the other hand, one must be aware that, for the time being, these plans only exist on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing these plans will need, as has already been stressed by several Members of the House, a combination of very different policies: political cooperation, human rights, rule of law and democracy, commercial, social and development policies, economic assistance need to be fitted together with measures aiming at better management of migration flowing from these countries and regions. Clearly this is not an easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to highlight, and subscribe to, a number of important elements of your draft resolution. The partnership with the third countries concerned will be always a key element for the success of such a policy with a view to promoting co-development. I would therefore support your view that we will need to initiate a political dialogue on the implementation of the action plan on an agreed basis of mutual benefit both for Member States of the Union and for the third countries. We have to recognise that this political dialogue will have to take into account the very different political situation in each of the five countries. Therefore, I would like to emphasise the important role that non-governmental organisations will have in the implementation of these action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all very well aware of the fact that migration problems will not be solved within the coming month. We have to bear in mind this very serious limitation when the European Council in December this year receives the first assessment of these action plans. I would very much agree with your observation that the European Union should adopt a long-term structural policy to tackle the causes of migration and I therefore agree that the deadlines set in the action plans are rather optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plans, however, can be considered as a first step in creating an external policy on migration of the European Union and should therefore be given a chance. I also agree with your view that reception in the region does not absolve Member States of the Union from their duties towards asylum-seekers under the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">When implementing the action plans, it is extremely important to keep the balance between the various measures so that efforts are not concentrated exclusively on the short-term defence actions. The Commission stresses that it will play an active part in maintaining that balance. Implementation will require close cooperation between the Council and its competent bodies, the Commission and Member States in accordance with their respective responsibilities as defined in the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The important role Member States have to play was, by the way, acknowledged at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of last Monday, 27 March. The presidency has called on the Member States to turn their political commitments into real activities, a request that the Commission has supported.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, of course, ready to play the active role it is expected to play, especially in areas such as development and economic assistance, human rights, good governance and institution building. In order to play a similar role for other measures, the Commission currently lacks the financial means. I therefore very much welcome your recommendation for the possibility of allocation of extra funds to cover cooperation with third countries in the fields of justice and home affairs with particular reference to immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">These budget lines should, above all, consider not only providing humanitarian assistance, including the improvement of basic living conditions, as we are already doing using the funds of ECHO, but also different initiatives aimed at economic development, improving respect for human rights, improving the independence of the judiciary, improving equal opportunities of men and women in the third countries, but also assisting the third countries to put in place the legal and practical mechanisms for dealing with asylum-seekers and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, finally I note that you consider that the action plans pay too little attention to the internal policies. However, I understand the primary aim of the action plan to be to contribute to the development of an external policy of the Union on migration. Let me assure you anyway that the Commission will take its own responsibilities in the development of a common internal European Union immigration and asylum policy as foreseen in the conclusions of Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">A detailed breakdown of our intentions is presented already in the scoreboard that was endorsed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council last Monday and which was communicated to the Parliament earlier. In autumn this year we will have a new opportunity to discuss the priorities of a comprehensive immigration policy of the Union when the Commission presents to the Council and to Parliament a review of the communication of 1994 in order to bring on board the new dynamics, the new social, political and economic realities of the world we live in as far as immigration policy is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
