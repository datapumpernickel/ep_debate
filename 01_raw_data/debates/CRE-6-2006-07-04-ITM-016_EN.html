<p class="contents">I do not want to spend a great deal of time reviewing the lengthy process whereby we worked out what we want, which involved us in two first readings and various proposals from the Commission over a period of six years. It has become clear to me that we MEPs are production line workers, and certainly many people have been working on this one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, once more, to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the good work that Mr Simpson did during the previous Parliament, and, in particular, for the constructive cooperation with all Members during this one. I am also appreciative of the good work the Commission has done as a mediator, particularly that done by Mr Salvarani – since both he and I are being kept from watching the football today, I am grateful to him for being here – and not least for the Council’s willingness to compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations have produced a respectable result and one that adds value to Europe. Following the liberalisation of the European air transport sector and the great enlargement of 2004, we have now at last succeeded in harmonising all those technical standards and administrative regulations that have a bearing on the safety of civil aviation, and now it is high time we took the continuing expansion of air travel into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The laying down of safety standards – ranging from construction to the rules on the transport of hazardous goods, by way of regulations on instruments – takes up nearly 500 pages. Until very recently, there was controversy about sections O and Q, which deal with the training of cabin crew and the working hours, in-flight hours and rest periods of pilots, and that is not surprising, since this is where the safety issues also touch upon the social benefits of the persons concerned. I do nevertheless think that we have succeeded, here too, in defining a provisional platform that, for many countries, amounts to a marked improvement in safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Before second reading, the Committee on Transport and Tourism made some important changes. Firstly, we wanted to add a safeguard clause to prevent the situation arising in which, in countries with higher standards in law or in collective wage agreements, there would be an inevitable reduction in these standards with consequences for safety and for the social benefits of the personnel on board, and we succeeded in doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it became apparent from hearings and from numerous studies that cumulative fatigue in pilots as a result of inappropriate scheduling was a problem in need of further investigation even after the result we have achieved, and the Council has proposed that this problem be put back on the agenda in three years’ time. We in this House do not think this is enough, and we have been able to secure a new scientific/medical study after only two years, relating to both sections, including Section O.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the cabin crew were, right up to the last minute, raising with us their concerns about the upgrading of their status, and I believe that our amendments do justice to that insofar as it has a bearing on safety. In negotiations with the Council, we have managed to secure an undertaking that further harmonisation and better quality training will remain under consideration and that there will be a study into these issues too.</p>
<p class="contents">I too take the view that the safeguard clause is applicable to the very varied approaches taken in Europe to certification and the issue of licences, so any loss of status in individual countries is not to be attributed to our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, when we started work on EU-OPS, no account was taken of the special situation of express freight services at night, and on that, too, we and the interested parties have arrived at a compromise that makes proper provision for their specific flight schedules while not compromising safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up by saying, once again, that a happy outcome is worth waiting for; whether it actually will be a happy one is something that will emerge from further work on the transposition of this directive. I ask all the groups in this House to give their support to this compromise that we have reached with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We owe this result above all to the excellent work of your rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, and I should like to congratulate him in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to point out the approach underpinning the proposal for a regulation. It is primarily a question of maintaining a high level of safety, while ensuring that there is fair competition among airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The amended proposal of 2004 introduced provisions concerning, on the one hand, flight times and rest periods for crews, which are currently referred to as ‘flight and duty time limitation'. It thus complies with the request of the European Parliament, which is concerned about the national disparities in this area. For a long time now, professional pilots’ associations and several airlines have been severely criticising these disparities, which are detrimental to safety and to the normal forces of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, many investigations conducted in the wake of accidents have identified crew fatigue as one of the factors contributing to these accidents. The regulations on flight times are sometimes too flexible and allow airlines to have their staff on duty for too long, to the detriment of safety and of companies subject to stricter legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The amended proposal of 2004 entails, on the other hand, cabin crew being certified on the basis of minimum requirements, as happens in the United States and as the employees concerned, together with part of the industry, were demanding. These minimum requirements should make it possible to improve air safety by increasing the quality standard with which staff must comply. They should also bring the conditions of competition for airlines in line with each other and make it easier for staff to move around within a fully liberalised air transport market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Council has had great difficulty in reaching an agreement, as a result of the Member States' very different points of view. However, the Council finally succeeded in reaching a compromise on a common position at the end of February 2006. The Council observes in its common position that the amendment tabled by Parliament has been fully taken on board, one or two slight alterations apart. The Commission does, of course, accept this position on the part of the Council, which is willing to adopt the main elements of Parliament’s proposal. On certain points, relating in particular to the flight and duty time limitations of cabin crew, we simply need to carry out a scientific and medical assessment before reaching a decision on the matter. This analysis would be entrusted to the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Council adopted its common position, our three institutions have been working intensively to reach an agreement at second reading. The common position has been clarified and improved thanks to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, and I am particularly grateful to Mr Stockmann for this text.</p>
<p class="contents">The first improvement concerns airlines whose business is based exclusively on night-time operations. The Commission, in agreement with Parliament, feels it necessary to assess the consequences in terms of safety and fatigue of the provisions concerning flight and duty time limitations and rest periods. On the basis of this assessment, the Commission will table those amendments needed to take account of these specific operating models.</p>
<p class="contents">The second improvement concerns the scientific and medical assessment of the provisions relating to flight and duty time limitations and to cabin crews. This assessment will be carried out by the European Aviation Safety Agency. I can confirm that I have already asked the European Aviation Safety Agency to include this assessment in its 2007 work programme, with a view to preparing some draft measures for submission to the Commission. On that basis, the analysis period can actually be reduced to two years, Mr Stockmann, as Parliament is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will issue a statement to shed more light on the nature of these studies, particularly in relation to the conduct and training of cabin crew in emergency situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third point is that the Commission proposal is designed to lay down minimum harmonised safety standards, at a high level and applicable throughout the Community. Nevertheless, in a number of Member States, more binding national measures may be in force. The Commission agrees that no aspect of this regulation should lead to a reduction in the highest safety standards, where these already exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall conclude. The Commission therefore has no difficulty in accepting the amendments that reflect these three principles and therefore supports the compromise amendments, that is to say Amendments 19 to 25. On the other hand, the Commission does not support Amendments 11, 16 and 17 because they overlap and because they are, in fact, covered by the compromise amendments. The same is true of Amendments 12 to 15 and Amendment 18. They concern technical amendments to various parts of the annex which are, in fact, going to be regulated by the comitology procedure provided for in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this piece of work, which is welcomed by the representatives of aviation staff, bears the hallmark of parliamentary work. I am grateful to the rapporteur and the Members of Parliament for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this time of the year, millions of Europeans are once more setting off on their holidays, and doing so by air. There has been an explosive increase in air travel over the last 20 years in Europe, and, as air travel now knows practically no national boundaries, it is an anachronism that very different regulations should apply to air safety from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of this regulation is to at least make these rules more closely approximate, and that is an aim that is, as far as I am aware, supported by all the groups in this House, so we can content ourselves with making changes in a few areas, for example to the rules that put crew on freight flights at a disadvantage, where changes really do have to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, make the mistake of adding features that deal only with social security and labour law to a technical regulation that is meant to serve the interests of safety in the air; mixing these together would make the regulation’s direction less clear and tend to weaken it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we try to interfere in collective agreements between unions and employers, which are subject to labour law; such collective agreements cannot be the subject of action on the part of the state, not even action by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not lose sight of the fact that the regulation is intended to do no more than make air travel safer, then I am sure that passengers will, in future, be able to expect comparable technical safety standards, irrespective of the airport in the European Union at which they embark on their flight. For that reason alone, this regulation is deserving of support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful for the sound work done by Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have witnessed the very difficult development of this draft regulation, firstly with the report by Mr Simpson - who is not present in this Chamber, but to whom we must pay tribute - and then with the extremely careful and shrewd work of Mr Stockmann, who has made it possible today to conclude the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament, as you said, Commissioner, can pride itself on having given this draft regulation a respectable social complexion.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, the human factor has a major part to play in the field of air safety, as it often does elsewhere. One problem remained to be solved, which might have appeared of secondary importance: the human factor certainly refers to the flight deck crew, but it also refers to the cabin crew. We had difficulty in concluding because we wanted to settle the matter at the end of this second reading and not enter into a conciliation procedure. That is why 37 of us Members from different political backgrounds – I pay tribute to Mrs de Veyrac – acted in what may be regarded as an untimely fashion and tabled a number of amendments aimed at clearly and explicitly integrating subpart O into the scientific assessment and revision work.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, thanks to Mr Stockmann’s mediation, these amendments finally convinced people that a compromise was possible and persuaded the Council to accept it without going any further.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, if the compromise amendments, as they were drafted this week, are adopted – I am thinking of Amendments 22, 25 and 19 – then, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, there is no longer any reason for us to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by 37 Members.</p>
<p class="contents">That is therefore my wish, expressed with a sense of our having fulfilled our duty and of our having, in the course of this week, made some decisive progress. I am grateful to the Commission for its openness in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it is certainly true that we have been working on it for a long time, we are now close to an agreement that can enable us to raise safety to a high standard and make competition between airlines more honest. </p>
<p class="contents">The question now arises of whether the compromise that is on the table is a good one. We all know – and a couple of us have already said so – that it is not ideal, but there are times when the best is the enemy of the good. Right now, though, we have to take what we can get, for there is indeed something to be said for the compromise that is now before us: there is no levelling-down, there are rules for the cabin crew, rules for night flights by freight carriers, and results as soon as possible from the EASA study – after two years instead of after three. </p>
<p class="contents">We now have to seize the opportunity to move forward two steps at once. First, we must now approve the compromise, and I was glad to hear Mr Savary say just now that, if the compromise is approved, we should not take matters any further. Once we have approved the compromise, we will have a European basis on which we can work, on which the Commission, moreover, can begin to work, but then for everyone rather than for the limited number of Member States that can allow themselves higher standards. That is the first step. </p>
<p class="contents">The second step will then be that, once, European rules are in place, we can improve them and work on certain aspects of them, so that – and let me repeat: not just for certain Member States who can allow themselves that sort of thing – the standard can be raised. This is the way we have to do it – in these two stages. If we miss out the first, if we fail to make the compromise, we cannot go any further. </p>
<p class="contents">I understand very well the criticism levelled by some members of specific categories of personnel and the questions that they raise, for those questions have to do with safety, but when I asked them, ‘would you rather have this than nothing?’ they answered every time: ‘No, no, we want something!' I think the rapporteur has done everything possible to move all the boundaries as far as possible. The possibility that we now have of concluding a compromise and to start out with a Europe-wide regulation constitutes an opportunity that we must seize whatever else we do. </p>
<p class="contents">If we reject the compromise, I am convinced – as are the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur – that we will be left with nothing, and that we will be even further away from the objective that we want to reach. I would, in any case, like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, and also to the Commissioner for the work he has put in. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a pity that the Council is unwilling to move further on a number of points and is holding fast to a sort of reasoning that I do not find readily comprehensible, but, if the compromise that we have hammered out is approved, there is no risk whatever of us ending up empty-handed and making the situation worse rather than better, so, thank you, Mr Savary, and thanks to all the other Members, and I think we can look forward to a good result tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council spent six years haggling over this compromise and, in doing so, evidently ignored the problems of the flying crew. The consequence of that was that pilots’ flying times and the working conditions of cabin crew were open and controversial issues for our discussions in the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do want to thank our rapporteur for the really very considerable amount of work he did to put this report on a good and sound footing. It has to be said, though, that there was no discussion in the proposal of the problems posed by shift work and the fatigue – that is, the physical and mental effects of irregular working hours – which does, of course, have effects on safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution we have come up with, according to which a proposal has to be submitted within two years from now, is a compromise, and it would have been better if it could have been agreed on at once, but we should be glad to have achieved it at all, and glad that the Council has signed up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the Commission to do something positive by taking these factors – which are without doubt indispensable – into account and producing a new proposal. While I am on the subject, let me say that I am not exactly happy with the exception made for personnel on freight flights, but I will agree to it for the sake of compromise, hoping as I do that the Commission will take a responsible approach to the analysis of working times.</p>
<p class="contents">One difficult point, of course, was the prohibition on regression, about which the Council was not willing to talk, and on which the Member States were unable to give way. It is now up to them – and they will bear responsibility for this – as to whether working conditions, where they are better than what was proposed, improve, get worse, or remain unchanged, and whether, where bad working conditions still prevail, they can at last catch up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, there are two basic factors that relate directly to the strengthening of flight safety rules: the human factor and the state – the airworthiness – of aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">Although trade union representatives have from time to time officially expressed their acute concern about the intensification of the exhausting working times of workers and about the deterioration in training provided for cabin crews being promoted in the relevant regulation, unfortunately these elements are not taken into account. It is a well-known fact that the exhausting working times of cabin crews increase flight safety risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Another basic parameter, which was the subject of a letter from qualified Olympic Airways aircraft engineers dated 8 October 2004 and the corresponding reply, which I have here, from Mr Barrot dated 18 January 2005, concerns pre-flight checks.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would draw your attention to a very serious matter. In the second paragraph of Mr Barrot's letter, in reply to the trade union representatives who are responsible for checking the airworthiness of aircraft, it says that, as far as pre-flight inspections are concerned, the analysis of the current legal situation at European Union level (law 2042/2003) confirms that pre-flight inspections do not qualify as technical inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">For goodness sake. If pre-flight inspections of aircraft are not technical inspections, then what are they? We really consider that aircraft inspections by organised engineers in accordance with Part-66 (Aircraft Maintenance Personnel Licensing) need to be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the most important matter for those present, chiefly members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, is to reach agreement after six years of work on that version of the reading that is also acceptable to the Council. To procrastinate on amendments and regulations setting technical requirements and administrative procedures in such a fast-growing business sector as aviation is, I believe, no longer permissible or forgivable. For this same reason, namely the development of the sector, we must insist on a two-year deadline for completing the evaluation of Section Q. With regard to the compromise reached with the Council on the so-called non-regression clause, I believe that it is sufficient and I do not give credence to the concerns that have been expressed regarding mistrust of some European Union Member States which might, so it is thought, reduce flight-capacity time-limit safety standards to the lowest mandatory EU standards. Finally, the Community-wide recognition of steward training programmes and the possible licensing of stewards as an additional means of increasing aviation safety will also have a very important effect, one that is often discussed in Parliament and especially by the left wing: it will allow members of this profession to compete within the Community and receive equal pay and social guarantees, regardless of whether they are from old or new Member States. I will not use the time remaining to me so as to allow the honourable rapporteur to watch his team play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these is the safety of aviation as a means of transport, and one that is in increasing use every day. More and more people are dependent on aviation in their everyday lives, but is also important for industry. Also at issue are the precise limits of human ability under difficult and dangerous conditions. To what extent is it possible to work difficult hours and still maintain a high level of safety? It is questions such as these that the European Parliament has found important and that have caused us to devote so much time to this issue. I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the truly excellent cooperation from which we have benefited and for the high-quality compromise that we have now reached. I am also amongst those who believe that we should vote in favour of the compromise, as we do need regulations at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Pilots and cabin crew are the key personnel in the air when it comes to safety. For us as passengers it is never acceptable for safety to be interfered with in order to keep prices down or in order for companies to be able to drive each other out of business. Pilots’ working conditions have been quite carefully examined in the past, and competition must not be allowed to cause a deterioration of those conditions. For this reason, the review after two years is very important. Regulations on working time must be backed up medically and scientifically within EASA by Europe’s foremost experts in the field of working time, rest, sleep and fatigue.</p>
<p class="contents">Cabin crew must also have sound knowledge and training, and this applies to all cabin crew. Their working duties have changed and become increasingly important in the wake of 9/11. We must therefore also contribute to achieving high safety levels and high levels of competence for cabin crew, and we are doing this through the compromise. As a final point, the agreements in place differ between Member States. I think it important that those Member States that have better legislation or collective agreements should not be forced to fit in with a lowest common denominator. We need non-regression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He deals with a very broad and important subject which concerns the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation. We should pay particular attention to a comprehensive approach to a question which is of significant importance to the proper functioning of air transport, and should include safety standards and healthy competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for a detailed approach is demonstrated by the document itself, which consists of around 480 pages. The procedures presented in the regulation are specific and precise. They refer to the aircraft itself, including its navigational and communications equipment and procedures for technical staff. They also apply to the flight parameters and the air crew. The legislation deals with the issue of certificates, limitations on flight time and staff duties, as well as vital rest times for staff. They also cover matters dealing with airports and regulations for the activities of air operators, including issues relating to aircraft fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the regulation deals with the question of meteorological conditions and guidelines on procedures to be followed in the event of limited visibility or other dangerous situations. There is a clear attempt to maintain where they already exist, and to introduce where they are not yet entirely compulsory, unified principles and criteria for action and implementation of the appropriate technical conditions in order to guarantee the highest possible level of air transport safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The very intensive growth of air transport which we have witnessed requires absolute compliance with procedures and maintenance of strict technical discipline. It is therefore necessary to harmonise operating regulations relating to commercial air transport. It is also important to ensure that EU regulations are respected in all Member States and that carriers and airline operators from outside the EU and which fly to EU Member States be obliged to respect them unequivocally.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some knowledge of the matter, as I hold a PhD in technical sciences specialising in aviation, and have had the opportunity to teach aviation students at Rzeszów Polytechnic, including future airline pilots. This allows me to state that the compromise solution proposed is responsible and to the point. Of course, it will also be very important to implement systematic and comprehensive monitoring of the legislation adopted. In this context I support the compromise solution achieved and call for it to be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that Mrs Sommer has produced her report, we have almost given the EU-OPS regulation one. Mr Simpson and Mr Stockmann have done a very good job, for which both of them deserve thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour law, social security and, above all, safety regulations applicable to air transport need to be properly brought up to date, but Mr Gewalt has already, and rightly, pointed out that the role of the European legislator in all these areas is a limited one. All this has taken a while, but we now have before us a good report, and one that – as many Members have confirmed – represents the best possible compromise between the airlines and the trade unions. The amendment makes full provision for the flying times, working times and rest periods of the cockpit and cabin crew and limits their maximum time on duty in the air to 13 and 11 hours respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the interested parties in the industry – the companies and the trade unions – to do the best they can with these requirements, and it is for the Commission to do more work in this area and to guarantee, by means of appropriate safety regulations, that the people currently setting off on holiday can feel safe when it is by air that they do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to pay a warm tribute to him tonight for having made such a success of it. His tenacity and flexibility have helped to achieve the great success that we all wanted to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I can still remember how, at the beginning of this debate, which I experienced with Mr Simpson in a different capacity, we were presented with a text to harmonise the technical rules and administrative procedures for civil aviation, that is to say, to move on from the JAR-OPS to the EU-OPS, and we were surprised to find that it was a text with a black hole in it: it lacked the sub-section Q, relating to restrictions on flight time and activity and to rest requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">That began one of those fascinating stories of European integration which, if at some point it is taken on by a good story-teller or film-maker, will surely help to restore our citizens' passion for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a text in a drawer in the Commission which was growing in the darkness, which was improving, but we did not really know what it contained. There was a group of European pilots and cabin staff who wanted that text to finally be adopted and there were certain airlines that did not think it was a priority, under pressure from growing competition, to operate the sector in a manner that would lead to the emergence of new competitors and that would make any proposed restrictions a serious burden, even if they were intended to improve safety. Furthermore, they had the support of their Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finding a solution seemed difficult, but we have almost found one, thanks to the passionate and joint work of everybody and to the European Parliament’s will to approve a complete text, with essential aspects for safety, aimed at people, pilots and cabin staff and with requirements on training, professional recognition and strict respect for flying and rest times, which must be regulated and harmonised in order to fully guarantee safety, without delay, in a sector which is growing exponentially and which is fully open and competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome this prior commitment tonight, which will become a first step in consolidating the European citizens' confidence in the civil aviation sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It also represents a mandate for the European Air Safety Agency to exercise responsibility, and we hope that the agency will soon apply all of this Parliament's recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can be delighted at this result for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this agreement concludes a matter that has been on the table for six years, and it is a good thing to thus be able to avoid the conciliation procedure and a further delay, even though six years is far too long for an area like air safety in which it is crucial to act quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the amendments on which the Council and the draftsmen came to an agreement take up the bulk of the requests that we made to the Committee on Transport and Tourism. That seems important to me, especially when it comes to the non-reducing clauses, which guarantee that this text will be unable to bring about a reduction in safety in the Member States in which the standards are higher than the basic standards featuring in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am particularly pleased about the provisions that deal with the issue of cabin crew. Together with Mr Savary and a number of our fellow Members, we have tabled two amendments relating to the concerns expressed by this profession. I am delighted to observe that the compromise amendments take account of these remarks and I am convinced that the regulation thus amended is a coherent and balanced text: I hope that we adopt it tomorrow by a very large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out off the record to our German and Italian fellow Members that I purposely wanted to be brief in order to enable them to follow the last few minutes of this evening's important event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are various reasons why this ‘EU-OPS’ regulation represents an important milestone in the history of air safety: the amount of air traffic in Europe is continuing its constant upward trend; European airspace is one of the most overloaded of the areas in the world through which aircraft pass; and, if the safety of air passengers is to continue to be guaranteed everywhere, then the further development of uniformly high standards of safety is a matter of urgent necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">The black list, which was published a few months ago thanks to Mrs de Veyrac, has already set high standards for airlines – mainly those from outside Europe – and similarly high standards now need to be applied to the European ones. Pilots from certain EU Member States will have the pressure taken off them as a result of the new framework conditions established by EU-OPS in respect of limits on working and rest time, and that in turn will improve passenger safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) will be producing a medical/scientific study on this, which will serve as a basis for the Commission’s proposed revisions. In my own report I will be discussing at length the EASA’s functions and areas of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this early opportunity to observe that uppermost in my mind is the safety of the passengers and of all the crew, and that I will not lose sight of that while drafting my report. Mr Stockmann has already made a considerable contribution in this respect, and has, in doing so, made civil aviation a good deal safer already. I will endeavour to play my part in ensuring that firm arrangements are made for the allocation of powers to, and coordination of, the various air safety agencies, with it being clearly indicated who shall be required to comply with the agencies’ instructions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament’s contribution has enabled us to make significant progress. It has thus enabled us to identify the areas in which work needs to be done, particularly in cooperation with the European Aviation Safety Agency. I should like to state in this connection that, in line with the compromise amendment tabled, we are going to carefully examine the specific circumstances of night flights. As regards controls, we have two levels of these: those managed by the European Aviation Safety Agency, which are designed to see whether the European rules are being applied properly by the Member States, and those managed by the Member States. We are making sure that the controls are enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that this text will be adopted by a large majority and will thus make it possible to improve air safety in Europe, to guarantee fair competition and to make it easier for staff to move around within the Community.
