<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Terrón i Cusí (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council. These have been the most important moments in the Council’s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens’ rights – and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union. It has also reached a political agreement – and we congratulate them on this – on the initial proposals for civil cooperation. This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework. They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well. Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a “scoreboard” to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also – and this seems to me to be important – at the level of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President. It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged. Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so. We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them. We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out. There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework. Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency. Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland. The same is true with regard to immigration policy. We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations. We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament. The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union. The Council can act in accordance with Parliament’s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project. If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.</p>
<p class="contents">Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way. Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future. Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be – and the Council will be – able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.</p>

<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I was one of the first Portuguese Members of this House who, in 1986, took the first steps towards the integration of Portugal into the European Union, and I have to say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, that the experience I gained here, political experience, has been extremely important in my life, and that the information we gained and the contribution that we were all able to make towards building Europe definitely marked the years that I spent here, and indeed my life.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is with some pride and satisfaction that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those days who are still in this House. The point I wish to make is that the Portuguese Presidency – to which the Minister for Justice, who is handling the field of justice and home affairs, and I myself both belong – wishes to usher in a new era with this Parliament, and to foster the relationship between the Council and Parliament. This will inevitably be influenced by my parliamentary experience in this House, and of course by the parliamentary experience of that great Member of our national Parliament who is now the Minister for Justice and my colleague.</p>
<p class="contents">We gave an early signal when, before the start of the Portuguese Presidency, we met with the President and Vice-Presidents of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in Brussels. We were able to invite the Chairman of that committee, Mr Watson, and some members of the committee to come to Lisbon, and to present our views concerning the role of the Portuguese Presidency in this area to them. And we gave an undertaking then that I now want to repeat formally: during all meetings of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, a representative of the Council, at political level, not an official but a political representative of the Council, from one of our ‘<span class="italic">cabinets</span>’, will always be involved in the work of the committee … </p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>) </p>
<p class="contents">and whenever the committee thinks fit, and the Chairman requests it, I myself or my colleague, the Minister for Justice, will come to Brussels to take part in the work of the meeting. We will accordingly give the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs the provisional agendas for the Council meetings in March and May, to allow contact to be established beforehand on the subjects to be discussed in the Council. We will do this today.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to 1999, we find ourselves in the special position of taking stock of the German and Finnish Presidencies. I would like to start by saying that, in addition to the replies that we shall be giving here to Mrs Terrón i Cusí, who has presented a proposal on behalf of her committee, we shall also be letting her have a written reply at the end of these discussions. Furthermore, I would like to say that the Council believes that 1999 was an important year in the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs was notable for the significant changes wrought by the Treaty of Amsterdam and, as a consequence, for the incorporation of Schengen into the Community framework. The German Presidency had an important task in this respect in achieving the transition from the Maastricht system to the Amsterdam system. Then there was the launching of Europol soon after the start of the Finnish Presidency, on 1 July 1999. There was also a third notable event: the Tampere Summit, a European Council devoted exclusively to justice and home affairs. The Tampere Summit was marked by a new spirit and by a determination to put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of the political agenda and to keep it there. The point that the Portuguese Presidency wishes to reiterate here is that we intend to keep issues connected with the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of the presidency’s political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our replies to Mrs Terrón i Cusí, I shall try to respond to her questions on home affairs, and my colleague will then address the points relating to justice. </p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> applies in full to ten countries, and in the course of 2000, work will be done with a view to reaching a decision on the <span class="italic">acquis</span> coming into force in Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and also in Iceland and Norway. The Secretary-General of the Council has published a collection of documents covering the entire Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, pending publication in the Official Journal once all the translations are available. This collection is, at present, available in six languages and the remaining translations are nearing completion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue I wish to raise concerns programmes in the field of immigration and asylum and how they apply to the CEECs. In March 1998, the Council adopted the Odysseus programme, a programme of training, exchanges and cooperation in the fields of policy on asylum, immigration and crossing of external borders. It applies to the fifteen Member States of the Union and provides for applicant countries, and possibly third countries also, to be associated with it. </p>
<p class="contents">This programme covers the period 1998 to 2002, and the reference amount for its implementation is EUR 12 million. Applicant countries can be associated with projects selected by the management committee as long as this complies with the objectives of the programme. The financial envelope envisaged for 2000 is EUR 3 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the 1999 programme, the Commission received 80 applications for finance, totalling EUR 7.5 million, against a budget for 1999 of EUR 3 million. The Commission proposed support for 35 projects, of which 12 were for EUR 50 000 and 23 for amounts over EUR 50 000.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the OISIN programme, and I am now referring to the 1997 budget year, projects were adopted for seminars, training, exchanges of officials, research and studies, and operational actions. Of 62 projects in all, seven included applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards SIS, the Schengen Information System, I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its operation and use. The increase in the number of positive results demonstrates the efficiency of the system and there is a continuing increase in the number of reports.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to developing a customs information system, agreement was reached with the Commission on a system which will permit provisional application of the Convention on the Customs Information System as soon as a certain number of countries have ratified this convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Terrón i Cusí also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement. I ought to comment on this final point once my colleague, the Minister for Justice, has spoken, but it is obvious that what I shall say is the result of an exchange of impressions within the Council, and in particular between the two of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I referred earlier to a new relationship with the Commission and with Parliament, with a view to achieving closer links and providing Parliament with timely information on subjects to be discussed by the Council. I would now like to state before you here that we firmly intend to consult the European Parliament, not only in those cases stipulated by the Treaty, which we are obliged to do, but also to inform and consult Parliament whenever we believe that it is appropriate to widen this type of consultation, and when, in direct contact with the Commission, we believe that Parliament should be able to present its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards information, we will communicate with Parliament on all matters which are important for establishing the area of freedom, security and justice. This partnership between the Council and Parliament, building on the Commission’s role and the excellent work Commissioner Vitorino has always done, will make it possible for the Portuguese Presidency to represent a landmark in establishing this area of freedom, security and justice.</p>

<p class="contents">As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs – an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions. We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing. I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency’s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency’s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime. With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council. If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime. Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime. As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan. However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance. We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol’s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol’s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol. The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present. For this reason, it is essential that the Council’s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also. I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">We are familiar with Parliament’s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council’s legal advisers. I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission’s view of the most important events in 1999. I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice. It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy. This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union. And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence. The Union’s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirmed at Tampere. I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">1999 was also marked by the German Presidency’s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. I believe that at the present stage in the European Union’s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens. As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour – the Commission is in favour – of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator. In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe’s common heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies. I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999. In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union. We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund. In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the “communitisation” of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice. We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering. In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency’s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council. This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also – I very much hope – represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. </p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU’s institutions respond to our citizens’ demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection. In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade – a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union’s institutions towards the public. It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice. The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as – as has already been pointed out here – specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs. I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project. And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny. For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large – in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 – and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers. I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses. Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings. I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.</p>
<p class="contents">As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime. We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters. The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also support the presidency’s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue. The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime. The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004. In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority. The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union’s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union’s position on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam. I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge. We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and – why not say it – of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the “jewel in the crown” of the Treaty of Amsterdam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Bötticher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other’s competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us. It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will. Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created. First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed. The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers. As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere. Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union. Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent. Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust. The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith. We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work. However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol’s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is “Less is sometimes more!” With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control. We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol. At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the extension to Parliament’s rights in this context. If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens. There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control. We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I have nothing further to say to the Council. The previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all! Why does the Council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom, security and justice? I find this question more and more worrying. Allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty. The police and judicial policy are quite clearly elements of sovereignty, in other words sensitive political areas in the Member States, and shifting the interface of these and communitising these policies, i.e. delegating powers from the national capitals, from Lisbon, Berlin or Paris, to Brussels represents a transfer of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is very, very difficult to break away from the executive forms which have been handed down to us, even if we recognise that police cooperation is necessary; we can only fight international crime at European level. So we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instruments available. As a result, the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need, also realise that, in implementing this, they are taking away their own powers. Then there is the European Parliament, which is also complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, however, we must find a way forward, because if we carry on as we have in the past, and with last year’s experience, then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens’ rights will be marginalised in the national parliaments as a result of making it a half national, half European structure. It has not quite taken off in the European Parliament and the Council meets behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">If the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice is kept secret, then we shall not win the citizens over to it. In other words, the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it. This is why I frequently get so worked up, but not over the Council of Ministers. Generally, they too are elected Members of Parliament: Mr Gomes, Mr Costa, Commissioner Vitorino, in principle we are all in the same boat. However, I should like to make an appeal to the Council apparatchiks. The following principle applies: He who prepares decisions, in this case the Council apparatchiks, anticipates the decisions, which is why the Council apparatchiks should demonstrate more democratic spirit.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to mention another aspect briefly because I do not have much time. <span class="italic">Scoreboard </span>sounds like skateboard in German. I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented, when and by whom. This Vitorino plan is what we need: clear, precise projects with a clear, defined timetable. Mr Vitorino, whom I would like to thank for his speech, can give us that, provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources. Let us give him those resources, then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown. I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten’s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises. Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress. The first is asylum. It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention. Decisions on asylum should take months – not years.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship – and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals. Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.</p>
<p class="contents">The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems. Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition. Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon. Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that it works out. The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular. Numerous questions are still outstanding. Answers are still awaited. Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding. On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life. The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future. However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force. In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed. We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control. The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC. Parliament has amended the contractual text. Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament’s <span class="italic">modus operandi</span>. Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors. And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe. Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems. This is the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres. </p>
<p class="contents">For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged. A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements. We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees. The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable. All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect. Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police. The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour. </p>
<p class="contents">Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships. The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed. Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up. The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action. The laws against racism must be harmonised. What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty? What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women? How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism? We must take the best from each of our countries. </p>
<p class="contents">When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years. The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.</p>
<p class="contents">In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants. Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses. How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population? What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic. It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time. We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up. There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice. Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area. And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice? The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions. Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development. A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society’s sustaining damage as a result. But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security, freedom and justice. The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen. That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems. The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society’s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU’s control. It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control. You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems. First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic. How is it envisaged that the EU’s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition? Think of last year’s deadly criticism of the Commission’s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability. It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question. But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies. As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists. The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed. In 1998, we had 55 murders. In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured. Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people. Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.</p>
<p class="contents">Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.</p>

This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons. The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum. We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants. We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship. The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough. They need a ‘European soul’, as a distinguished Spanish professor once said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino. This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said. As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated. Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months. The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune. As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months. The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny. There is so much legislation – and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week – but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it. And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on. I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime. That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about. But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example. We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ‘scoreboard’. Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is. A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible. I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so. At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make three brief points. The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament. It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together. Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate. Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process. Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission. We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told. There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived. We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard. The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda. All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area. Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.

The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete. The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this. The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some. </p>
<p class="contents">The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted. Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned. We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements. Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ‘<span class="italic">non-refoulement</span>’ [no turning back]. Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament. However, the main concern remains …</p>

I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to Eurodac. You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure. We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be. We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality. Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality. However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see. My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures. If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.</p>

I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member<span class="bold"> </span>States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.<span class="bold"> </span>Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer. Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and<span class="bold"> </span>what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime? Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration? How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe? In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?

We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many – there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg. There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense. We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security. We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these. But we must look always to subsidiarity.
