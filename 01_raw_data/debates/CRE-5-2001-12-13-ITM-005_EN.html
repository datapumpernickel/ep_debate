<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, you promised when you were appointed, Commissioner Kinnock, that the Commission would become the world’s best administration. I have confidence that you are the right person to tackle that task successfully. The issue of giving employees equal rights, irrespective of their sexual orientation, is a crucial step on the way. In the last twelve years, there has been a very positive trend towards enabling homosexuals to be granted the same rights as heterosexuals. In 1989, my own country, Denmark, was the first country in the world to introduce legislation on registered partnerships for homosexuals, corresponding to marriage, and a number of other countries followed suit. I would mention the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Finland. Other EU countries have implemented legislation which approximates to marriage to rather more limited degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the EU too, the trend is now in the right direction. Allow me to mention four very important points. Non-discrimination against minorities is now written into the objectives of European cooperation. On the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, discrimination in the labour market on the grounds of sexual orientation has now been tackled in practical terms. The Charter of Fundamental Rights expressly states that there must be no discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Finally, Parliament has recommended on several occasions that same-sex couples be guaranteed the same rights as heterosexual couples and that the Member States recognise registered partnerships. There have been very positive developments in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for the EU’s own institutions to comply with the same standards. I would therefore very much welcome your proposal. You have the key to nudging things in the right direction, Commissioner Kinnock. This proposal would enable homosexuals to be accorded full rights if there were partnership legislation in their own countries. I have a couple of questions in that connection. Since it is to varying degrees that the Member States’ partnership legislation approximates to the marriage laws, I would ask you to explain which countries’ citizens will be given full rights. Where will the Commission draw the line? Moreover, the Commission is paving the way for cohabiting heterosexuals to be given certain rights, for example the right to health insurance covering their partners. That is progress, but I should like to ask whether the arrangement also covers cohabiting homosexuals in all the Member States. For example, are cohabiting homosexuals from Britain and Italy entitled to these limited rights? Finally, a question on the timetable: when do you anticipate its being possible for these new staff rules to come into force in the institutions of the EU? Over the years, many Commissioners have promised the earth in this area, and nothing has happened. They have, however, set things in motion. They deserve full recognition for having done so, and I hope you can give a positive answer to the question we have put to you in this House today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – One of the proposals the Commission is making for modernising reform will extend access to certain family and social benefits to European Union officials who are currently denied such access because they cannot or do not want to enter into conventional legal marriage under the laws of the Member States. I am very grateful to Mr Lund and 32 other Members for initiating this plenary debate which enables me to report to Parliament on the issue of the Commission's intentions and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the current Staff Regulations, social and family rights are provided only for couples who are married. Whilst that most obviously refers to matrimony between two heterosexual people, it also relates to homosexuals if homosexual marriage is legally recognised in a Member State. The House will know that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is at present the only European Union Member State where marriage between two people of the same gender is legally provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, it is sensible to use the opportunity of current comprehensive reforms to revise the Staff Regulations in order to reflect the wide-ranging social change that has occurred in the time since the regulations were established in their present form in 1968. The Commission therefore proposes to ensure that staff who do not have access to marriage under the current national legislation are not discriminated against and to provide improved treatment for people who, for personal reasons, choose not to be legally married. To achieve this, the Commission seeks to provide full statutory recognition and commensurate benefits for all EU staff who are in partnerships that are shown to be stable in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the House to note that whilst we recognise that not all Member States' legal schemes for such recognition accord equivalent rights and status, the Commission accords equal recognition to all existing national regimes which make provision for stable partnerships. So far as we are concerned, the stable partnerships to be recognised will include homosexual partnerships which will be regarded in the same way as heterosexual partnerships and subject to the following conditions: firstly, the couple must provide a legal document of an EU Member State which acknowledges their status as non-marital partners. Secondly, neither partner may be married or in another non-marital partnership. Thirdly, there must no blood relationship in the first or second line between partners. Fourthly, that the couple must not have access to legal marriage in a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">People in recognised stable relationships that meet these requirements will be entitled to the family-related benefits that, under present Staff Regulations, are available only to heterosexual married couples and to officials who are homosexuals and of Dutch nationality. Those entitlements will include household allowance, health insurance coverage, survivor's pension and annual travel allowance. It will be clear to the House that unlike homosexual couples in all Member States other than the Netherlands, cohabiting heterosexual partners who are not married to other people could, if they so wish, get married. The Commission does not, however, ignore the reality that many people in modern societies wish to sustain stable partnerships but do not wish to enter into matrimony. We consequently recognise that many partners who have not married have family obligations. We therefore consider that those who are registered should be covered by provisions that, for instance, will enable a partner to participate in the European Union civil servant's health insurance scheme and will enable an official to use special leave provisions when, for example, a partner is suffering from a serious illness. The system envisaged for the staff of the European Union institutions largely replicates the system currently employed in the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">To obtain access to certain basic social rights under the Staff Regulations, non-married heterosexual partners must, as indicated, have documentary proof that their partnership is recognised in a Member State, they must not be married or in a non-marital partnership with another person and they must have no blood relationship with their partner. In addition to these two categories of partnerships, where the partners have chosen to be officially registered, there are also a limited number of cohabiting partnerships that are not recognised by any Member State since the people involved have chosen not to seek the legal recognition open to them. In such cases, the Commission proposes that the existing purely administrative recognition of certain partnerships should be maintained. This would, however, be of minor importance and the resulting rights would be limited. For example, partners would continue to have access to established language courses where places are available.</p>
<p class="contents">In its reform package of 30 October, the Commission approved the principles outlined above. We also decided to intensify discussions with other EU institutions and with other international public sector organisations in order to develop these proposals further. Finally, we reserved the right to make supplementary proposals after the outcome of the interinstitutional discussions which will commence formally in the early months of next year. The issue of recognised partnerships will be discussed at the next meeting of the heads of administration of all EU institutions. A working group will then further develop the Commission proposal, taking into account the additional information on the situation in other international organisations which is currently being collected. We naturally wish to pursue best practice wherever that is feasible and gains the endorsement of the legislatures, including this House.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this process, we will transmit our proposals for amendments to the Staff Regulations to the Council and to this House. We hope to be able to do that in the spring of 2002. The date of implementation of these new arrangements, and indeed much else, will therefore depend to a very significant extent on the speed at which they are handled in this House and in the Council. As for the Council, there is nothing to suggest that Member States will raise problems with this approach, particularly since it gives full recognition to the competence of Member States to regulate of marital law. It does not introduce a separate regime for the institutions – indeed, it cannot. This does not preclude the possibility, of course, that critical questions may be raised by Member States in the Council. We shall simply have to wait to see what views are actually expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on costs. For obvious reasons we do not yet know the exact number of recognised partnerships amongst the staff of the institutions or the numbers involved. We can, however, make a reasonable estimate, and on that basis, we can forecast that the budgetary impact of the above measures will be modest. Two hundred and fifty fully recognised partnerships and 250 partnerships with a limited range of statutory benefits would, for instance, generate total annual costs of under EUR 3 million.</p>
<p class="contents">When implemented, the measures we propose will recognise and respect certain basic civil liberties. They will foster enlightened attitudes and they will improve the morale and living conditions of many of the valued staff who work for the European Union in the different institutions. I hope that this House will continue to support these reasonable social innovations and I look forward to further constructive discussions.</p>

We will have a chance to return to this subject, as he says, when we get the detailed proposal for the Staff Regulations. The issues that he raised were covered very briefly in the report that I prepared for Parliament back in 2000, where we indicated that we were looking for a best-practice approach. The summary he has given us certainly indicates the amount of work that has been done on that. Given that it is a highly sensitive issue and Member States will certainly be looking at it closely, the sort of balance he has achieved is going to be very much the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we see this in the broad framework of recognising stable partnerships as he described it in the November 2000 discussion paper. That is really what we are discussing here. We are not talking about any particular type of partnership – that in itself would be discrimination – but recognising stable partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points I particularly want to raise with him is the question of children from partnerships. There have been well-publicised cases recently in the United Kingdom about the British forces. A soldier who very sadly was killed while on active service, had a stable partnership and a child from that partnership, but was not actually covered in the UK situation. That is an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I want to raise is in connection with pension provisions and about the rights and abilities of staff to be able to decide to whom their pension should be paid and what flexibility they have in making that decision or in opting for whom their payment and benefit provision should be made in the event of their death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to encourage him further. He is absolutely right that we should look at the best practices available. We in this House must remind ourselves that we cannot be selective in the application of principle. We look towards enlargement and encourage good practice, yet here in our institutions we still continue to discriminate. But I welcome the signs of change.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these will have the full support of this House and that we will begin to end the 'ping pong' game that we play with the human rights and civil liberties of ordinary men and women. For that is exactly what lesbians and gay men are. They are ordinary men and women made extraordinary by society's preoccupation with their sex lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say on a personal matter that in my own Member State, my partner of 18 years, cannot possibly inherit my pension. That is discrimination. We must end it both within and outside the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to raise one very important issue, namely recognition by an EU Member State of a legal document. Such a legal document is certainly not available in the United Kingdom. I look forward to Commissioner Kinnock's replies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Giving concrete form to the equal rights of homosexual employees of the European institutions appears to be turning into a never-ending story. Nevertheless, this House wishes to see European institutions playing an exemplary role in equal treatment, with no distinction made as to the sexual orientation of staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has twice pronounced in favour of establishing the same conditions of employment in the case of lasting relationships between people of the same sex as for married couples. Yet adequate arrangements for this have still not been made.</p>
<p class="contents">My group cannot help feeling that within the hierarchy of the institutions, including those of this House, barriers are still being created against the introduction of equal conditions of employment for lesbians and gay men. We therefore eagerly await the wind of change brought by the reorganisation, now entering its final phase, which will need to clear out the old dust traps from this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is glad that, immediately after the Dutch Homosexual Marriage Act came into force, the responsible secretariat in the Commission recognised such marriages where civil servants employed by the Commission are concerned. Member States where Dutch officials may be posted who are married under Dutch law to a same-sex partner must not of course obstruct the issue of residence permits, not even if it involves subjects of third countries. My fellow MEP Mrs Buitenweg has asked questions on this matter. Your Commission should make sure that such obstruction does not occur. As yet we have had no answer from you. Can you, Commissioner, give us one today? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Kinnock, I really did try to keep up with what was going on here. If I understand the matter correctly, the fact is that the partners of homosexuals who are not Swedish, Finnish or Dutch citizens seeking posts within the institutions of the EU are not recognised by these institutions if, as Mr Cashman says, they do not have documentation. Perhaps the latter could in those circumstances go on language courses at some stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, I personally do not, unlike certain others in this House, think that we have come a particularly long way. I appreciate, Commissioner Kinnock, that it is very difficult indeed to make progress in this area because we have a lot of strange prejudices about people of the same sex who love each other in the same way as heterosexuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I quite understand why the institutions of the EU should in this case treat employees on a national basis. If that reasoning were to be followed through, it would mean that people employed within the EU’s institutions could have their wages set on a national basis, but that does not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand, Commissioner Kinnock, that the situation is very difficult in view of the prejudices that exist, but I cannot agree that things are developing particularly quickly in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My point directly follows on from Mrs Eriksson's. It is clear that, in many Member States, homosexual couples do not have any rights and there are grave injustices within Member States. The only light at the end of the tunnel as regards my own country, Ireland, is that our Law Reform Commission announced yesterday – and I suspect it is because they saw something coming down the line from the Commissioner – that they were going to make that part of their research programme for the next year. Hopefully that will result in the justice that is clearly the right of stable couples, whether they be homosexual or heterosexual.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had situations where, because of the lack of rights for homosexual couples, people have been evicted from local authority housing on the death of the other partner who was the named tenant. We also see that huge death duties accrue to partners who have bought houses together where, on the death of one partner, the other is faced with a massive tax bill, very often resulting in that person having to sell what was, in the truest sense of the word, a family home.</p>
<p class="contents">I know you will be addressing some of the anomalies that exist in this but, as Mrs Eriksson has rightly said, they exist in a significant number of Member States and it could cause serious problems in terms of discrimination when we come to implement charges. I wish you every success and I am extremely glad that we have had an opportunity to raise the issue within this House because there is widespread support for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why should this be the case? It is because we are at an historic turning point, one where the issue is no longer solely that of combating discrimination against homosexual people but that of asserting the rights of homosexuals. At this pivotal point between fighting against and fighting for, I think that you have given us some very positive answers and that we need to continue in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">But why should I attach so much importance to this? Because I think that in our question we pointed out that some private companies had, after all, resolved the problem more quickly than the public institutions. We know how important it is for public institutions to set an example. I well remember the huge uproar in France when the French railways (the SNCF) decided to offer their 'couples' fares to homosexual couples. I do not think that you have had such good fortune in the United Kingdom, but we in France do, and it is the exemplary conduct of the French railways that I should like to highlight today, because this gives us some idea of what the European Commission can now achieve. That is why all of this is along the right lines, and why it is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, however, that for all this the fight against discrimination is not over, and I should like the Commission to also be aware of this struggle, in particular in the light of the fact that it has a Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Why could we not enlarge this to include other forms of discrimination under Article 13? We must not forget that there are candidate countries for accession, countries which will be included in the enlargement programme – I think you know the countries I am talking about – where homosexuality is still a crime. We must therefore be very vigilant; this is the 'fight against'. I am quite aware that this was not exactly the question you were asked, but nevertheless it seems to me to be important, if we are making progress on the social rights of homosexuals in the European institutions, for us to ensure that the current policies of all of the European institutions are consistent with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I should like to begin with the points made by Mrs Fraisse. She is absolutely right that we are at a turning point. There has been extensive evidence for this over a considerable period of time. Mrs Banotti's speech this morning is further evidence that even in countries where there has been a deep-rooted reluctance to change the social and legal conventions, there is movement in the direction of logic, rationality and civil rights. Things are starting to move, but everyone here is impatient for that movement to be much more positive and much more rapid.</p>
<p class="contents">The interesting point raised by Mrs Fraisse about the activity of SNCF permits me to underline a distinction that we still, unfortunately, have to draw about the legal nature, status and powers of the European institutions as employer organisations. SNCF is an example of a public corporation with its own statute and considerable internal autonomy. Therefore it could make its own decision in relation to the treatment of homosexual couples. The same would apply to a private company that is, in this respect, literally a law unto itself. Unfortunately, that means that company could show a severe degree of prejudice but it could also show a very positive degree of enlightenment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not in either of those categories. Nor are we in the category of a Member State which has passed a law which is positive about the treatment of stable homosexual relationships. Consequently, we are faced with a limitation because we are a public institution. Parliament, Council, Commission, Court of Justice, Court of Auditors – the whole panoply of European Union institutions – have a statute that does not permit us to exercise the degree of autonomy which is the basis for many of the arguments correctly put forward this morning. I include the arguments put by Mrs Erikkson for which I have a substantial degree of sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to answer very quickly the other questions, starting with Mr Lund. I would repeat the point I made earlier. Once a partnership is recognised under a Member State's recognition of partnership arrangements, we will give equal rights to everybody regardless of the benefit level applied under national legislation in the national context. Once the key is turned, we will accord the best treatment within our power.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the timetable. Together with the rest of the proposed changes in the Staff Regulations, we will submit a proposal to this House and the Council in spring of next year. It will then be in the hands of you legislators and the legislators in the Council to decide the speed of passage and – I hope – the early date of implementation of this and other necessary changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a point that relates to material that people in the House may want to get access to. A positive attitude was expressed in the Council towards our undertaking to make a survey of arrangements throughout all 15 Member States. We received answers from 13 of the Member States, so it is quite a comprehensive, if informal, survey. If Members want, on application, to gain access to that information DG Admin. will happily respond. The information we have collected shows that there is considerable diversity of arrangements. But – and here is the good news – as I said earlier, there is a gradual but definite tide of change.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour's question about children of stable partnerships is absolutely vital. The only answer I can give is that if a Member State recognises that the children produced by a stable relationship qualify for the variety of benefits, we will fully recognise that. Unfortunately, at this juncture we cannot go beyond that undertaking because of the limitations on our legal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Cashman asks us to pursue best practice, he knows he is pushing at an open door. But Member States determine the practices, and we have to try to encourage adoption of the best practices amongst them. We will happily consider, however, any proposal that stable recognised partnerships qualify if home countries recognise or if a country of employment recognises them. We do not have that second part of the proposal before us at the moment, but we will happily give consideration to such a proposal and investigate its feasibility. If it is feasible to establish practices in the European institutions on the basis of practices in the country in which an EU official is employed, we will try to introduce that change which could extend certain rights of registered couples, whether homosexual or heterosexual.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr de Roo that no barrier is being put in the way of the advancement of gays and lesbians who are officials by the hierarchy of institutions. That is not the case. It is the Member States who must determine what our treatment of gays and lesbians in relationships must be. So far as employment rights are concerned, rights of assessment and promotion, rights of appointment to management, there is no barrier and no hierarchy has expressed any direct or indirect desire to install such a barrier. We will not install barriers but we cannot guarantee that existing cultural or legal inhibitions can automatically be dismantled. We do not have the power to do it in the Commission. I wish we could in many ways, but I would be misleading the House if I suggested that we have, or are likely to get, that kind of massive power for change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to clarify a point that Mrs Eriksson made, the reference I made to very limited rights, such as the right to attend language courses, relates only to people who have the right to marry, or the right to have their partnership recognised but choose, for whatever reason, not to exercise that right. The access people have to various nominal social opportunities that exist now under the Staff Regulations will simply continue in those cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Our action, as she was good enough to acknowledge, owes nothing to prejudice. Our intention is to try to defeat prejudice because it is irrational and frequently brings brutal consequences. What we cannot defeat is not the prejudice but the laws that exist and are exercised in sovereign power by Member States. Not until we can secure changes in those laws – and this is gradually occurring – can we take substantial further steps beyond the significant steps that we are seeking to take in the course of this reform and which honourable Members have been good enough to acknowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
