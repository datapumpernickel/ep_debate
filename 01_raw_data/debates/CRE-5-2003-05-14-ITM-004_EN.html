<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Petsalnikos,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have the opportunity to bring you up to date on the current state of negotiations between the Presidency and the United States of America on the two agreements, one on extradition and one on mutual judicial assistance. These negotiations are now in their final stage. The text of the draft agreements was sent to the European Parliament two weeks ago. The Presidency hopes that they will be approved and signed at the JHA Council on 6 June. This will allow the Presidency to sign the agreements within the framework of the summit meeting of the European Union and the United States due to be held in Washington on 25 June.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are today in a position which allows me to be optimistic about the outcome of these negotiations, that is also largely due to the important efforts of previous presidencies. After a first round of negotiations under the Spanish Presidency, extensive negotiations were held under the Danish Presidency with the help of the Commission and the support of the Council Secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 28 February 2003, the Council agreed that the Presidency had conducted the negotiations efficiently, with an encouraging outcome, and that the negotiation of the agreements should be suspended, in order to allow time for the Member States to examine all relevant aspects of the text. Certain Member States are still in the process of consulting their national parliaments, which is why the Council decided at its meeting last week to facilitate the completion of the information process. The Presidency, I would remind you, has informed the European Parliament on the state of negotiations with the United States of America several times; in fact, the last time, we had the opportunity to inform the LIBE Committee on 20 March. If the Council on 5 June authorises the Presidency to sign the agreements on behalf of the European Union, certain of the Member States will need to follow their constitutional procedures, which implies approval or ratification by their national parliaments. Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union expressly allows Member States to state that they must follow constitutional procedures before being bound by an agreement. Indeed, certain Member States have already stated to us that they will be making such a statement. The European Union will only be bound following the exchange of the legislative acts with the United States of America, which will consequently only take place once the Council has taken a second decision authorising the Presidency to exchange the legislative ratifying acts with the United States of America. Between the signature of the contracts and the exchange of the ratifying documents, the Presidency will update the European Parliament on the text of the agreement on an ad hoc basis, despite the fact, of course, that the Treaty on European Union contains no such requirement. It is logical for this update to take place at this stage, given that the constitutional procedures have traditionally made provision for governments to seek the assent or advice of national parliaments on the final text of the agreement. Obviously a text only becomes final once it has been signed by the contracting parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency believes that this agreement has added value in comparison with current bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual judicial assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the United States of America. I must stress that, if we do not reach some sort of agreement, we shall have to live with the existing bilateral agreements which the Member States have concluded. In all events, the EU-USA agreements will not repeal bilateral agreements between the Member States and the United States of America. The agreements I am telling you about today are based on Articles 24 and 38 of the Treaty on European Union. They will exist alongside bilateral agreements. They will complement them and, in certain cases, they will replace provisions in the bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for us to understand that the Member States will be able to continue to cite the grounds for refusing extradition or providing judicial assistance which are contained in the bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual judicial assistance. If a bilateral agreement on mutual judicial assistance or extradition between a Member State and the United States of America makes provision for certain grounds for refusal, that Member State will be able to continue to cite them even once the EU-USA agreements have entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the draft agreement on extradition contains a provision which, as far as I know, has no precedent in international extradition law. It recognises that the state being asked to extradite a person may refer to its constitutional principles, which need not be included in the actual text of the constitution, but which can be enshrined in a text on equally as high a level as the constitution for historical or other reasons which are legally binding and which prevent it from honouring its obligation to extradite a person. In such cases, of course, the state requesting that a person be extradited and the state being asked to extradite a person must consult in order to resolve the matter. This also becomes particularly important with the express reference in the preamble to the principle of a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal established by law. This provision does indeed allow the Member States to refuse to extradite a person in the case of special courts, if they do not have this right on the basis of their bilateral extradition agreement with the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States which conclude new agreements with the United States of America in the future will clearly have to comply with these EU agreements, in that they will form part of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>of the European Union. Therefore, these future bilateral agreements will have to be compatible with the EU-USA agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Presidency, the negotiations were successful. We managed to make a positive contribution to the current level of assistance, to improve efficiency and, most importantly, to agree on additional safeguards. It is of the utmost importance that we understand that the agreements add safeguards to existing bilateral agreements and that, if these agreements had not been concluded, the present legal protection would have shortcomings in comparison to how things will stand when the agreements are concluded. The draft EU-USA agreement on extradition contains a provision which prohibits extradition in the case of the imposition or execution of the death penalty. This provision exceeds the level of protection for which provision is made in bilateral extradition agreements, given that it creates a general precondition for the result described and does not make the non-execution of the death penalty dependent upon the assurances of the Government of the United States of America in the case in question. Contrary to what has applied to date in almost all bilateral extradition agreements, the non-execution of the death penalty by the Government of the United States of America will not depend on the assurances given in the case in question by the Government of the United States of America each time on an ad hoc basis, and will probably be put forward as a precondition by the Member State in receipt of an extradition request from the United States. In addition, the Member States of the European Union can impose the precondition that the United States of America will not impose the death penalty. The United States of America will then be bound by this precondition, unless this is impossible for procedural reasons. One such case is when the death penalty has already been imposed before the person is handed over or when the criminal prosecution of the offence of which the person stands accused automatically implies the possibility for the competent court in the United States of America to impose the death penalty, as happens in very few states in the United States of America. The Member States that wish to follow their bilateral practice will, however, be able to do so if they do not apply this provision and/or if they make a joint declaration at bilateral level with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the other issues to which the draft agreements bring added value in connection with extradition are as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of sensitive information, the draft agreement allows consultations to be requested in order to determine the degree to which the information contained in a request can be protected by the requesting state.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to multiple requests, the agreement addresses the issue of the simultaneous submission of an extradition request by the United States of America and another state or when that other state is a member state of the European arrest warrant. Within this framework, I should like to mention the issue of the International Criminal Court, given that the Presidency is aware of the particular sensitivities and concerns of Parliament on this account. When negotiations started, it was agreed by both the negotiating missions that the agreement would not have any repercussions whatsoever on the relative positions of the Member States and of the United States of America with regard to requests by the International Criminal Court for a person to be handed over. The European Union and the United States of America agreed at the negotiation level to set this out in writing in an explanatory memorandum which states that Article 10 is not intended to affect the obligations of the states who are party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Consequently, the question of a simultaneous request for a person to be handed over from the International Criminal Court and an extradition request from the United States of America is regulated and shall continue to be regulated so that it is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Member States, while the Council will not be able to proceed to make any declaration on this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to mutual judicial assistance, some of the main achievements of the negotiations with the United States of America are to be found in the following sectors: the draft agreement improves cooperation in the field of investigations into the possible financial elements of serious crime, including organised crime, terrorism and fraud. The Member States which do not at present have an agreement on mutual judicial assistance with the United States of America can fall back on public order, security, national sovereignty or other interests of the state in receipt of the request in order to refuse to transmit information in some cases. The agreement contains extensive provisions concerning data protection and the provision of evidence and information. The draft agreement contains provisions which facilitate the use of joint investigation teams and the facility for teleconferencing between the Member States and the United States. These provisions make it easier for the Member States to use these facilities but they do not oblige them to use them. The draft agreement permits the use of modern means of telecommunication, facsimiles or e-mail in order to exchange requests for mutual judicial assistance and replies with express confirmation of receipt. Mutual judicial assistance, insofar as this sort of thing does not already happen under bilateral agreements, can be used by the administrative authorities both in the United States of America and the Member States, when they are conducting investigations into criminal behaviour with a view to criminal prosecution or to reporting such conduct to the investigating or prosecuting authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you once again for giving us the opportunity to give Parliament a progress report on negotiations between the European Union and the United States of America on the extradition and mutual judicial assistance agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the information you have provided, but unfortunately I do not think you have responded to the oral question tabled by my group. It remains outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the agreement before us is especially relevant for both the European Union and the United States. The United States has decided to foster closer cooperation, especially in relation to the fight against organised crime. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as rapporteur I therefore feel we must welcome this type of initiative. I am especially pleased that for the first time the European Union is going to sign an agreement on cooperation on judicial and criminal matters. This should serve as a model in arriving at similar agreements with other third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would however like to provide some additional details on three issues. Will this agreement make the fight against organised crime more effective? As I understand it, it will. This level of cooperation will clearly help the fight against money laundering, trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Will this agreement reinforce the European Judicial Area? I think it will inasmuch as it will oblige Member States and candidate countries to speed up the ratification of the European texts that form the basis of this agreement. These texts include the protocol on money laundering and the decision on the detention and surrender procedure and on joint investigation teams.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question is whether these texts represent added value over and above the bilateral agreements currently in force. I have to say that the answer to this question is also affirmative. As regards existing agreements, the new agreement will streamline cooperation and provide for increased guarantees to be given in the interests of those accused.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I feel I must draw the attention of the Presidency of the Council to the doubts expressed by Parliament, as reflected in the question that led to this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we want to be sure that the same guarantees offered by the European arrest warrant would apply in the case of the United States issuing a request for extradition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the doubts over whether a Member State has the capacity to decide if a person should be sent to the United States or referred to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Although there is an explanatory note on this in the text of the agreement on the International Criminal Court, as you mentioned, we believe it would have been much clearer if this reference had been inserted into the text of the agreement. This would have eliminated the uncertainty on the subject and made it quite clear that a Member State may take that decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue relates to procedure. I would like to highlight a positive and also a negative aspect of this subject. Firstly, we would like to thank the Greek Presidency for publishing the text of this international agreement before it had even been signed. This allowed Parliament to consider its contents. An important precedent has been set. Nonetheless, this cannot be deemed adequate in terms of democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">I will move on to outline the negative aspect. To date, the European Parliament has never been consulted on any similar international agreements, even when they concerned fundamental aspects of foreign policy and cooperation on judicial matters. In our opinion this is unacceptable. Furthermore, unfortunately agreements of this type do not have to be ratified either by national parliaments or by this House. When neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments are involved, how can we say that the European Union’s actions in this regard are in line with the democratic principles on which it is based under Article 6 of the EU Treaty? This is why it is appropriate for the European Parliament to be consulted and not merely informed, as you have said.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel this is a central and highly relevant issue. I communicated this to the Presidency of the Council in a letter sent in December last year. I could not understand why I did not receive a reply. I also made the current President-in-Office of the Council aware of the strength of feeling when the latter appeared before meetings of the committee I chair.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the liberties and fundamental interests of the citizen’s of Europe are at stake. We are dealing with judicial and criminal cooperation, a subject on which the Treaty provides for a closer level of cooperation than that provided for by the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I would therefore like you to reconsider your position should no consultation be allowed for. I also call upon you to convey Parliament’s opinion on this matter to the Council. I have communicated this opinion to you in the strongest terms. If our message is not brought before the Council, Parliament would have to consider the possibility of taking its case to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to thank the Presidency once again for the positive attitude it has shown in relation to such a sensitive dossier, as demonstrated by your presence in the House.</p>

Thank you very much for being here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have strongly defended the European search and arrest warrant in this House. In doing so I have argued strongly that international cooperation, not the restriction of rights and freedoms is what will make us better able to deal with new security problems. I therefore think that in principle increased cooperation with the United States is a positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to raise a number of questions here and now. My questions concern the contents of this agreement with a country whose judicial system remains significantly different from ours.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question relates to the fact that there is a guarantee that a person who is extradited cannot be condemned to death. I understand this; it has been made very clear. I would however like to know how we can guarantee that judicial cooperation and the handing over of evidence does not amount to collaborating to ensure someone is executed. I would welcome further clarification on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now outline my second question. The European search and arrest warrant will not come into force for a few months. It provides for the International Criminal Court to prevail. When, in the future, Member States are bound by this arrangement, how will it be possible to guarantee that a summons issued by the International Criminal Court takes precedence over a request for extradition issued by the United States? There are indeed measures that protect against the <span class="italic">Patriot Act</span> and extraordinary laws. Clearly, we are not going to hand a person over to the United States if he or she could be tried under laws of that kind. This leads me however to pose another question, relating to politics rather than to the contents of the proposal. There is evidence that at least twelve European citizens are being ‘detained’, if I may put it like that, in Guantanamo Bay. Has the Council taken any action to guarantee the right of European citizens to proper consular protection abroad, as provided for further to the Maastricht Treaty? Has the Council instructed the Commission to take such action? Or are we to admit that there are different classes of citizens? Has anything been done to ensure the United States allows the detainees to appear before a judge?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, is it politically acceptable to sign an agreement strengthening judicial cooperation with a state that is keeping nationals of our countries in such conditions? I firmly believe it is not. How will we be able to call for justice from third countries in future when we find ourselves in a similar situation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, 18 months ago when I had the honour to serve as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this House adopted a resolution on judicial cooperation between the Union and the USA. That resolution set out four key requirements for any extradition agreement: full respect for the European Convention on Human Rights; no extradition of persons likely to face military tribunals; no extradition if the accused risks facing the death penalty; and that any measures affecting data protection should be proportionate, effective and time-limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist outrages in Saudi Arabia on Monday night once again remind us that terrorism still poses a deadly serious threat. We need a robust and effective response. However, the Liberal Democrats in this House insist that anti-terrorism measures must always respect fundamental rights and be subject to proper democratic oversight and control. Striking the right balance is essential to success in fighting those who seek to undermine the fabric of democratic societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The current draft agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and legal cooperation must not escape the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in our Treaties. They concern 'fundamental choices' within the meaning of Article 21. They fall not only under Article 38 but also under Article 24, and it is scandalous that the Council does not consult this House in advance on all the Article 24 agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, the <span class="italic">Conseil d'Etat</span> has refused the <span class="italic">Assemblée Nationale</span> the right to approve such agreements: so unless the Council consults us, what parliamentary scrutiny exists in the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements on extradition and legal co-operation are very ambitious. The United States declines to sign the UN conventions on cybercrime, on crime prevention and on the International Criminal Court. In the Union, Member States have not yet ratified our decision on money laundering or the framework directive on terrorism. Yet these proposals cover the whole Palermo agenda. They should at the very least provide for the establishment of bodies to oversee their operation and provide feedback.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only regret that this agreement makes no reference to the International Criminal Court. I would urge the Council to rectify this. The Council must seek to reconcile the potential conflict between a request from the ICC to surrender a person to the court and the obligation stemming from this extradition agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The slide away from democracy can start with the best of intentions. The European Union must guard against it. Do not let the Council's haste facilitate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just draw attention to the fact that, under Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty, Parliament has no right whatsoever to be heard. It is an extraordinary provision, which means that the Council can enter into these agreements off its own bat.</p>
<p class="contents">In April of last year, the Council wrote to the British human rights organisation, State Watch, which had requested information about these agreements, and said that the negotiations that were under way had to be kept secret, since the Council’s interest in secrecy counted for more than its interest in democratic scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to see why the Council has kept these negotiations secret for more than a year, for, if they lead to an agreement, very important parts of the legal certainty by which most of our legal systems are characterised would be successfully abolished at the stroke of a pen. Broadly speaking, the state of our law would be reduced to something reminiscent of what it was in the Middle Ages, both by the extradition agreement, which goes very much farther than what was urged, covering, as it does, very many more types of crime than terrorism – it is enough to have been sentenced to one year’s imprisonment under the penal legislation of the country by or from which extradition is requested – and by the second part of the agreement, namely that relating to what is termed mutual legal aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Ask the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. These agreements are being entered into with the United States in the name of legal certainty at the same time as everything is being done to infringe legal certainty. Ask the 3 000 prisoners – overwhelmingly foreigners – suspected of terrorism and consigned to American jails without having access to any information. Ask the eleven million active FBI informers who, if this agreement is ever implemented, will be given permission to operate within the territories of the EU countries. That would, as has been said, be a decisive retrograde step. As I said before, this Parliament has no influence at all, either legally or constitutionally, but the debate may be of use in raising the storm that will be necessary for checking these attempts to undermine legal certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to thank you very much for being here with us today, but I am also quite aware of the fact that we have virtually no room for manoeuvre at all, given that, as you yourself have said, everything may well have been decided by 5 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, negotiations on matters which are absolutely crucial for the citizens’ freedoms and rights are being carried out, or rather have been carried out, with a complete lack of transparency, and we have only been able to see behind the veil where <span class="italic">faits accomplis </span>are concerned. The Council persists in refusing any kind of formal consultation of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At times like these, when there are many who believe that democracy and rights can be exported by means of unlawful wars, I find this particularly disturbing. We consider it to be a clear violation of the Treaty, and we are assessing the feasibility of appealing to the Court on the grounds of violation of the prerogatives of the European Parliament. I genuinely hope that the majority of Parliament will be of the opinion that it is possible to lodge an appeal of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many grounds for scepticism and concern regarding this agreement, including the failure to give priority to the European arrest warrant in the event of simultaneous requests and the ambiguity which persists even on matters on which there is as little disagreement in this House as data protection or the death penalty. We wonder, moreover, why it is that we are in such a hurry to conclude this agreement when we know that a number of European citizens are being held prisoner wholly unlawfully at Guantánamo, as has already been mentioned by other Members, and that nothing is known of them.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union and Parliament want to live up to their reputation as at least verbal champions of rights, we must get moving and send a delegation without delay to ascertain the conditions in which those citizens are being held before we sign an agreement with the United States. It will be interesting, and possibly even amusing, to see whether the United States allows us to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we would like to receive answers on the possible – or rather, probable – contradictions between this agreement and the Statute of the International Criminal Court, on which, I regret to say, you did not focus, President-in-Office. We would like a clear response to the following questions. Is it true that the United States, actively supported by the United Kingdom, is opposed to any reference to the Criminal Court in the agreement? What will happen in the event of conflict between the Rome Statute, in particular the obligation to cooperate with the Criminal Court, and the EU-US extradition agreement? Lastly, given the unambiguous position of the European Parliament, not least, which is opposed to the bilateral agreements guaranteeing the impunity of US citizens, could you please tell us whether any of the present or future Members of the European Union have been asked to sign these agreements? Do you know of the existence of any agreements of this kind? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand it is important that we support our NATO friends where possible in the fight against terrorism. It is also in our own interest that together we fight against organised crime. If this becomes easier as a result of the extradition and legal cooperation agreement, then that is a major gain. At the same time I can see that the legal systems of the United States and the European Union are not the same. It is logical therefore that the United States cannot be treated on a par with an EU Member State. The United States is a democratic unit in which human rights are guaranteed, but their interpretation is not always the same as that of the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the death penalty now appears to have been settled to general satisfaction by the Council’s compromise. There is still the question of competing extradition requests by way for example of a European arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. I understand that the Council has discussed this and also recognised it as a problem, but can this be adequately resolved by leaving it to the Member States? There is also the question of whether the requirements of the European data protection directive can be adequately met. In view of these sensitivities the Council has rightly decided to put these proposals to the national parliaments for ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Donner, the Dutch Minister of Justice, declared that the proposals remained within the limits of current Dutch treaties with the United States. His calm reaction was a relief after the overwrought reaction of various fellow parliamentarians at home and abroad. There are some who are making the United States into a bogeyman. No wonder they are not leaping at the chance to become involved with the International Criminal Court. I understand that the Council has reached a compromise here too. Member States can conclude a non-extradition treaty with the United States with representatives dispatched by the government in Washington. This provides an opening for further negotiations. I am assuming that the Council will be keeping us informed about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, there is the possibility that this situation could affect many areas and send out an undemocratic image of the European Union, especially to the candidate countries. At the Parthenon, we celebrated the advent of the democratic Europe, yet, at the first part-session which our observers – the few that are here – are attending, we must in all conscience kick up a fuss, because you are not consulting us on key issues such as the one in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into details on this subject, particularly as I have very little time. I wanted to say to you, Mr President, that you have said very little about the Criminal Court. I also wanted to say to the House that it is, in any case, important to take account of the extradition provided for by the Rome Statute. The handing-over of those who are accused is not extradition in the legal sense of the term. The fact that this is not discussed is not, therefore, a problem in itself. Naturally, Europe must remember its undertaking to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Statute as well as the contents of the declaration of 30 September 2002. This declaration recommends to all candidate countries and all Member States that they should not sign any bilateral agreements that would go against the principle that is the basis for the Court, which I am glad to say has existed since 11 March and will, I hope, be able to start operating very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rules and criteria adopted will therefore serve as useful benchmarks for similar agreements with many other third countries, and that is another reason why they must be considered carefully. The Union is bound by the provisions of the Treaties and the acts signed by its institutions. In matters of respect for fundamental rights, it is bound by Article 6(1) and (2) of the Treaty on European Union and by the Charter on Fundamental Rights, which lay down more stringent guarantees than those provided for in third countries and, in particular, in the United States – I too am thinking of the European citizens still imprisoned at Guantánamo – and it is therefore these provisions of the Treaty, not respect for individual rights in general, which must be referred to in the EU-US agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The reservation not to cooperate if the accused is liable to face the death penalty is expressed in relation to extradition but not – as it should be – where judicial cooperation is concerned. This is a requirement that binds not just the Member States but the Union as such too, which does not have the power to conclude agreements which provide for derogations from this principle. I therefore consider Article 9 of the agreement on judicial cooperation to be inadequate. Then it is absurd that the Council should conclude agreements with third countries which it has not yet implemented within the Union because the Member States have failed to ratify the agreements or because of failure to implement framework decisions which have already been adopted. It is also absurd that, as provided for by Article 10 of the agreement, a request for extradition from a third country might take precedence over a request from a Member State to hand a person over made by virtue of a European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore remedy these shortcomings, and the agreement will then be a model for European Union cooperation with third countries to combat international crime, with due regard for the fundamental rights which the Union acknowledges all human beings to have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In itself this is an extraordinarily important agreement and it is therefore all the more a crying shame that the consultation of the various people’s representations is not properly organised. In my own country, for example, the agreements had to be read in a room because the agreement was a secret one. We have now had them handed out and I wonder whether this method of discussion is the right one? I share the view of the Chairman of our Committee that we may possibly have to go to the Court of Justice if a different procedure is not followed.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event I have some specific questions. Is it right that the American Government should refuse to accept the International Criminal Court? Can you say explicitly what role the Council is planning to assign to the International Criminal Court? Have the candidate countries been consulted? This proposal does after all affect them too. Is not the lower limit of one year, on the basis of which people can be extradited, far too low?

That was the essence of the discussion on the European arrest warrant. If the Council is to have its way such trust will have to be placed blindly in a third country outside the borders of the European Union, namely the United States. In my view this is, for the present, a bridge too far. First, a critical and public debate on this matter is required. After all, we are dealing here with fundamental human rights, personal freedom of movement and the preservation of personal safety and property. It is surely unacceptable simply to try to force citizens and their elected representatives to swallow important amendments to those rights whether they like it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">First as regards the extradition treaty. The norm for extradition between the US and the EU Member States is to be that an offence should carry a minimum sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment. For some Member States that already have a bilateral extradition treaty with the US this is nothing new. But conspiracy, participation and an attempt to commit an offence will also require compulsory extradition and that is definitely far-reaching. But for Member States without a bilateral extradition treaty and for Member States that operate a so-called positive list there will be a sweeping change. My question to the representative of the Council is therefore whether we can be given a list of the various consequences of the implementation of the treaty for individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As is generally known, the rights of suspects are not generally adequately protected in the United States. The European Union must guarantee the civil rights of its residents, in this case those of suspects and convicted persons. I doubt whether the Union will be able still to do so when this treaty is implemented. It should be possible, at the very least, to demand that the treaty refer to the ECHR and that EU Member States should not be permitted to depart from it in implementing this treaty. That is why the escape clause on the problem of the death penalty is totally inadequate. It is not sufficient that EU countries should be able to refuse extradition, if there is a threat that the death penalty will be imposed, no, they should be bound to refuse. Better still, Member States must include a provision in the treaty giving them the option of trying cases themselves if extradition to the US is refused. In that case EU citizens would at least be assured of an adequate legal process with guarantees secured within Europe for the trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The treaty on judicial cooperation in the criminal field raises the question of the judicial and political responsibility for the consequences: the detection teams. Is <span class="italic">Miami Vice</span> about to arrive in Europe? Experience has taught us that the US has far less rigid views than our own on the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. Who is to sound the alarm if in the future we are confronted with American agents who introduce a system of logging off?</p>
<p class="contents">Other Members of this House have already pointed out that data protection is not adequate. In conclusion, I should like to warmly support what was said by the chairman of our committee, namely that he finds it unacceptable that the Council should yet again refuse to consult Parliament. We simply cannot accept this any longer and to be quite honest, I fail to understand how the Greek Presidency dares to continue the process by repeatedly making fools of this House. I find this nothing short of scandalous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Désir (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in the fight against international crime and terrorism, there is already cooperation between the Member States of the European Union and the United States as regards information and this has produced significant results. It must be developed at judicial level in order to improve efficiency, but also in order to comply with our fundamental principles and the protection of freedoms. Indeed, the more effort we put into stepping up international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other forms of crime, the more care we will have to take not to lose the democratic guarantees and legal principles on which our action is based along the way. Like Mr Watson, I would also mention Parliament’s resolution of 13 December 2001, and, in particular, the principles it set out concerning the negotiations on judicial cooperation with the United States. Firstly, complete respect for the European Convention on Human Rights and minimum procedural guarantees of a fair trial, as confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights. Article 6 of the Treaty establishing the European Union must be mentioned explicitly in the agreement and there should also be a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was proclaimed by the Council, by the Member States, and will, I hope, be given constitutional value. Secondly, extradition to the United States must be refused for people who may be tried before military tribunals. Thirdly, extradition must not be allowed if the defendant is liable to be sentenced to the death penalty. Mr Alavanos is right: it is not simply a matter of stating that it ‘may be denied’; it must not be possible if there is a risk of execution. Fourthly, we must ensure that the provisions on data protection are proportionate and effective and only last for a limited period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the connection with the European arrest warrant and the International Criminal Court, I believe that, where there is a choice, the Member States must be free to choose between requests for extradition by the United States and requests to hand people over under the European arrest warrant or from the International Criminal Court, but I would like you to inform us of the positions in the Council. Is it true that the United States rejects all references to the ICC and a number of Member States support this position? The United States has asked for a reextradition clause to be included in the agreement that would prevent an EU Member State sending a US citizen to the International Criminal Court or another international tribunal without its express agreement. Is this request also supported by Member States? Lastly, does the Council acknowledge that such a reextradition clause would be contrary to its commitments regarding precisely the International Criminal Court and the Rome Statute? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Petsalnikos,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I have listened with particular attention and have noted the views, comments and observations expressing specific and justified concerns on the part of the Members of the European Parliament. I shall try and reply to these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as regards the role of the European Parliament in relation to the procedure to conclude these two agreements. It will perhaps be superfluous, but I am obliged to remind you that the agreements being negotiated are based on Articles 24 and 38 of the Treaty on European Union, in which, unfortunately, no provision is made for some sort of role for the European Parliament. On the contrary, provision is made indirectly, not to say clearly, for referral to internal constitutional procedures. However, over and above that, we as the Presidency consider that, after the signing, a detailed progress report must indeed be given and we must listen to the views of the European Parliament. Despite the fact, in other words, that there is no legal basis under current provisions, as Presidency I repeat and emphasise that the Presidency will update the House and the House will also have the possibility of expressing its views on the two texts, because we too consider that, on such important issues, there must be continual contact and a two-way exchange of information with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the comments made on the International Criminal Court are concerned, I should like to repeat and stress that the draft extradition agreement makes express provision in an explanatory memorandum, as I said, for the obligation to extradite to the United States of America not to affect the obligation to hand over to the International Criminal Court. So I would say that it expressly safeguards the right of each Member State to honour its obligations towards the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as regards simultaneous extradition requests in relation to the European Arrest Warrant. The draft extradition agreement leaves every Member State complete freedom to choose which country a person will be extradited to. I would remind you that, within the framework of the European Union, when we debated and agreed on the European Arrest Warrant, the idea of the arrest warrant from one Member State taking precedence over every request to extradite to any other third country was not accepted. However, even if we decide under our own internal procedures in the future to give such priority to the European Arrest Warrant, the draft agreement contains a special provision which makes it easier for us to take such a decision. Specifically, it acknowledges that the future development of the European Union may have repercussions on the application of the agreement and makes provision for the agreement to be reviewed in the light of these developments. However, I repeat that, under the draft extradition agreement, every Member State also has the facility to decide itself which country the person requested will be extradited to.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as regards the relationship between the EU-USA agreements and the bilateral agreements which apply between the Member States and the United States of America, I shall repeat what I said in my first intervention that the EU-USA agreements do not repeal individual bilateral agreements between the Member States and the United States. The EU-USA agreements will bring added value. That is what we want. For there to be more assurances, over and above those that apply within the framework of the bilateral agreements signed to date by the individual Member States and the United States of America. What we want precisely, and this was also what we were trying to do throughout the negotiations, and this is what we are trying to do until the agreements and our negotiations with the United States are completed, is for there to be the necessary guarantees for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which will respect the constitutional principles of the Member States. I think that it is an achievement that the references both to constitutional principles and to public security etc. which have been included in both draft agreements are now express references. And, of course, the Member States who so wish will be able in future to further strengthen the framework agreement in question with the United States by concluding bilateral agreements, if they wish, and going even further, provided of course that they are compatible and add even greater value in comparison with the EU-USA agreements being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards special courts, both the extradition agreement and the mutual judicial assistance agreement, in other words the drafts of the agreements, expressly stipulate that the Member States may continue to cite<span class="bold"> </span>their reasons for refusal already set out in the current bilateral agreements which they have concluded with the United States of America. In addition, the draft extradition agreement expressly recognises that constitutional principles may obstruct extradition, which is why the agreement makes provision for a specific consultation mechanism. Moreover, in the preamble to the drafts of both agreements being discussed, there is an express reference to the principle of a fair trial, including a hearing by an impartial, ordinary court, and to the question of special courts, which do not fit in with the judicial legal culture of Europe and are a matter that we raise at every meeting and in all talks with the United States delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the death penalty, and here I must also refer in connection with the death penalty to the draft on judicial assistance, because perhaps it is clearer than in the draft on extradition, and point out that, on the basis of Article 13 of the draft agreement on mutual judicial assistance, the Member States have the facility to refuse a request for assistance from the United States of America if they consider that the execution of the request might affect their sovereignty, security, public order or other fundamental interests. This wording which we have managed to get included, and this was an objective pursued on the European Union side, gives the Member States the facility to refuse assistance if they consider that the evidence, information etc. requested may lead to the imposition of the death penalty. Under Article 9, Paragraph 2, a Member State may also impose additional conditions on the United States of America with regard to the further use of evidence, for example, that it should not be used for prosecutions which lead to the imposition of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall continue with regard to the death penalty on the basis of the comments made by Mr Alavanos. The arrangement in the draft agreement with the United States of America has been put there precisely in order to bring more added value to existing bilateral agreements between Member States and the United States of America, which do not contain adequate guarantees. There are cases in which the current agreements have not to date contained adequate guarantees. And in every case, the provisions in the bilateral agreements, I must stress, are not affected. In other words, if some current bilateral agreement is more advanced, this <span class="italic">acquis </span>is not affected. On the contrary, on the basis of everything we have included in the draft, we go much further, by safeguarding and guaranteeing that the death penalty will not be imposed, will not be executed, than a series of bilateral agreements which have no such guarantees. The wording 'may be denied' does not mean that the Member States will ignore their constitutional principles, which will be expressly cited in their entirety. And, of course, I must remind you that all the Member States have signed and ratified the protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights banning the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by thanking Parliament once again for giving us the opportunity to update and listen to you and to assure you once again that we shall listen to the views of the European Parliament with particular attention before the completion of all the procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
