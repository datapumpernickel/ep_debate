<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in this debate on a resolution that has jointly been tabled by five groups. This clearly expresses our joint concerns about the executions of women and, more rarely, men by the cruel and barbaric practice of stoning and about the sharp rise in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventy-five people died in 2000, 139 in 2001 and so far this year 250. We note the letter of 23 October from the Iranian ambassador to the EU, assuring us that there have been no cases of stoning in recent months and that directives have been issued by the competent authorities for the cessation of this process and are being observed. Nevertheless, we are not entirely reassured while sentences of death by stoning continue to be passed and while the use of the death penalty more generally continues to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the EU generally protest against the use of the death penalty throughout the world, whether it be in the United States, China, Japan or anywhere else, and Iran is no exception. Nevertheless, we recognise that sections of Iranian society are trying to move on. Forces of progress who want to see a less cruel form of Islamic society exist and they are growing in numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution does not threaten talks between the EU and Iran regarding future trade and cooperation agreements, though it is clear that this will include a human rights clause. The European Parliament, which has to approve such agreements, will watch with close attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do of course endorse the material need for dialogue between the European Union and Iran. However, I simply cannot understand why negotiations on a cooperation and trade agreement between the European Union and Iran should begin on 29 October. Parliament has called on numerous occasions for cooperation agreements or financial aid to be suspended or frozen when human rights are being violated. So why are we applying this double standard?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decided on 22 October, just two days ago, not to table a human rights resolution on Iran at the next sitting of the UN Commission on Human Rights. I find that totally unacceptable. I cannot but wonder if the reason for not wanting to expose the Iranian Government now is that it does not square with the policy on Iraq? We in the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left support the joint motion, although it does represent a shift from the real resolution on human rights to a composite resolution on human rights plus cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but we think that parts of items 4 and 5 are wrong for the reasons I have mentioned and we have therefore applied for a split vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I really would be delighted if the hope reflected by this common motion were to be fulfilled, by which I mean if an end to human rights violations in Iran were to give us cause for optimism. However, present circumstances alone give me no cause whatsoever for any such belief, which is why we must raise our voices, at any rate here in Parliament.</p>

As far as I can see, this draft resolution seems to be remiss on one particular point from an editorial point of view. The four Iranian women condemned to death by stoning have not been fully named with first names and surnames – see the end of Paragraph 3. Of the four names mentioned, for example, two at least would be considered to be generally used as first names. I therefore propose a correction to the text for the sake of the case of these condemned women.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking metaphorically, the dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran on human rights is very much an uphill struggle. From the European perspective, we have to guard against being responsible for obstructing the way ourselves. Any hand extended by Iran is therefore welcome. We welcome particularly the valuable gesture made by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Kharrazi, to an ad hoc delegation visit of this Parliament on 20 July, who wanted direct contact between representatives of the Iranian legal system and EU lawyers. I would like to see the Council and the Commission seize this offer as quickly as possible. After all, the Iranian sentences, which have been rightly challenged, can be dealt with by this motion for a resolution at a correct and conclusive level. The chance of this type of contact should also be seized upon in order to oppose the barbaric sharia punishment of stoning. For let there be no misunderstanding with regard to Europe’s position towards Iran. We cannot and will not live with a system which condones stoning fellow human beings, wherever this may be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dialogue with Iran is important, but our main concern, as the European Parliament, is for a human rights dialogue. As parliamentary representatives, we are free from diplomatic constraints when it comes to demanding this universal principle, which is why we say loud and clear to any country concerned that we reject the death penalty in general.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rise in the number of death sentences carried out in Iran compared with previous years is concerned, I should like to state here how I evaluate the situation. Conservative forces within both formal and informal structures are obviously using death sentences carried out or corporal punishment inflicted to intimidate both the people and the liberal forces in parliament and other societal institutions. It has nothing to do with Islam or the Koran. Because internal pressure is increasing, so is repression.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must stick to the demonstrable facts in all our criticism and check every allegation, irrespective of its source. That is why I am against overloading the resolution with allegations which, in the final analysis, we cannot prove, thereby undermining our own credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">People have been sentenced to be stoned to death. We have proof that two of these sentences were carried out in the first half of 2001, but not for 25 September 2002. Let us therefore make use of Iran's readiness to discuss all human rights issues, including individual cases, without preliminary conditions, as expressed in talks with the EU-Iran Human Rights Exploratory Experts mission<span class="italic"> </span>at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">I still worry that the Council has drawn the short straw by officially refraining from tabling the annual human rights resolution on Iran at the United Nations. It is not the Presidency that deserves to be criticised here, but the usual suspects who feel their plans may be upset.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do say is that it is good that they want to talk; let us hold a comprehensive dialogue and, if we see improvements, only then should we refrain from tabling new resolutions in due course. There can be no upfront concessions at the expense of human rights. Given the situation, we should clearly remind the structures in question in Iran – and in my view the Council and Commission as well – of one thing. A negotiated agreement will only come about with Parliament's assent and the issues to which we shall be paying particular attention are those I have just addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Barbaric punishments are still being carried out. The backward and medieval practice of stoning still forms part of its criminal justice system. Individuals are publicly hanged, hands are chopped off for minor transgressions and eyes are even put out without anaesthetic. Women are predominantly the victims of this inhuman judicial procedure. If Iran is serious about opening itself up to the West, if it is serious about a dialogue with the European Union, then this violation of human rights has to stop. The extreme nature of the sharia represents an insurmountable obstacle for normal relations. There can be no question of a trade and cooperation agreement with Europe as long as the human rights situation is not resolved. The negotiators working on behalf of the European Union have to make this very clear right from the start. Does Commissioner Kinnock agree with me on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we cannot abandon a condemnation resolution in the UN if Iran continues with its evil infringement of universal principles. This is not a question of a successful human rights dialogue with the EU as was suggested, but of a successful abolition of barbaric methods. The European Union cannot afford to isolate Iran. It is very important for reformists to be supported in their battle for a democratic and more humane Iran. The younger generation wants change and offers hope. Unfortunately the Iranian authorities do not know how to handle the situation. But there is no substitute for openness and democratisation. Modernisation can only triumph if barbaric practices and an evil past are brought to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As long as Khatami’s adviser on women’s affairs considers stoning to be a measure which underpins the family, we can only consider this to be truly horrible.</p>
<p class="contents">Since our resolution of 13 December 2001, 250 people have been executed in Iran, and 75 the previous year. How can they speak about progress! It does not look as if the human rights situation is improving. I find that the motion for a resolution placed before us for our vote is not sufficiently clear. Despite the visit by a European delegation in connection with human rights, there were still five public executions on 30 September. We therefore condemn the European Council’s decision not to introduce a resolution about human rights in Iran before the next sitting of the UN Comission on Human Rights in Geneva. We want to state clearly and unambiguously that this resolution must be introduced before the next sitting. We want to say in all clarity that the European Parliament cannot assume that we can discuss cooperation agreements if there is no real improvement to the situation on human rights in Iran and that is why we have not signed.</p>

It is also a country with which the West has had troubled relations over a number of years. In rejecting Western consumerist values, Iran radicalised itself and supported radical Islamic groups in Lebanon, such as Hizbollah. There is added complexity because the conflicts with the West have long been bound up with internal disagreements within Iran itself. Recent years have seen a growing awareness within Iran that this isolation was harmful to Iranian interests and leading nowhere. The result has been a thaw in relations which we should welcome in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations will depend on fundamental progress in the areas of human rights and illegal immigration, weapons of mass destruction, in particular the country's nuclear weapons programme, drugs, the Middle East, Afghanistan and the battle against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to drug trafficking, the Iranians, who have a very serious drug problem of their own, should be commended for their efforts and cooperation. They have also resisted the temptation to destabilise Afghanistan and have indicated they will not attempt to foment instability in Iraq in the event of Saddam Hussein's departure from the scene. Iran needs regional stability, and this has been recognised by the Iranian leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Middle East, Iran has joined Saudi Arabia in accepting the principle of 'land for peace', if that is what the Palestinians want. All of these developments are important and very welcome. Iran needs to understand that Europe is extending the hand of friendship and that ways can be found to live together without Iran losing either its identity or its opposition to the worst of Western values. It would be wrong for the European Union to overstress the issue of capital punishment per se, which remains legal, if used appropriately, in international law. It is practised in the world's largest democracies such as the USA, Japan and India and is supported by tens of millions of citizens in my country, the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran's leaders, however, should be in no doubt about the universal horror felt by us about the barbaric and medieval Sharia punishment of stoning to death. I urge the Iranian leadership to reflect on this and to find solutions commensurate with Iran's dignity and history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The practice of stoning men and, in particular, women, not only continues to be provided for by law but is frequently applied, as is shown by the many death sentences already pronounced. As we are aware, in the coming months, a further four women will be stoned under a legislative framework which forces an oppressive, discriminatory system of control on women.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as respect for fundamental rights is concerned, the deterioration of the situation in Iran has been pointed out and emphasised by a number of organisations as well as a UN General Assembly resolution and the most recent report produced by the Special Representative of the UN Human Rights Commission on Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in the dialogue taking place between the European Union and Iran, the Union’s exploratory mission did indeed record willingness on the part of the Iranian Government to discuss human rights issues, including specific cases, but this verbal expression of good will has not been borne out by any practical measure. Quite the opposite: the situation seems to be deteriorating. Although it is true that we must welcome signs of cooperation from the Iranian Government, we also need to realise that the increase in executions and the continued stonings are a negative sign for the Union, which cannot accept them out of respect for its own Charter of Fundamental Rights and the international conventions. It is therefore imperative that, at all stages of the current dialogue, the Union makes clear that it is an absolute necessity that Iran guarantees respect for fundamental rights, especially women’s rights, and that it reiterates the need for Iran to abolish the death penalty, the practice of stoning and all other inhuman or debasing practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That applied above all, of course, to the Iranian people. We all hoped that he would be able to lead Iran onto a more democratically open and tolerant path. Unfortunately, we have all, time after time after time, been disappointed. The latest reports are frightening. Journalists, intellectuals and critics of the regime disappear and are tortured, imprisoned and put on trial for trivial reasons. The death penalty is frequently applied. In that respect, Iran is one of the world’s worst offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest reports of women having been stoned to death according to ancient sharia laws are utterly hair-raising. The fact that this is happening in 2002 is completely unacceptable. A whole world turns in abhorrence upon Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the EU and Iran are characterised by a certain amount of caution, which is good. If these relations are to become meaningful, the issue of human rights must always be at the top of the agenda, however. I would also draw attention to the fact that Parliament has its veto when it comes to acknowledging possible agreements, and this is something we shall use if the situation does not improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be completely schizophrenic, on the one hand, to say that we want to see a strongly critical resolution in the UN and, on the other hand, to enter into a trade agreement with the same country. Let us think for a moment. Of course we must embark upon the critical dialogue with Iran, and if this yields fruit in terms of our no longer seeing stonings or barbaric death penalties and sentences in Iran, then we can of course begin to pave the way for trade agreements.

<p class="contents">Both sides need to make an effort if we are to achieve this objective. On our side, we need to show we are willing to acknowledge the history of this vast country, as well as its present situation and the natural and socio-economic factors which shape it from both within and without.

<p class="contents">On Iran's side, its leaders must realise that the West, and the European Union in particular, will only open up to and work with the developing world if it respects human rights; these are not values Europe wishes to impose, they are ecumenical values and they include women's rights, which are particularly prone to abuse.</p>

Naturally, the Commission continues to be concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and, in particular, by the persistence of repressive measures against democratic institutions, civil society and the media.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevalence of arbitrary arrests, torture, discrimination against minorities and evident lack of the rule of law are all deeply disturbing. The all-too-plentiful evidence of the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, including the appalling stoning of children, of women and of men, continue to demonstrate the scarcity of civilised standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective way to raise these concerns is through the half-yearly comprehensive dialogue meetings, bilateral talks at ministerial level and similar sustained activities. In addition, avenues for more direct and specific dialogue have been explored recently by the troika, as several Members said.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 October the GAERC endorsed the strategy for starting a human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the recommendations of the exploratory troika mission that visited Teheran from 30 September to 1 October last. During these explanatory talks, the Iranian Government voiced a political will to enter into a human rights dialogue and to do so largely on the EU's terms. No restrictions were requested in relation to the list of human rights issues to be discussed and the dialogue will be regularly assessed with the help of specific and realistic benchmarks, such as reports from the visits of the United Nations thematics rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue would initially take the form of an experimental round table in Teheran in December of this year. Its format will be assessed immediately after the first session and could be revised, as necessary, in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening of negotiations with Iran on a trade and cooperation agreement, indissolubly linked to instruments on political dialogue and counter-terrorism, gives the European Union substantial leverage, since the progress in the negotiations will be directly related to parallel progress in, among other things, human rights. This connection is at the heart of the political package defined at the June Council and formally adopted on 12 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a structured EU-Iran dialogue on human rights is obviously not a complete antidote to the variety of deep and serious concerns. At this juncture, however, it seems to constitute the most effective available means of promoting our attempts to bring about tangible improvements in the grievous human rights situation in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise that, in all of this, our concerns relate to the basic rights and well-being of human beings, regardless of their faith, regardless of their customs. That is the fundamental value that guides us and provides the motivation of the European Union. We will continue to act upon those fundamentals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
