I would like to say straight away that these points are nothing new. Many of these have already been discussed here before, but there are a number of issues that deserve additional emphasis. In the first place, aid granted to the countries of the Western Balkans needs to be linked to support. This is not the first time that this has been said, but I believe that it has to be stressed again. Cooperation with the international war tribunal at The Hague is not something which all countries can simply agree to and subsequently act as if that agreement does not exist. That is, and that ought to be, a genuine concrete condition which must be in place and continue to be for the granting of support. The same applies to another subject – the return of refugees – to which everyone agrees, but where practice has shown in this respect too that many countries do not deliver what they have promised or do not do what they ought to be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us look at the fight against corruption and crime. Many fine words have also been uttered in this context, but unfortunately in practice it is shown that corruption continues to occur as far up as at government level, for example the last government in Macedonia. The European Union cannot continue to inject money into that region while that is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point in my report is the need to gain an insight into what will be the future of Kosovo. We cannot have the situation where Kosovo continues to exist whilst the Kosovans want something else, but we just hang onto the 1999 UN resolution. I do not have the solution, I do not know whether I am for independence or self-reliance, but I think that it is up to the European Union to start the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two more points which Parliament is absolutely right to ask for, time and again, and which need attention. The first is the necessity to prepare education at all levels for a non-ethnic future. The school books are nothing to write home about. They are continuing to repeat the old patterns. That is not acceptable; it is the breeding ground for fresh conflict. Secondly, it is clear again, from all the elections, how important it is for the media to be independent. In almost all of the countries, the media play a disappointing role in the establishment of democracy and that must be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going quickly through the points because I feel they are important issues – that have already been brought to the fore earlier by Parliament but not, unfortunately, looked at in sufficient depth. I am aware of the dangers to some extent and I would be keen to have an open discussion about these points with other Members and also with the Commission. We all, including the Commission and Parliament, run the risk of being hidebound by a pattern, a way of thinking and working with the Balkans which arose in the nineties, based on the greatest dangers which existed then. These were extreme nationalism and ethnic hatred. Although these problems have not yet disappeared, I believe that the situation has changed so much that the greatest problems now in our considerations and our way of thinking about the Balkans are not getting the attention they deserve. In my opinion, the relevant problems are economic and social crises, stagnation and a growing disappointment with the effects of democracy. At this very moment, there is the risk that our interest in the Western Balkans is waning. I only have to point out that we are sitting here in a Chamber that is almost empty. When we discuss enlargement, the room is full, when we discuss the Western Balkans, there is just a handful of people, the usual suspects, who are prepared to speak on this issue – and Europe simply carries on. This cannot continue; the European Union can no longer afford this.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for the Balkans is falling, from 900 million a few years ago to 500 million in 2005. This is why I was so impressed with a report which I have just received, entitled <span class="italic">Western Balkans 2004</span> from the <span class="italic">European Stability Initiative</span>. This sets out in minute detail what the problems are now and what potential solutions the European Union should find to deal with them. One crucial observation is that the period of reconstruction is over. This has been reasonably successful and the EU has achieved a certain amount of success with it but now something else is needed. Industry has been decimated or allowed to decay. Many small businesses have grown in its place but have not been able to solve the problem of unemployment and there are absolutely no prospects for large sections of the population. Pursuant to this report, which I broadly support, what should that mean for the European Union, the Commission and Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we must learn from the successes of the structural and cohesion funds. These have been successful in southern Europe and I think that the time has come to apply the methodology and the approach of the structural and cohesion funds also to the countries of the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, this would mean that the agency for reconstruction that we have had up until now ought to be turned into an agency for development. This will also have to mean that, after the current enlargement by ten countries, the remaining candidate member states and the countries of the Western Balkans will be brought together into one DG, because the problems of Bulgaria and Romania are not essentially any different to those of the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also have to mean that part of the pre-accession monies, which is soon only available for Romania and Bulgaria, can also be spent on the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">More of the same is no longer enough. There is no point in having more and more sessions with the same people discussing the same policies. A genuine change of direction has to take place and this has to happen quickly. I am strongly in favour of such action and I make an appeal to the Commission and to each of us, the Members of this Parliament, to sit with each other and see what is now necessary for the Balkans. What we have done up till now has been successful but it is not sufficient for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council need Parliament´s active support in order to achieve the long-term objectives of the process. Recent elections in south-east Europe have shown that the region has made tremendous progress, although much still remains to be done. The result of these elections unfortunately reflects how disillusioned a significant number of voters are with the political process, and how frustrated they are by the pace and impact of the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The stabilisation and association process must be a pragmatic policy. It should have a long-term view. It has to be flexible and needs to focus on the objective of promoting stability, democracy and economic development in south-east Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have however noted what Mr Lagendijk said regarding conditions. I agree with him on strengthening of the rule of law. This is a key and decisive element for the region. As he says, it is also important for the media in the region to be stable and independent. Above all, it is essential to understand how to adopt a more structured approach to the distribution of direct and indirect aid to this sector financed under CARDS.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Kosovo, ladies and gentlemen, I would nevertheless like to make some things very clear. We are all concerned about the situation there, but United Nations Resolution 1244 should remain the legitimate point of reference for all our actions. This is why the Commission fully supports the regulatory policy already approved by the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to pre-accession funds and other funds for this area, we must not confuse the different types of funds. Pre-accession funds are targeted specifically and are limited to, designed for and directed at supporting the countries we are negotiating with, and for whom a timetable exists. Ten of these countries are likely to accede next year and 2007 has been suggested for the other two. We cannot confuse the different types of funds. The allocation of fund to the Balkans is quite a separate issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too believe that we must proceed with a policy which has yielded good fruit in recent years in terms of reconstruction and, in addition, consider the next step, which is the issue of democracy and legislation in those places.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries lie at the heart of Mediterranean Europe, and it is therefore in the common interest of all the Community institutions, as well as our duty to the peoples living in the area, to provide the aid, decisions and related measures necessary to help these countries address what we feel are the current fundamental problems: problems in the field of education and training, combating organised crime, and, in particular, the endeavours to achieve democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights these problems clearly. It underscores them and emphasises the role of the European Union. It also highlights the attempts – hesitant but clearly being made – to establish greater legal protection, particularly where women are concerned – which I welcome – but that is not enough. This report displays the European Union’s interest: it must be followed by more practical measures than those hitherto provided for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this sense, today's report by Mr Lagendijk is a good report and we are all the wiser for having debated it. The situation in the region is indeed complicated, complicated from the political standpoint, from the social standpoint, and from the developmental standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">Our intervention in the Balkans, therefore, is not technocratic intervention, it is political intervention, because new institutions need to be built. Now that every institution has been destroyed, nations which have been in conflict need to be encouraged to communicate and the entire social, political and developmental environment needs to change. So our efforts have to be unwavering, they have to take an unwavering approach which avoids controversy and they have to be in keeping with UN resolutions. Any philosophy of change could give rise to renewed crisis. Secondly, the nations in the area need to make an effort to communicate with each other again; this will also foster economic development because these countries all used to support each other's economies. Thirdly, it is good that the countries in the area as a whole will soon all be members of the European Union, from Romania to Bulgaria, Austria, Greece and so on; in other words, there will be a positive impact on developments in these countries from all sides. And then we shall need to do our utmost, politically, to help these nations, which lived in peaceful coexistence for hundreds of years, to regain their historic foothold, to rediscover their <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span>, to rediscover the political union and common way of life which, unfortunately, have been upset over recent years by untimely movements and careless initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, Paragraph 4 rightly calls for attention from the Council and the Commission for the political future of ancient Kosovo Polje. In this connection, the negative contribution from Belgrade is disappointing. According to Michael Steiner, UN representative for Kosovo, this city is like a hot potato which the Serbian leaders pass quickly on. I would be pleased to learn from the Council and the Commission of their experiences and of the efforts they have made.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the local elections of 26 October in Kosovo offered little encouragement as regards the Serbian contribution. A heavy price was paid for Belgrade's conflicting appeals for very limited participation on the one hand or, on the other, for everyone to turn up and vote. In fact, the boycott of the elections by the Serbian population of North Mitrovica meant a complete rejection of the very generous seven point plan proposed by UNMIK chief Steiner – a proposal that, however, actually wants to go a long way towards meeting the interests of the Serbian minority in a predominantly Albanian Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, I find myself struggling with the highly idealistic composition of the rapporteur’s amendment to Paragraph 40. Very sensibly, the original text of this paragraph urges a rapid end to the actual situation whereby the town of Mitrovica does not fall under the authority of UNMIK and the interim government of Kosovo. In concrete terms, that means the disappearance of parallel Serbian security and administrative structures, financed with Serbian money. And that is totally along the lines, and in the spirit, of Steiner’s seven-point plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, with a brief, factual addition – which referred to the seven-point plan – the rapporteur would have lent the paragraph more power of expression, for clarity and decisiveness on the part of the international community is for the benefit of all Kosovan inhabitants for the sake of their collective future. How do the Council and the Commission feel that they can, within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe, lend support to Steiner’s noble efforts to make Mitrovica into ‘a normal European town’? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to start by saying that I totally support it, and that applies equally to my group. This part of Europe is a multi-speed region. Some countries, such as Macedonia and Croatia, already have agreements; theirs are stabilisation and association agreements, although that does not of course necessarily mean that all the conditions are being complied with in detail. Joost has already listed the deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, with some satisfaction that we can consider Albania, a country which has managed to make up for the fraudulent elections held in 2001 by electing a consensus president, something very few people expected, including the Commission. We would now like to see an early start made on the negotiations around this process, although we know that it will not be concluded rapidly, as there is still a lot of homework to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has to be said that this country is struggling to square the circle. I am referring to the Dayton Agreement. I simply wish to say, for example, that 67% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entire budget is spent on ministers' salaries. There are over 120 ministers who only exist because they are virtually stipulated in the Dayton Agreement. Something has to be done about this and the last elections were a warning signal.</p>
<p class="contents">Serbia and Montenegro's President and Prime Minister are squabbling with each other instead of jointly fighting for their country. Serbia and Montenegro should now be finding a joint path towards European membership, and the Solana proposal, no matter how limited it may be, is at present the best and the only way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Kosovo, which I visited again just last week, I can only say that we should be able to make sure that its peoples can coexist, thus making Serbian enclaves unnecessary. They have many problems in common. There are ethnic tensions in some countries, there are unsatisfactory refugee return arrangements, there is the battle against trafficking in human beings, which is also unsatisfactory, and there is corruption. Only one thing is clear, and that is that we must not back off from our commitment. That is the litmus test for our credibility. As Joost has already said, we need to have a precise idea of what we wish to achieve in this region in the near future.</p>

I genuinely believe that the Stability Pact and the Stabilisation and Association Process have chalked up a lot of successes overall. Some of these have already been mentioned, such as the elections in Macedonia and developments in Albania, although I have to say that I have heard that the consensus reached between the major political groups in Albania is now at breaking point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to comment on some of Mr Lagendijk's fundamental observations, because they seem very important to me. You mentioned the debates on enlargement and the debates on the Balkans. I was present at both debates today, and I was also at the enlargement debate, at which President Prodi made a statement that I consider to be very important. He pointed out that the enlargement process with the ten new countries and also with the subsequent applicant countries has not yet been completed, and that this gives an important signal to the Balkans in particular. I believe, and I also stated this in my own speech, that our experience with preparations for enlargement must act as a signal – and this applies to the Balkan countries too – that countries that advocate democracy, the rule of law, protection of minorities and human rights have a chance of joining the European Union at a later date. I believe that we need to consider now how we are to manage the organisational requirements. As I see it, the Stability Pact – and this is Mr Bussek's intention in his role as Special Coordinator – needs to become more focused, with a reduced role and tasks being increasingly transferred to the Commission. This should not, however, take place outside the enlargement process, but should come in at the latest with effect from 2004/2005, when the new Commission will meet in accordance with the enlargement process. I accordingly believe that we in this House need to give the Balkan countries a signal, or rather hope, that they too have a place in Europe, bearing in mind the Zagreb II Summit also. It will then be up to them to decide if they wish to do all this so as to effectively secure a place in Europe.</p>

It is also its most severe test. Our efforts to provide these countries with economic and political support are much needed. We certainly should not put them on the back burner because of the enlargement of the European Union. In fact it is that very prospect of a future in Europe that we need to hold out to them. That is the purpose of the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider the rapporteur's proposal that priorities should be set an extremely sensible one. Kosovo's final status needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency, as does the structure of Serbia and Montenegro in terms of constitutional law. Until we have done that, it will simply not be possible to enter into negotiations on an association agreement. The ill-defined status of Kosovo is a latent source of uncertainty. It means that business has no trust whatsoever in the situation and that there is inadequate investment. This leads in turn to an increase in corruption and to a growing trend towards emigration, in other words migratory pressure that we in Austria are particularly, but not exclusively, sensitive to. One of the most important conditions, and this applies to the entire region, is to impose the rule of law, and to fight corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">One very positive step here has been the creation of the Regional Centre for Combating Transborder Crime in Bucharest, and this centre will be represented at the relevant conference in London on 25 November. We visited this centre in Bucharest together with Dr Swoboda, and I should perhaps mention that those who work there include Austrian customs and police officials. It would be good if this centre had more input from Europe and not just from America.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I consider important is that under its Special Coordinator, Erhard Bussek, the Stability Pact has taken a great many political initiatives. It should be possible for this work to continue, and we need to achieve rapid agreement both in the Council and in the Commission on appropriate budgets for and extension of the Stability Pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
