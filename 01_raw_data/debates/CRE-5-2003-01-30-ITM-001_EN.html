<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I very much regret that the Commissioner is unable to be with us. It seems to me that it might be wise to adjust our arrangements so that the Commissioner himself could read the text to be adopted. He ought to see the agreements reached in the common resolution through. We would then transcend mere words.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we all agree that the terrible scourge of hunger in the world casts shame on all those who are in a position to prevent it. The figures speak for themselves. We are all aware of the alarming statistics. Nonetheless, I believe they bear repetition. I would venture to say that we are numbered amongst the lucky few who live comfortably, in an affluent society. Meanwhile, 900 people die of hunger every hour. In addition, 800 million people are malnourished and 300 of these are children.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worse, the numbers remain stubbornly high and we are light years away from reaching the target of halving the number of malnourished people by the year 2015. That was the date set at the 1996 World Food Summit and confirmed in the Millennium Declaration. It is not a particularly ambitious target. Nonetheless, we are unlikely to reach it despite the fact that a number of countries have made determined efforts to reduce poverty and improve food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The current state of affairs as portrayed by these statistics proves beyond all doubt that the time for words and for grand declarations is long since past, particularly if account is also taken of the implications of malnutrition and their negative impact on development in the countries concerned. Hunger cannot wait. The time has come to take a quantum leap as regards the strategy needed to rid ourselves of this scourge. We need to go to the very root of the problem if we are to deal with the structural causes of world hunger.</p>
<p class="contents">Tackling the root of the problem and going beyond the current crisis means making human development a priority. A two-pronged approach is called for. In the short and medium term it is necessary to focus on food safety and food sovereignty, crucial to alleviating present-day hunger. In the longer term, sustainable growth for less-developed countries must be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of such a two-pronged approach would be to help establish the social, political and economic framework needed to allow those countries to eliminate poverty and start down the road to development. The causes of hunger and underdevelopment are many and varied. Consequently, a wide range of remedies must be deployed in the effort to reach these twin targets. All the factors contributing to hunger need to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Natural disasters, droughts, floods and desertification are but some of these factors. Others include armed conflicts, civil unrest, political, social and economic upheavals, the AIDS pandemic and the foreign debt incurred by the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Two main courses of action can be identified. On the one hand, regarding food sovereignty, it is essential to promote small-scale farming of sustainable and diversified crops. This is provided for in the common resolution we trust will be approved in plenary. Urgent action must also be taken to ensure the development of viable networks for local distribution, access to land and to water and the cancellation of foreign debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the reduction of poverty and with development in mind, priority should be given to education. I mean education for all, girls included. Girls tend to be excluded from educational programmes as a matter of course, and are thus also excluded from all potential development of their countries. Increased technological capacity should also be fostered as part of this drive towards education and training. By technological capacity I am referring in particular to productive capacity. Efforts to combat diseases linked to poverty, notably AIDS, must be stepped up. What I actually have in mind are all the measures designed to promote good governance and the rule of law. As indicated in our resolution, I also believe it is particularly important to facilitate access to the markets on equal terms, and on a reciprocal basis. Measures that distort trade should gradually be done away with. More specifically, as is also stated in the resolution and in line with the agreements reached at Doha, I believe agricultural subsidies should be eliminated. I am not referring merely to the European Union. After all, the Union’s market is the most accessible to the less developed countries. Rather, I am thinking of the whole international community, especially the richer industrialised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to set the less developed countries on course for sustainable development to eliminate hunger we cannot shy away from these measures. They are essential and have to be taken. Peace itself is at stake, at both a social and international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been countless statistical reports. The most recent, the report by the World Food Programme, warns us that 38 million people are likely to die from lack of food, drinking water and medicines in the coming months. Yet we must openly admit that the international community is not yet doing enough. This is not the central item on our political agenda, as it should be. This is not the main criterion considered by the Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G8 in their actions. If we do not change our approach and speed up our action, if we do not succeed in regulating the globalisation processes with environmental and social sustainability, the historians of the future will judge our civilisation very harshly for this failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus on the diseases related to poverty, on malaria and tuberculosis. Let us consider AIDS, a scourge which has already claimed 25 million victims, let us remember the 14 000 people throughout the world who contract the HIV virus every day. Prevention is essential but it is not everything. It will be difficult to find excuses in the future for the fact that we do not succeed in treating 95% of the people suffering from AIDS. It will seem a real crime, considering that modern medicine can do a great deal to change AIDS from a terminal disease into a chronic condition and, in particular, to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to child. Therefore, the European Union must put active pressure on the United States so that an agreement can, at last, be reached to exclude from intellectual property rights and patentability those drugs which, if used freely, will save the lives of millions of people. This would go hand in hand with the intention to give a greater financial undertaking and with this draft regulation, which we hope will be adopted without delay at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the decision to grant free access to the European market to products from less developed countries is important. The European Union must now shoulder the responsibility of expressing the principles and positions we are discussing today in all international fora, starting with the World Trade Organisation. Only thus, with a new form of governance on a world-wide scale, with greater participation and transparency, with practical decisions and measures, will we be able to combat hunger and poverty and win this challenge, the greatest challenge facing mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite frankly, I would include among these the difficulty of converting a genuine impetus generated by many non-governmental organisations for rapid change and for a policy of assembling critical voices into a positive drive for change and reform, and, in this regard, I would refer to the recent statements of the President of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, who both calls upon the institutions to do more and calls upon civil society to direct its critical gaze at the shortcomings of globalisation in a constructive way, setting substantial goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that it is right, including in the instrument before Parliament today too, for greater attention to be given to the dreadful situation in some parts of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, where some millions of people are in real danger of losing their lives. It is clear to all – and the document we are about to adopt illustrates this well – that the situation can only be improved by correcting and modifying the structural errors and dreadful inadequacies of many governments which have continued to channel their money in the wrong direction, despite the fact that experience has shown, in the light of the facts, that it is necessary to change their approach in order to eliminate the root causes of poverty, the root causes of hunger and malnutrition and the lack of information whose consequences are an appalling health crisis and the denial of education and training to tens or hundreds of millions of people. Moreover, it is clear to all that, in many cases, barriers to trade are another key factor which needs to be eliminated. That would bring more freedom and, therefore, greater competition and more opportunities in addition to urgently-needed humanitarian measures. This is what the European Parliament is striving for, and I believe we must all support it today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions of human beings live in extreme poverty and every hour of the day many die of hunger. It is therefore crucial that rapid and far-reaching measures are adopted in order to put an end to this situation, which must surely weigh on humanity’s conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that we adopt structural measures that are capable of preventing conflicts arising. It is equally crucial to follow up these fundamental measures with emergency measures to save lives now. The emergency humanitarian aid that has been provided to date has proved to be inadequate, where both food and medical supplies are concerned. We must, for example, provide a more substantial response to campaigns for high-risk areas, such as the awareness-raising campaign ‘Hunger in Africa’, launched by the World Food Programme. We must also support timely initiatives such as those launched very recently by the new president of Brazil, Lula da Silva, both the initiative intended to eliminate hunger in his country, with the programme ‘Zero Hunger’ and the other initiative presented in Davos, which is of a universal nature and calls for an international fund to be created to combat poverty and hunger in the countries of the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally crucial however, as I mentioned previously, that fundamental measures are adopted, breaking first of all with a model that has proven to be inadequate and unfair, which places the least developed countries in an inferior position and treats them shabbily - particularly by claiming that everything can be resolved through trade - which perpetuates an unfair system of trade that attaches sole priority to economic growth and ignores the importance of a fair distribution of the wealth that is created.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a new world economic order, in particular one that contains profound changes in the bodies that are today crucial and which have guidelines that are out of kilter, such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. A definitive solution must be found to the problem of debt and it is particularly necessary to ensure stable prices that compensate for the traditional forms of production in the least developed countries, mainly in the primary sector. Priority must also be given to food sovereignty and food safety, in particular by guaranteeing that natural and human resources are harnessed and that people have access to land and water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Famines are the result not only of weather conditions but also of the structural policies, especially agricultural and trade policies, which have led farmers in poorer countries to produce for export rather than for local consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of food aid is not a viable solution. Though claiming to be humanitarian, it has often been used by rich countries as a way of disposing of their agricultural surplus and of legitimising their devastating policy of over-production. Thus, the United States is keen to send to Africa its GMOs, which are being boycotted on the European market, not only in the form of food but also as seeds. It then has the audacity to accuse governments which refuse this aid of allowing their populations to die. To use such blackmail on vulnerable people is shameful. It goes against the fundamental right to food, which gives all human beings the freedom to choose what they eat. Who is the more guilty here? Is it the countries affected by famine who refuse to feed their people with potentially harmful products, or is it the countries who supply aid to deprived people only in the form of genetically modified seed, the consequences of which will be disastrous for the environment and for biodiversity?</p>
<p class="contents">In some of these countries or regions, the food crisis is not a general crisis. The problem is not necessarily the lack of food, but rather the fact that it is not distributed fairly throughout the world. Only local production and intra-regional trade are sustainable and able to guarantee access to food for everyone. The European Union, however, extols the virtues of free trade at world level and forces the developing countries to open their markets. In return, it promises to open its market to all products from the least developed countries, except arms – and, of course, bananas, and sugar and the rest. Not only has this measure caused competition between developing countries rather than strengthening their market shares, it is also encouraging the production of crops for export, to the detriment of food crops that would enable them to be self-sufficient. In the same way, the current crisis among coffee producers is a reminder that free trade means that small farmers are being ruined while the big multinationals prosper. Free trade is not fair trade. Moreover, there is no reference to fair trade in the new Commission Communication entitled ‘Trade and development’, which Parliament will shortly have occasion to examine. President Lula made the fight against hunger his top priority. He is proposing to create an international fund for this purpose. That is also the objective of the FAO, whose recent summit does not seem to have had any significant impact.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Greens, the only way of eradicating hunger throughout the world is by the sustainable development of food production which is based on the needs of local populations, and fair trade between North and South – in other words, trade which pays a fair price that reflects the social and environmental costs of production and the resources and workers of poorer countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is almost no aspect of the problem that it does not discuss. That being said, we must, however, state that our arrangements so far have been quite inadequate. We also state in this resolution that the gap between developed and developing countries became wider during the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it important to emphasise three shortcomings of the resolution. First of all, no mention is made of efforts to reduce the birth rate in the developing countries, given that poor countries are quite obviously in no position to create economic growth that can keep pace with the very rapid increase in the number of inhabitants of these countries. Secondly, the resolution contains no discussion of the internal states of affairs that prevent people in the developing countries from living in freedom. We recoil from removing those dictators who destroy people’s living conditions and the structures of their countries. We want to have clean hands, and we believe that everything can be achieved through diplomacy, but we have to observe – as the resolution does too – that a great many of the countries whose populations suffer hardships quite simply do not have the freedom that is necessary for people to be able to change their situation. During the Iraq debate yesterday, we again saw very clearly that we do not want to make a point of removing these dictators by means other than words and diplomacy. Only the United States is prepared to remove the oppressors by force. Thirdly, our resolution indicates the need to reduce tariff barriers, but we forget to say that we lack credibility because our agricultural policy entails our dumping products on the poor countries’ markets, so destroying their own agriculture’s potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Our civilisation lacks, as it were, the basis for appearing ‘worthy of imitation’, because we cannot implement in our own countries the economic and political changes that are a basic condition for changing the trade situation and for our being at all able to improve the disastrous situation the world is in. It is disgraceful that we are in no position to take more far-reaching decisions in this area. I hope that everyone who votes in favour of this otherwise excellent decision today will be consistent and vote against the EU budgets that authorise the agricultural subsidies so damaging to the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution deals with problems that lie at the root of the crisis of which the food shortage is the persistent result. The global economic recession is certainly taking its toll. Economic decline hits poor countries hardest. This concept is extremely relevant to the relationship between hunger and trade, although it is not mentioned in the joint resolution. This omission soon results in poor countries being shown up as being insufficiently willing to liberalise or as having domestic structures that are too weak to cope with healthy economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this cause of acute food shortages, I would like to mention another external factor: the debt problem. Was debt cancellation not agreed in the context of the ‘jubilee year’ 2000? No more than half of the debt cancellations promised in 2000 have been realised to date. This is directly linked to trade, as exports are often used to pay off foreign debts. As long as a country is not free of this burden of debt, therefore, there will be constraints on the impetus that trade can offer for development in the country itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the risk of going over the top in the quest for liberalisation. The resolution asks for developing countries to be given the leeway to make their sectors sufficiently strong before tackling international competition, and rightly so. Prescribing one-sided protection measures is going too far, however.</p>
<p class="contents">This request for a sensible method and degree of liberalisation shows the sense in controlling the WTO process, a point that the resolution is right to touch on. It would be better if this control was carried out in a national context rather than by international institutions. The minister is, after all, responsible and approachable. The European Commission may be an important player in Europe, but this does not change the principle: the WTO members determine the course of trade liberalisation. Responsibility therefore lies primarily on that level; it is also most clear-cut there and forms part of national policy with which the citizen can identify. Conversely, this clarity is much less evident in international bodies with a large number of players and interests, such as a parliamentary assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there are of course also factors that fall under the sphere of influence of developing countries themselves, such as good management and a strong economic structure. A greater diversity of export products forms part of this. The ACS Agreement has not yet resulted in this diversification in the exports of the least developed countries. I would like to find out what the European Commission’s strategy is with regard to actual diversification and what efforts it is making to achieve this. I am pleased that the Commissioner has arrived, as I would like to address this question to him.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of ongoing concern is HIV/AIDS and the disastrous effects this has on the body, social relationships and the economic structure. In this regard I would specifically like to ask to what extent the European Commission uses the highly preventative effect created by marital fidelity. Incidentally, is the Commission willing to allow the scope for this in its policy on the basis of the highly successful results achieved in various African countries where this forms part of the information strategy?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the resolution is to a certain extent bogged down in highlighting problems and does not mention any strong approaches to their resolution. Because of the balanced approach to the issues in the problem, the resolution nevertheless gets my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a question I submitted to the Commission, endorsed by several of my fellow Members – whom I would like to thank – and which has led to today’s debate, I focused on the problem, which we have addressed in the past and are continuing to address in part, of the link between trade protectionism and world hunger and poverty. You see, I believe that opening up the markets is, in political terms, more costly than granting aid. In today’s debate, too many plans are being addressed, in my opinion; it would be better to concentrate on this issue and press the Commission in this regard. Opening up the markets means challenging the market positions of extremely strong lobbies, particularly the agricultural lobby in Europe and the United States, the textile lobby in Europe and the United States, and so on. This type of policy is much more difficult, I repeat, than policies to grant aid, something which probably no-one – and I mean taxpayers – realises; but it is by opening up the markets, much more than by granting aid, that we can give hundreds of millions of people real, lasting opportunities to escape from hunger and poverty and lay the structural foundations, including legal foundations, for economic growth, and civil growth too, in a spirit of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the European Union – and this is why I am happy to listen to the Commissioner – is not doing enough, it has to be said; it is going through the motions with the United States, but it is not doing enough: it did not do enough in Doha and it is not doing enough in the proposal on what are known as the modalities for the negotiating round concerning trade in agricultural products, which will follow Doha, maintaining excessively high protection levels and still including tariffs which will be reduced too far in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is a compromise resolution, and it is showing the consequences of this: suffice it to say that the operative part contains 27 items. That is to say it sets out the sum total of human knowledge on world hunger, AIDS, poverty and so on. It retains some important points, in particular the Commission’s request to step up the implementation of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative by the end of 2003. We have been striving, commendably, to liberalise our markets in all products, except arms, for the world’s 48 poorest countries, but we have said that for three basic products – bananas, rice and sugar – we will delay abolishing duties until 2009. If abolishing duties has a purpose – and it does – in the fight against poverty, then please let us do it now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, however, no reason to close our eyes to the fact that there are still real famines in large parts of the world today, especially in Africa. I therefore very much welcome the fact that Parliament is once again drawing attention to this catastrophic situation and backing strategies to fight it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, food aid to areas in crisis is too little in itself for a sustainable strategy. Thought must be given to many different factors, and these include structural causes in the developing countries, such as access to land and water, just as much as the need to increase logistical capacities and the existence of suitable infrastructures. Building up capacities that will help people to help themselves must be regarded as a key element.</p>
<p class="contents">The unconditional opening of the European Union’s agricultural markets, which is called for by many, is not the only panacea for conquering hunger in the developing countries. Stable prices are important for farmers in the South as in the North. Rather, I see support for the building of national and regional markets as a practicable way of reducing these countries’ dependence on the industrialised nations. Mr President, we must continue to pursue a sustainable interregional strategy that puts the needs of the population to the fore.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would also like to stress that the transfer of technology and know-how in the field of agriculture is extremely important if a sustainable agriculture is to be achieved that not only produces for world trade but first and foremost supplies its own population with produce. At the same time, however, we must help the developing countries to meet the EU’s important food safety standards by taking public and plant health measures. In this connection, strategies will have to be devised to encourage private sector investment and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to expressly say that a great deal of attention needs to be paid to preventing fraud particularly in connection with development aid. Farmers in rural areas in both North and South must not be the losers, because they provide our food and are the basis of all social needs and the guarantors of sustainable development. I am very pleased that we have found so broad a consensus here in this joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately this proposal was seriously toned down for rice and sugar at the time and was postponed following pressure by the European sugar industry and sugar-producing countries. It is still important to realise that a country like Mozambique, which was completely dependent on food from elsewhere as a result of an endless civil war, is now able to provide her own food thanks to good internal distribution. This has to do with the construction of water systems, good environmental management and the participation of local farmers. With external help, the local systems were repaired after the floods. In short, a success story.</p>
<p class="contents">The link with European agricultural protectionism is nevertheless very distressing in this case as well. Under normal circumstances, Mozambique would earn as much from her sugar production on the world market as she now receives in international aid. The situation is not normal, however, as consumer prices are artificially high in Europe, and are therefore ruining the world market. This naturally requires a restructuring of our industry, including a social plan. Our refusal to break through our protectionism structurally undermines poor countries’ own food supplies. It is complete lunacy if the final stage in this vicious circle of hunger consists of dumping our surpluses on the markets we have already undermined through low world market prices. We must continue to buy from the regions themselves as an absolute priority, even if the price is slightly higher.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, our proposals to turn Doha into a development round require more than the current Commission proposals. The Commission has proposed cutting export subsidies by 45%, but in Doha we were talking about abolition. Forty-five per cent is only a start, and things must go a lot faster. A one-third cut in tariffs is not enough either, and the Commission’s proposal to get tariffs on agricultural imports from developing countries down to zero must go further than just half of these imports. This is of great importance when it comes to bridging the gap between the developed and the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that good governance, a good regional agricultural policy that does not throw everything into exports but concentrates first on local self-sufficiency coupled with regional trade, are likewise indispensable. The help of the EU is very important in this regard. Europe now gives with the one hand and takes away with the other. Protectionism. It is high time Europe started making a difference and really started cooperating with these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fight against poverty and food insecurity and the prevention of the conflicts which often result from them must target the structural causes and must break away from economic, agricultural and trade policies which are now bankrupt. The main economic obstacles preventing the food needs of billions of human beings from being met are well known: the obligation to sell at prices that are lower than production costs, the way in which farmers in those countries are more or less forced to concentrate on export products that are useful to the countries of the North rather than necessary to the people of the South, and the liberalisation of trade carried out by international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO, thereby depriving individual countries of the right to define their own policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could decide to set about solving these problems. Unfortunately, I am afraid that the method it has chosen is once again not the right one. The UNDP report for 2002 reminds us that if the process continues at the present snail’s pace, it will take more than 130 years to abolish hunger. World hunger requires more than an urgent appeal by rich countries to poor countries, asking them to fall in with the laws laid down by the WTO. When 60% of the people of Zambia need food aid, and when the multinationals, Monsanto and DuPont, control 93% of its seed market between them, more than short-sighted and short-term private investment is needed. When commercial trade worldwide represents 7 000 billion US dollars a year, when financial transactions amount to 1 500 billion US dollars a day, and when the World Bank itself considers it necessary to double world development aid which has reached a ceiling of 50 billion US dollars a year, when is there going to be a useful tax levied on international financial transactions in order to finance that aid? This is where the intervention of the European Union could be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against poverty makes it essential for the developing countries to gain the right to fix their own priorities and strategies in order to support sustainable food production by utilising their own natural and human resources and local know-how and investing in the structural transformation of their economies, at the same time receiving legitimate, guaranteed prices. Free-trade agreements concluded between parties which are not on a level playing ground and which are based on the abolition of customs tariffs regardless of the level of development of each party have exacerbated poverty and have had a negative impact on food security. There is an urgent need to encourage the local production of food crops by encouraging access to land, water and biodiversity resources. There is also an urgent need to cancel the debts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt some truth in that, but trade does not fill stomachs. Trade does not make people rich, either, ladies and gentlemen, at any rate not always both sides. We must therefore ask how we trade. If we are speaking of the debts of developing world countries, then the reason for those debts is unequal trade.</p>
<p class="contents">If we talk about people being hungry, we have to see that 80% of the hungry live in rural areas. How are the hungry to export food to Europe when they have nothing to eat themselves? We must ask who trades with Europe, in what goods and on what terms? If we are trading and importing unprocessed foodstuffs that are then processed here and shipped back with export subsidies – which again distorts the terms of trade – that cannot help to solve the problem of hunger. Europe is the biggest importer of food. If we are asking how we can change the balance of trade in favour of the countries of the developing world, the only way is to pay for those products according to European terms. Then we shall see economies developing.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, we say we will exploit these countries with low prices, then we will destroy rural agriculture both here and there. We must also see to it that land is made available to the people in these countries. Land – in the sense of a class struggle – is not the whole of the problem, however; we must also ask the following questions: Who can work that land? Who will take responsibility for it? Who will teach the people how to work the land? Who will allow people who are still in a subsistence economy to continue working in that subsistence economy and support them so they can pass their knowledge on to subsequent generations? We ought to be addressing these questions and stop thinking we can help these people fill their stomachs simply by opening the borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By the time it takes to discuss this topic, almost one thousand people will have died of hunger somewhere in the world – the majority of them in Africa. At the present time, there are about 800 million people in the world who do not have enough food and this includes 300 million children.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the most frightening aspect of all of this is that the situation is not improving. On the contrary, over the past decade, the gap between rich and poor, between the 'haves' and the 'have nots', between the well fed and the hungry has grown even wider.</p>
<p class="contents">We, who are fortunate enough to be born into a part of the world where there are no food shortages, drought or famine, have a moral responsibility to work towards a more just world. I do not refer simply to food aid. I accept that the EU is the world's largest donor of development aid. We need to look at the root causes of poverty and hunger so these can be tackled and thereby eliminated in the long-term.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of creating a fair trading system, the EU has made a significant contribution with its ‘everything but arms’ initiative. We have committed ourselves to fully eliminating the customs duties applied to the export of the world's 48 poorest countries. I would certainly hope those parts of the rich world that still maintain such barriers will be strongly urged by the Commission to adopt a policy such as we have done here within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, there are many parts of the world today that are not self-sufficient, and we who have developed the techniques must share our technologies and our experiences with developing countries. There are many excellent examples of the positive and successful work of the NGOs for example and other voluntary agencies in this challenging area and, in my view, this work must be fully supported into the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet three quarters of those people are rural people, in other words the very people whose job it is to provide not only their own food but also that of their fellow citizens. Those 600 million poor farmers are not in a position to feed themselves or to feed others like them because they are the direct victims of the lowering of farm prices dictated by trade liberalisation. All they can do is to cut off their internal-consumption reserves permanently in order to try and save, more often than not without success, their production potential.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we release them from this vicious circle? We can do so by adopting a new approach to the globalisation of trade in agricultural and food products, at the heart of which should lie the recognition of the principle of food sovereignty. According to this principle, each country or group of countries should be free to determine how it supplies its people with food. Food sovereignty means the recognition of people’s right to feed themselves and their right to feed themselves as they want to. It means the opportunity for developing countries to achieve food autonomy by developing their agriculture. It is not enough to declare that developing countries have the right to develop their food crops: it is also essential that the rules governing international trade in agricultural products do not prohibit them from doing so in practice. We must have clearer recognition of the fact that these countries have the right to protect their farmers and to open up their markets selectively, as Europe itself did in order to end its food dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries which have been most successful in reducing famine are those where responsible governments have been able, thanks to policies which support farm prices and subsidies paid for those setting up in farming and for infrastructures, to allow their farmers to have access to their own internal markets, thereby increasing their purchasing power and their productivity, and consequently their production. If we want to tackle the problem of hunger seriously, therefore, it is urgently necessary to stop reducing agricultural prices: access for peasant farmers to a profitable local market is the first requirement for the growth of agricultural production, which is itself the key to reducing hunger. The total and uncontrolled liberalisation of trade in agricultural products is not in the interests of hungry countries; it is in the interests of countries which are structurally exporters of agricultural products, but it ruins poor farmers in developing countries. There is no sense in trying to have direct competition between the small farmer in Chad and the big farmer in Minnesota, or between the shepherds of the Andes and the latifundia of New Zealand.</p>
<p class="contents">If, then, the European Union wants to make an effective contribution to reducing hunger in the world, it will have to be particularly vigilant with regard to three essential points. Firstly, the agricultural development programmes that it is financing in the developing countries will all have to include a section that provides aid for the marketing of food products. Secondly, the European Union will have to assist the developing countries or groups of countries which have similar production costs to protect their internal markets against world-market dumping prices, with the aid of instruments without which their producers will be ruined. Thirdly, the European Union will also, at last, have to use all its influence in international trade negotiations, so as to ensure the recognition of the right to agricultural exemption, in other words the right of nations to protect their farmers, who feed them and whose prosperity governs their development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, in addition to the numbers that have already been mentioned on hunger and malnutrition, to provide some others that I think are worth bearing in mind: 1% of the population owns 57% of the world’s wealth; more than 2.5 billion people have no access to drinking water; more than 2 billion people have no electricity; more than 1 billion live in extreme poverty; and 70% of those infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. It was therefore extremely positive that, given the tragedy of these figures, the Johannesburg Summit made, for the first time, a very close link between the eradication of poverty and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This summit should lead us to draw lessons for the EU’s internal policies. The EU delegation was actually the only one to set out for Johannesburg with a negotiating agenda, which became the Conference’s sole agenda. It was also largely due to the action of the EU that some positive results were achieved at the summit, such as targets for eradicating poverty and for promoting access to drinking water and sanitation. It was also due to the EU’s work that a large number of partnerships between the public and private sectors were agreed on, specifically in the field of water and energy and that a ten-year plan was adopted for sustainable production and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true, however, that it was the deep-seated differences between the European Union and the developing countries, especially in the trade and finance dossier, that prevented more far-reaching results from being achieved. In practice, it became clear that the poorest countries are not prepared to concede ground with regard to biodiversity, renewable energies and governance, whilst the United States and the European Union are clinging on to a model of subsidies for their products in agriculture, fisheries and fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, if we wish to be credible partners of the developing countries and if we wish to narrow this shocking divide in well-being between North and South, we must fulfil our promises on financing, on relieving the debt of the poorest countries and also on gradually eliminating our subsidies to farming, fisheries and energy and of course on eliminating trade barriers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to focus this morning particularly on the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations which are now taking place between the EU and the ACP. 40 out of the 78 ACP countries are least-developed countries, 38 have very serious levels of poverty and several others are particularly vulnerable as small island and land-locked states. As you are well aware Commissioner, the ACP perceive these negotiations as involving not just the pursuit of neo-liberal ideologies in respect of trade but the importance, in addition, of having a clear understanding that the economic partnership agreement negotiations are as much about development as about the promotion of trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The structural transformation of ACP states into competitive economies capable of exploiting the opportunities which the relationship with Europe offers will require, as I know you acknowledged to us in the committee last week, a huge investment in capacity building, particularly in trade capacity building. I know there is an investment being made in that area now, but I would urge you, Commissioner, to monitor that very closely because I suspect that, as the negotiations go on, it will be necessary to devote extra resources to the ability of the ACP to deal with the regional trade arrangements and other aspects of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there are severe supply-side restraints that they face as well. Eastern European countries are receiving billions of euros to upgrade food-processing standards before they join the EU. You know very well that the ACP will have great difficulty in meeting the phytosanitary and sanitary conditions that will be a necessary part of the future relationship. I trust that they will get at least as much support for their efforts to upgrade the processes that they have.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, Commissioner, you are aware of the potential cost of reciprocity and the fact that, under their economic partnership agreement, the same level of commitment will be expected from the ACP as from the European side. I hope that you will take into account the difficulties that this will cause and that you will ensure that there are rigorous impact studies of the costs and the implications of reciprocity for ACP countries.</p>

Apart from the figures, though, I think that we should be shocked by the trend revealed by these statistics: this population which potentially has a death sentence hanging over it, despite the efforts of mankind, continues to grow. According to the statistics, it has more than doubled in the last 30 years, and this is what should really concern us. Furthermore, in addition to these people, to those who are in danger of dying from starvation and malnutrition, that is it seems, more than 30 million in Africa and 800 million in Latin – central and south – America, there are the millions of AIDS victims who each day truly represent a historic blot on the conscience of global society, which is unable to provide the necessary amount of resources during aid interventions and which is unable, above all, to make pharmaceutical multinationals forego patent fees and royalties<span class="italic">, </span>at least for emergency products.</p>
<p class="contents">This endemic situation of poverty, hunger and disease is accentuated by the acute economic and social crises which have trapped these countries in a downward spiral from which there is no escape. The undertaking by governments and private parties to making these countries self-sufficient no longer suffices, and is barely coping with circumstances, with the daily emergency. The economies therefore contract under the burden of public and international debts. In order to tackle this emergency, as we know, the European Union has opened up its markets – in addition to expressing its solidarity – and has granted direct aid, but it is not enough: the efforts of many governments to limit or cancel debts incurred in the past by these countries does not yet go far enough. In this connection, I would like to point out a development which has been overlooked to a large degree: during the G8 Summit in Genoa in July 2001, at the initiative of the Italian Government, the summit of the most developed countries was preceded by a meeting with a large group of representatives from countries with public debt, starvation and poverty problems. Well, this was not a merely symbolic or ritual gesture: that day, almost a third of the large, huge public debt of these countries was discharged. Unfortunately, this result went unnoticed because of the rioting in the streets which attracted all the mass media’s attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say a few words, in these appalling circumstances, on the valuable, irreplaceable role of the NGOs in all the Community and non-Community countries, which have always been on the front line in this war against starvation and death from malnutrition and AIDS. The Commission really must substantially boost programmes devoted to them. It must be said that, by themselves, these volunteers are achieving measures which are of a much higher quality and is much more convincing than those of all the western governments, and, above all, that they manage to put much more enthusiasm into this work, providing resources and solidarity, firm in the belief, Mr President, that no-one can feel free and happy if the others around them are not free and happy too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, others have spoken about rich and poor countries, about the prosperity we have in Europe and the quite contrasting conditions in lesser-developed countries. Mr Bautista Ojeda was speaking about that just a moment ago. As Europe today revels in its economic success and prosperity, we need to consider at what expense it has been to other parts of the world, and the consequences for these counties.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of our success and prosperity today is the result of our policies of the last and the nineteenth century when imperialism went to other countries around the world, and we are now reaping the consequences. We can do far more about this than we are actually doing at the moment. The difficulties manifest themselves today in Europe in the pressure for people from less developed countries wanting to migrate to Europe, and in people fleeing from some of the countries that are so desperate not just because of their economic situation, but also their lack of democracy and violence, and seeking asylum in the west. We can do more by helping those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just about huge amounts of development money; the aid needs to be sustainable. One thing that we can do to help those countries would be to look again at our common agricultural policy – looking to reform that. At the moment, we are dumping subsidised goods on lesser-developed countries, which does not help their community, economy or farmers at all. We protect our own agricultural community in Europe at the cost of other countries. Whilst we are subsidising our agriculture, farmers and poorer people in countries all around the world are going under because they are unable to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must look at the common agricultural policy. We must work with the WTO to make sure that the standards and the conditions that they set do not contribute to poverty. We can do more then we are doing at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, it would help if crop yields were higher – but this is not, I repeat, not the essence of the hunger problem. Free and in particular fair trade also helps, but that is not the essence either. The essence is the distribution problem. There is no hunger in countries with a parliamentary democracy, even if they are poor countries. The political rulers know that they can be voted out. With political dictatorships it is different. Take Zimbabwe, for example. The link between democracy and the absence of hunger was established by no less a person than Amartya Sen, the winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, from India. The best solution is the promotion of democracy throughout the world. This aspect is too often lacking in the European strategy.</p>

Removing the barriers to trade on products from developing countries on the part of the EU has not visibly improved the situation in third countries, although the EU is the largest export market for agricultural products from the developing countries. One drawback of the European Union’s policy on developing countries has been the promotion in many places of autonomous production in those countries. At the same time the export of heavily subsidised European agricultural products is harming or destroying local production.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides removing barriers to trade we also have to promote the spread of fair trade products in the Union. The Commission has supported information campaigns for fair trade products, but at the same time has said their high prices will only fall if demand for them grows. The EU should calculate the threshold price for fair trade products and raise the threshold prices for other products from developing countries. A drop in fair trade threshold prices would help them to sell in the EU. That in turn would increase the volume of production in the developing countries. Then production would move more in the direction of fair trade. At the same time the Developing Countries Fund should be used to support in particular the farms that go over to operating under the fair trade sign. Low-interest loans and development aid should be granted to develop these farms so as to organise training and education programmes for those who are left jobless, especially women.</p>
<p class="contents">We make donations and organise collections to prevent famine, but often forget that it is we who cause those famines with the import duties we impose. Member States should also favour fair trade products in public procurement, with increasing demand resulting in lower costs and lower retail prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Global crop production cannot be increased by making the amount of land available for cultivation greater. Scarcer water resources also have an impact. Increased large-scale irrigation is no longer possible. If food production cannot be increased we must change the basis for its distribution as well as our trading relations. Apart from the uneven distribution of food, one of the reasons for famine that might be mentioned is often an unstable political situation. At present the seriousness of the famine in Sub-Saharan Africa is specifically due to the fact that conventional humanitarian aid can no longer be used to prevent a catastrophe owing to political instability in the region. The capacity of governments for confronting this crisis is totally non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">Famine must be averted through social remedies as well as political and economic ones. Often it is mainly women who suffer from famine. Although women produce more than half the world’s food, according to an estimate by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, they nevertheless have the poorest prospects of owning land, being granted credit, studying and enjoying their social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s political groups have drafted a joint motion for a resolution on the statement by the Commission. There is therefore very firm political backing for aid for the victims of famine and for financial support for the developing countries. This should also be visible in the policies of the Commission and the Council. My worst fear is that once again in issues relating to the developing countries there will be fewer deeds than words. That must not be. Behind theoretical speech there is a whole real world. They are real people, not dummies. They have a pain threshold. This must not be forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The famine and malnutrition which we are protesting about here are not the result of the earth’s inability to feed its inhabitants, but rather the result of specific political situations, and even of a certain number of international policies for which we share part of the responsibility. Sometimes these may be local political situations – war, the collapse of government, the murderous madness of groups of individuals or of leaders – but they may also be the effects of international policies. Some of these have already been mentioned: debt, the size of our agricultural subsidies which are ruining farmers in the countries of the South, the fact that in many developing countries the farming industry and the economy are oriented first and foremost towards exporting certain products, certain raw materials, resulting in a monoculture which is contrary to the objectives of food self-sufficiency and food security, which require agricultural diversification. This is why I agree with what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said just now, to the effect that access to the markets of the North, to our markets, is extremely important, but it is also only an extremely partial view. I believe that strict monitoring is essential in order to ensure that regional integration, economic diversification and food security can be guaranteed in these developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us have just come back from Porto Alegre. President Lula’s victory and the policy that he wants to pursue, particularly against hunger, have given rise to an enormous feeling of hope: in Brazil, in Latin America generally and, beyond that, in all developing countries. If this policy produces results, it will open up new prospects not only for development but also for hopes of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we going to do to support Brazil, to help it to make this experiment a success? In the IMF, are we going to continue to require these countries to achieve an annual surplus of 3.75%, while at the same time maintaining that a 3% maximum deficit as part of the Stability Pact is rigid and stupid? We have a problem with consistency here. Moreover, at the same time as you are trying to encourage Member States of the Union to increase development aid, within the international bodies – we could quote the WTO as an example here – policies are being pursued which in some cases are preventing these objectives from being achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, President Lula launched an appeal, at Porto Alegre and at Davos, for the creation of a major worldwide fund to combat hunger and poverty. Are we going to support him? Are we going to propose – or rather is the Commission going to propose to the Council and to Parliament – a tax on the wealth created by globalisation, which could be used to supply this fund, which would be managed by the United Nations? That would be a practical response and a strong political signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The official statements, all of which have been quoted in today’s resolution, must now be followed up with further, and very definite, measures. There is no doubt a great variety of ways out of the poverty trap in the less developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the European Parliament’s ACP delegation, the removal of barriers to trade with the poorest countries concerns me greatly. The number of people in the developing countries who have less than one dollar a day to live on continues to grow. Across the world, 900 people die of hunger every hour, many of them children. Deep public concern has long since ceased to be enough. The European Union and other donors must respond more vigorously to hunger in the developing countries, increase food and humanitarian aid and distribute the money provided, from the HIV/AIDS fund, for example, more quickly. Road tolls, import and customs procedures, and so on, in the areas at risk, mean that logistical capacity is not sufficient to ensure that food aid is delivered on time and without a hitch.</p>
<p class="contents">We here in the European Parliament should, by means of today’s resolution, make clear once again that the worldwide costs of failure to abolish hunger are enormously high. Wars, repeated disasters, international crime, drug dealing, economic stagnation, illegal immigration and premature death, ladies and gentlemen, are but a few among them. Of course, the decision to admit all products – with the exception of arms – from the least developed countries to the European Union market is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have almost finished. Of course we must improve market access for agricultural products from the developing countries. But we should also point out that other highly developed countries in this world really must make greater efforts too. As a member of the ACP delegation I support the work of this resolution as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many maintain that globalisation is the root cause of the state of the economy in the poorest countries. The truth is that the North’s protectionist policy has helped to strangle crucial sectors in the South. The contention that poor countries can achieve the same levels of income as rich countries without international trade, without incoming capital and investment, is quite simply nonsense. If the poor countries make do with what is in their coffers or wait to develop their own technological capabilities, it will take them forever.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no such thing as true progress in a society where few become richer and many become poorer. Hunger and abject poverty mainly affect women, making sexual inequality a huge barrier to development. Over the last decade, the number of women living in absolute poverty has risen. This is linked to reproductive health problems, because it is the poorest women that have the least access to health services and the most unwanted babies. Nearly all of the half a million women who die from maternity-related causes live in the underdeveloped world and they die, not because they decided to become mothers, but because they are poor. The probability of a woman dying in these circumstances is less than one in three thousand in the developed world, compared to one in nineteen in Africa. These figures prove that the benefits of globalisation have still not reached that many people. Continuing poverty is holding back this process through open trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The only solution is to overcome our two main enemies: the resistance of numerous political leaders in the North, who refuse to tear down barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and the resistance of numerous political leaders in the South, who refuse to give their people basic political, economic and human rights, without which there can be no development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the way you have handled my unfortunate problems getting here this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would start by saying that I find it both important and remarkable that across party lines everybody is basically in agreement in describing the problem and in pointing out what needs to be done. This is important, even though one Member did remark that I might not be the right Commissioner to deal with this debate considering the kind of problems that are involved, and in particular the trade issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we all have to face the reality that coherence starts at home. In the Commission we have achieved a much better situation in terms of working across different sectoral views and lines, and concerning the balance between the global issues of development and trade today I am convinced that this Commission is working in a much more organised and predictable way, and reflecting more basic orientations, than previous Commissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Parliament itself should do more to ensure that the nice, correct analysis presented by all parties here is representative of the whole House. The dark forces of agriculture in Europe are not only working in certain governments. This game is also going on in this House. If we talk about fisheries, farm policy, agricultural reform in Europe, the acceptance of whether or not ‘everything but arms’ should be subject to the modifications concerning sugar, rice and bananas, all this would be lacking in impact if everybody thinks this is only a task for the Commission. We all have a responsibility. Much as I welcome everything I have heard, and I am sure what I did not hear was of the same genre, and appreciate your encouragement, it would be more in terms of Realpolitik to return that message to Parliament itself and ask for a partnership that delivers these attitudes also on those policy areas where we have difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, I share the analysis. A few remarks concerning figures: at the World Food Summit last spring, I offered the analysis that approximately 80% of the people who are really starving in the world do so because of conflicts. The problem of food insecurity or the inadequate mix or quality of the food is bigger than the number of people who are, in that sense, really starving.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that all these problems are directly linked to poverty. I have just returned from a week in Zambia and Angola, and in Zambia in particular we were able to have a close look at the reality on the ground, visiting food distribution centres and support services for subsistence farmers and so on. Everything that has been said here about the relation to trade policy, access to our markets and the need to diversify agricultural production and the economy in these countries is true, but it is also true that there is a sort of de-linkage from all this affecting the very poor subsistence farmers. They are not anywhere near a monetarised economy and do not have anything interesting to offer in terms of cash crops. They do not get services as such. This is the hard-core category of poverty and it is their food insecurity that really creates the picture we are trying to do something about in the current crisis in the Horn of Africa. This is a long-term structural effect showing that neglect, poverty and marginalisation are the real problems.</p>
<p class="contents">More trade, the big global discussion, does not immediately help these people. It is another layer, so to speak. Now what we are trying to do in the southern African food crisis makes a lot of sense compared to those simply dumping surplus maize, a sort of opportunistic marketing if you will, into those countries. So far, and this is a figure we can be proud of, 99.1% of what the European Commission has been providing in the southern African food crisis has been bought in the region. This makes sense. In fact, we are performing the role of a catalyst to develop a market in the region, to give the right signal to producers, those producers who participate in the monetarised formal economy, who produce for a market and not just for themselves and the neighbour, if he is even worse off.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a de-linkage between those actually playing in a market as agricultural producers and those simply feeding themselves, if they can. The main problem is the marginalised, very poor group who cannot survive if there is more than one year of bad rain because then they cannot prepare the next season.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of money and resources, this is not very challenging or problematic. The big problem is to move them into something that reaches somewhat outside their own non-monetarised subsistence economy. The discussion on ‘everything but arms’ should be continued in the manner we are doing today. Of course, we are not at the end of these discussions in the Doha track and I would strongly urge Parliament to keep up the pressure and input that I have heard today. A lot of work needs to be done before we can aspire to earning the headline of being a development round.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Souchet I would say that the food sovereignty notion makes a lot of sense but sufficiency is not the only way to do it. Singapore, for instance, is not self-sufficient in food production, which shows that there are other possibilities, but for the category of countries we are talking about here I have to agree totally that this is a good way of defining the challenge at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">But to say that protectionism and the right to subsidise agricultural production is a good idea is something I would warn against. It is more important to open up between neighbours, also in this area. Any way of stimulating the emergence of market mechanisms regionally is a key to getting things rolling. Mrs Kinnock's remarks about the economic partnership agreement negotiations highlighted the need to make our ACP partners more aware of their responsibility in moving this agenda forward. The phytosanitary constraints, and different elements such as capacity building on trade negotiation, are not really a problem in terms of money made available. The real problem is to define adequate, good, specific fundable projects and ideas. For phytosanitary standards in fisheries we also have ongoing large programmes. We are pushing to have a central help-desk organised in the Commission to which all problems can be directly channelled so we can fight the battle for a decent reaction in the Commission. We hope to see a flow of ideas from the reality out there which can materialise in fundable actions. That is the architecture of how we would like to accelerate what we do here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Santini said that NGOs did more than all the western governments together. I agree that NGOs are extremely important, especially in the area of humanitarian aid but also generally. But please do not shield the public from the raw information that, when we add all the different budget lines together, the Commission is channelling about EUR 1 billion annually through NGOs. They sometimes have great difficulty, and are extremely shy, in telling the public how they are funded. When MSF received their well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize, I sent them a telegram of congratulations in which I also told them that, as the provider of about 50% of their economic basis, I felt entitled to extend even warmer congratulations to them, and would also hope that our partnership could be reflected in the way in which MSF present themselves to the public. Unfortunately, I never even received an answer. That does not change our relationship but I urge Parliament to help me insist on some reality when it comes to visibility. It is difficult for our own public to understand what the money is really used for when it is shielded in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">One remark for Mrs Schierhuber, who said that fraud in development aid is a problem. It is reckless for me to say no, but most corruption and fraud has to do with fat contracts, with management or mismanagement of oil revenue, diamonds, illegal logging and other heavy stuff. In the case of our development cooperation work, it is not that big a problem. I admit that, technically, fundability is here to stay, as it provides more flexibility in the budget. That being said, our general track record and ability to trace and document is quite good.</p>
<p class="contents">You remember when the Ivory Coast was playing around with money and the hammer fell. They paid back and that is how the piano plays. I should like to dispel the notion that development cooperation in itself is a problem, as this is not the case. It is also why following and delivering on Monterrey is important. We have reach the point as regards the quality and handling of development cooperation where it is meaningful, in fighting poverty to say that more of the same is right. Finally, I should like to say to Mr Santini that if Italy were to move from the previous and current level of 0.15% of GDP for development assistance to the 0.33% in 2006 called for in the Monterrey decision, such a contribution on the part of Italy and other Member States below the current average of EU partners would make the most interesting and relevant response to the discussion here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aid organisations have been warning of a large-scale disaster since September. The fact that even this Parliament is only paying attention to this five months later says a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am pleased about this resolution. In addition to the immediate cause – drought and war – it also looked at the deeper causes: poverty, the high customs tariffs on products from the poorest countries, the burden of debt, the AIDS epidemic and the agricultural subsidies in the West.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two thoughts on the issue. The rich countries must naturally come up with resources to relieve the distress more quickly and more generously. This food aid, however, must not be used as a political tool by regimes like that in Zimbabwe so that they can shirk their responsibilities and perpetuate their power. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, starvation must not be used as an excuse to push genetically modified food. In the European Union, the approval of GMOs is subject to stringent requirements, and rightly so. In Africa, the uncontrolled dumping of GMOs could have far-reaching consequences, in particular for the environment, agriculture and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the milling of genetically modified grain is not a watertight solution. In Zimbabwe, the stores were plundered as soon as the food arrived.</p>
<p class="contents">The assertion that there is not enough non-GM food available is not correct. India has 65 million tonnes of grain available immediately. </p>
<p class="contents">During the Cold War, food aid was used as a political and commercial weapon. We must not allow it to be used today to create a market for Western biotech companies, so enabling such companies permanently to bind farmers in developing countries to themselves.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
