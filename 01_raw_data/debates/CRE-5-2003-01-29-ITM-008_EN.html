<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Madam President, the proposal now before us is the second of three directives that aim to bring legislation in the Member States in line with the Århus Convention. Just as with the first directive on access to environmental information, the third reading has now taken into account the result of conciliation, which represents Parliament’s position very clearly, and which meets the minimum requirement in the Århus Convention fully and even goes beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council adopted many elements from Parliament’s first reading in its common position, in the same way that Parliament was able to adopt many elements from the common position. We thus set out to achieve conciliation with considerably fewer problems than there were with regard to the first pillar. On the other hand, just these few issues caused huge problems, owing to differences in approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal and the Council’s common position are rooted in the ‘quick fix’ principle, while Parliament had hoped for a broader, horizontal approach. Obviously, however, it is not Parliament’s aim to defend its position to the letter, but instead ensure that there are no grey areas left in EU legislation where public participation would be justified but impossible owing to some blunder on the part of a legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">During conciliation we were able to find a two-stage solution to the problem. On the one hand, the requirements concerning public participation in line with the Århus Convention are to be included in new Community legislation from the outset. On the other hand, existing legislation and the field covered by the directive are to be reviewed on the basis of the experience gained during the first six years of its application.</p>
<p class="contents">During conciliation the Member States undertook to promote practical opportunities for public participation. Authorities will be encouraged, for example, to inform the public about decisions taken, and the reasons and considerations upon which they are based, and public participation processes. The time limits for participation in decision-making at the various stages must be reasonable, so that the public can prepare and participate in decision-making effectively. In addition, authorities will be encouraged to promote environmental education of the public, which will also undoubtedly be in the authorities’ own interests, in that the extent to which people participate effectively can only improve through education.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of public participation in the updating of permits was of particular significance. The parties involved in the conciliation process wanted to find the right balance in this matter. On the one hand, the public could genuinely participate when it is vitally important to check the operating permits of installations and factories, such as when there is a danger of an increase in the amount of environmental harm being done. On the other hand, an authority could check permits without any public participation when implementing acts and regulations where it is genuinely not a matter of discretion. I think we have succeeded here: the public can participate when decisions on the environment are actually being made, but the importance of a precious instrument for participation is not being inflated by asking the public to participate in routine decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">What was for Parliament an important victory in principle, albeit small in scope I suppose, was when during conciliation a process for exclusions relating to national defence projects was adopted. In accordance with the Århus Convention, projects relating to national defence may be excluded from the scope of the directive only on the basis of case-by-case decisions by the Member States’ authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">After decisions are taken following public participation the public must naturally be able to evaluate them. In conciliation we arrived at a solution that is satisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned. The public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is to be endorsed and the authorities required to provide the public with practical information, if required, about access to administrative and judicial review procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be mentioned in particular that, in order to ensure the result of the conciliation procedure does have an effect, the Commission has undertaken, in a statement to be annexed to the directive, to submit in the first quarter of 2003 a proposal for a directive concerning the implementation of the Århus Convention as regards access to justice in environmental matters. We can therefore be confident that the ratification process of the Århus Convention on the whole will make headway in the Community without undue delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and especially Denmark, the country that held the presidency, now transferred to Greece, for their excellent levels of cooperation during conciliation and in the unofficial discussions that preceded it. I heartily recommend that Parliament endorse the results of the conciliation procedure in tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It supplements the Directive on environmental information. With it, the EU is taking a step closer to the implementation of the Århus Convention. The principles of the Århus Convention are very important, because the environment does not have its own vote, so to speak. Decision-making on environmental matters must, therefore, be open and transparent if we are to afford the environment sufficient protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of this directive covers fundamental requirements for public participation in decision-making on the environment. This directive establishes a necessary common framework that also covers matters with a cross-border dimension. The details are left in the hands of the Member States, however. This is important, because public participation must be at the heart of all levels of administration, and the forms it takes must be adapted to decision-making at the various levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive covers, on the one hand, important plans and programmes to be drawn up in accordance with our environmental legislation, and, on the other hand, decisions on activities that can have a significant impact on the environment. These activities are covered by the Directive on environmental impact assessment and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control. These two directives are now being supplemented with provisions on public participation and access to justice in accordance with the Århus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">By ‘public participation’ the directive means that the public must be informed about the activities in question and its own right to participate. The section of the public affected is to have the right to comment on a matter at an early stage. Lastly, public bodies are to take due account of the outcome of public participation when making decisions and make their decisions known. The directive also contains provisions on reviewing the legality of decisions that fall within the scope of the provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should of course like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, for her intensive work on the directive, and express my gratitude to her and to the members of Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee for the efforts they have made towards reaching this agreement, which has made it possible for us to adopt this important act tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely in the area of the environment that people’s dissatisfaction has been most deeply felt. We are all aware of cases in which, when confronted with certain projects or installations, the citizens feel compelled to express their right to be indignant in the streets or in the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds. It was therefore very important that, in the wake of the Aarhus Convention, the Commission has legislated on public participation and public access to information. I therefore congratulate the Commissioner for the Environment. Greater public participation will not only give greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions but also enhance the quality of these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive on public participation in drawing up certain environmental plans and programmes is a good example of how the citizens’ participation in politics can be made more democratic. I also congratulate our rapporteur on the work she has done in Parliament and also in the Conciliation Committee. I should like to highlight three main results of this Conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the fact that NGOs should participate fully in the debate on access to information in this process; secondly, the fact that all Community legislation has to explicitly define conditions for public participation; and thirdly the mandatory participation of the public in cases considered to be significant. Lastly, I welcome the announcement made by the Commissioner that we will have legislation on citizens’ access to justice before the end of 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of the directive is to harmonise Community legislation with the Århus Convention. It has already been said here that the directive will fully entitle the public to participate in the decision-making process right from the start, especially as regards planning and the implementation of programmes, the environmental impact evaluation process, the prevention of pollution, and the reduction in pollutants in general. It will also allow the decision-makers to take the views and concerns of the public into account when making decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">This will obviously and quite properly increase the transparency of the decision-making process and help to increase public interest in, and knowledge about, environmental issues. The requirements concerning public participation in line with the Århus Convention are to be included in future in relevant Community legislation from the outset. It is also important that authorities should also inform the public about the reasons for their decisions to a much greater extent. It is important in general too that on many points it is required that the information given is supplied in language that is clear and that the authorities help the public to understand the information that is available.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also good that public participation is to increase in the most important areas of all, that the public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is being endorsed, and, once again, that authorities will be required to provide correct, clear and explicit information. On this basis I believe we can expect the public’s inclination to have an influence on environmental issues to grow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are now faced with something more, something different, and that is positive. Indeed, what is happening through this process? We hope that the impetus to act – starting before the moment of decision-making – will come via those who are closest to the region, to the town, to the environment, and that it will then be taken up, transformed and handed back down in the form of guidelines, requirements and, if necessary, constraints, regulated through these rules by those with the authority to do so. Basically, we must give the citizens the ability to act in a sector which does, indeed, concern them, which concerns even those who do not want to be involved, for the consequences of environmental damage affect the citizens first and foremost.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out, in conclusion, that it will not, however, be at all easy to harmonise the different national laws with European requirements and directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
