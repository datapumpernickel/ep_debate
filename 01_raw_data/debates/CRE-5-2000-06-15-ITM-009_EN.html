<p class="contents"><span class="bold">- Schmitt Report (A5-0123)</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span> – (<span class="italic">FR</span>) President, the Commission working document ‘Towards common standards on asylum procedures’ is a short, fairly general text which, according to the introduction, is designed to launch a discussion following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty which, in its new Article 63, once again provides for the adoption of a whole series of joint European standards applicable to refugees and displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">We have good reason to be surprised at this introduction to the subject. Why launch a discussion? We had thought, quite logically, that all the discussions had taken place before the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and that the federalists knew where they were going.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, on reading the Commission document and the report by the European Parliament, we see that this was not the case. Yes, the need to harmonise asylum standards is broadly recommended by these texts. But, first and foremost, the reasoning seems weak. For example, it condemns the disparities in the way refugees are treated from one country to the next but does not provide examples. There may be perfectly legitimate reasons for these disparities, relating to the special features of a country, its culture or its links with former colonies.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, on closer inspection, there is only one serious reason – at least so it seems – for harmonising asylum standards: because abolishing internal border controls under the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that includes as far as third country nationals are concerned, demolishes the whole delicate legal balance and risks causing entirely uncontrolled secondary movements of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in fact, we are currently trying to solve a problem largely created by the Treaty of Amsterdam itself and, what is more, we are going to solve it to our disadvantage as it is clear that asylum standards cannot be harmonised from the bottom up – for who would dare? – but rather towards the top with all the in-draughts normally caused by this type of policy. We risk being caught up in the system. In order to escape, we can only invite the governments to exercise the utmost caution, retain as much power as possible, and interpret Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam narrowly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s succinct justification of his report expresses his misgivings on harmonisation with the fairly lax standards characterising the laws and common practice in some States, clearly showing the author’s desire to harmonise the right of asylum in the various countries of the European Union, but from the top. All the more so, given that a number of passages attack asylum abuses, even though governments in almost every country in Europe restrict this right, sometimes excessively stringently. This means that although, in some European countries, the application of this text could in theory improve the situation of asylum seekers, it would make it worse in others.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we have abstained from voting on this report, but we did vote in favour of the few articles, and especially the amendments, that at least express the idea that the right of asylum should be extended, and we denounce the scandalous nature of the policies of most European States, in particular France, which refuse to recognise this right, especially in the case of refugees from Algeria given the abuses by fundamentalists and the army. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, on the other hand, consider that there is a need for a great deal of change and that the Europe of peoples should mean freedom for all peoples, including the people of the Po Valley, and that those young people from the Po Valley also have the right to demonstrate without fear of insult or intimidation, because we want our flags to fly as well as the red flag. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem of political asylum seekers must be examined in this light alone and efforts to harmonize asylum policy come what may and turn it into a means of chipping away at fundamental human rights, reinforcing suppressive, policing measures and rebuilding fortress Europe must be blocked. It must not be used as a pretext for intensifying and strengthening the electronic filing systems created under Europol and Schengen, which target not only refugees but also the fundamental individual freedoms of the citizens of the EU themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">We must take all the legislative and other measures needed to respect the rights of asylum seekers, by strictly applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention. We must respect and strengthen all the provisions on protecting and granting asylum to individuals or groups being persecuted in their countries by government, quasi-government or other groups on ideological, philosophical, political, religious, racial, cultural or other grounds by giving them guarantees and a dignified reception and living conditions. </p>
<p class="contents">Asylum seekers in the Member States of the EU must be treated in a dignified and humane manner. We must also take proper account of all the parameters and peculiarities of their situation and of the dangers which threaten them should they return to their countries by introducing any protective measures required, even for those who do not satisfy the formal criteria for obtaining asylum, which criteria must be clearly defined in accordance with the principles of international law and fundamental human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">Arbitrary and violent deportation is a common occurrence because of the applicant’s difficulty in resorting to the judicial authorities for protection, and the phenomenon of group deportations is intolerable and violates conventions on and the principles of human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">We would like to highlight and draw attention to the fact that formulating even more harmonized criteria for granting asylum by gradually and effectively moving away from those laid down in the Geneva Convention and essentially replacing them with regulations such as those mentioned in the report, may have a negative and repressive impact. In this sense, we deplore the so-called “policy of burden sharing” which conceals a blatant attempt to relieve certain powerful states in the EU from the “burden” of receiving large numbers of refugees and relocating them to other countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we firmly believe that the best and most fundamental way to address the refugee issue is to maintain the right conditions for peace and the social, economic and democratic development in every country in the world. Until these conditions are guaranteed and while they are being undermined by major economic and military interests which destroy the structures, societies, rights and dignity of the people as they please and for their own benefit, then there will continue to be an ever rising tide of uprooted and persecuted individuals.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Dublin Convention allows asylum applications to be made only in the first State entered by the refugee. The aim of the Schmitt report is clear: “To re-enhance the reputation and substance of the right of asylum, the qualification procedure should be tightened up, and abuses resolutely curbed”.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the States on the edges of the Schengen zone are considered to be “secure”. They therefore become the border guards of fortress Europe. How can we consider countries that carry out serious discrimination against gypsies (Romania and Slovakia) as sufficiently safe for Belgium to send anyone it judges undesirable <span class="italic">en masse</span> there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the current concept of the refugee is far short of that stipulated by the Geneva Convention of 1951, “A refugee is any person who, owing to fear of being persecuted, is unable to avail himself of the protection of that country.” In fact, nowadays refugees have to provide more and more proof that their lives are under threat, which obviously is difficult, if not impossible. For the European Union to finally apply the right of asylum, it would have to break with the obsessive practice of immigration control. The more we respect freedom of movement, the more Europe will be worthy of those who seek refuge here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In its desire to “Communitise” and standardise refugee reception procedures, subject areas which are, by their very essence, matters of national sovereignty, Europe is dragging us along in its policy of small steps towards an area of social inequality, positive discrimination in favour of foreigners and high insecurity, where drugs, illegal immigrants, bogus asylum seekers entering the territory of a Member State for strictly economical reasons, terrorism and crime are free to move where they will.</p>
<p class="contents">For serious matters that affect the exercise of justice, the management of immigration into a country, public order or public freedom, the actions of the European Union can only and must merely be subsidiary and only concern truly transnational phenomena of criminality or public order problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this report, just like many others relating to immigration management, is unrealistic and highly populist. Because in fact, wanting to systematically favour foreign nationals over national citizens, whatever the cost, by means of many and varied forms of aid, particularly regarding proof, accommodation, keeping families together or even financial, medical and educational aid, will only lead to rejection by the population of the receiving country.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Members of the National Front and I myself will vote against this report which jeopardises people’s rights and security and also democracy. The creation of a legal penal system cannot be achieved in haste. “Communitising” procedures for asylum, justice and internal public order within the Member States cannot be achieved without first consulting all the citizens concerned. I bet that if they were to be consulted, our Eurocrats, those advocates of a centralised federal super-Europe would have to review their plans out of increased respect for democracy in the construction of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Reading Mr Schmitt’s report makes me think we are not talking about the same thing. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs appears to believe that the disparities in the laws of the Member States actually conceal asylum rights that are non-existent or not often applied, as if we were living under totalitarian regimes and our nations had not been providing asylum for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">This same committee discovers the laws of democracy when it suggests that the discrepancies from one country to the next are linked to the political context as much as to the content of the applications. It is clear that, for a European Union that is naturally and deliberately cut off from everyday reality, the political will expressed by the citizens during elections is of no great interest, unless it conforms to Community doctrine.</p>
<p class="contents">This House does not want to improve the situation for asylum seekers. The political will of this House is, in this field as in any other, to extend the scope of Community power to the detriment of the Member States, who are apparently unworthy of such power.</p>
<p class="contents">If the German people and their government wish to be the European Union country most welcoming to refugees, they are to be congratulated. If the other countries do not match this, often because they simply do not wish to, then it is nothing to do with the European Parliament and the Commission. Even the Socialist French Government “prefers” – and I quote – “a flexible approach enabling national characteristics of asylum procedure to be observed”.</p>
<p class="contents">So what about the recurring proposal that costs should be shared? Either the Member States have their own policy, for which they are responsible and which they therefore finance, or the European Union “Communitises” this field and includes the costs in its budget. If such and such a country finds its policy too expensive, let it change the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want a Community policy in the hands of the Commission, nor do we want the policy of another government: we want our people and their elected representatives to retain control over their own decisions and destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If people’s rights are infringed, it is the responsibility of surrounding countries to offer asylum to those who request protection from persecution. The nations of the world have a shared responsibility for ensuring that all refugees receive a welcome fit for human beings. No countries can argue their way out of responsibility when refugees seek asylum on their territory. Practice in granting asylum varies from one EU country to another. In general, however, policy on refugees has been tightened up throughout Europe in recent years. Coordination of the Member States’ responsibilities is necessary if countries are in practice to be able to pursue generous policies on refugees. </p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the Commission’s working document in principle, together with Ingo Schmitt’s report on the drawing up of a common policy on asylum and refugees, but we emphasise that it ought not to be the least generous countries which set the standards. We want to see a European policy on refugees which is better at distributing the overall burden between the countries of Europe on condition that the European, as well as the Swedish, policy on refugees will in future be more humane than they are at present. Nor must we forget that refugees and immigrants have a positive influence on the Member States. They often have experience and knowledge to contribute to society. Moreover, immigration is especially important now, given the shortage of labour which is beginning to make itself ever more felt in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Ingo Schmitt’s report, we want to emphasise that asylum applications ought always to be examined individually in the light of the individual applicant’s merits, as should also be the norm in the case of mass migrations. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, it is important that refugees should in principle be entitled to the same social benefits as other people resident in the particular country dealing with the application for asylum. This basic principle is established in the Geneva Convention and must be given due attention and complied with. We also think it important that the current definition of refugee and asylum in the Geneva Convention be reviewed and extended so that they also include people who seek asylum on the grounds of gender and sexual orientation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Germany has virtually ceased to grant asylum. Refugees are socially and legally marginalised or driven into the world of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Schmitt report is to extend this degrading and inhumane system to the entire European Union. It is precisely this system that is to serve as the basis for the “common standards on asylum procedures”. The problems of asylum legislation are not addressed in the Schmitt report. There is not a single word about inhumane pre-expulsion detention centres. Nor is there a word of criticism about social discrimination against refugees, which in Germany takes place under the Law on Benefits for Asylum-Seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmitt’s report omits to mention that refugees suffer from discrimination in the job market. In Germany, they are categorically forbidden to work. The rapporteur does not even mention the invasions of personal privacy or violations of data protection rights that are part of daily life for asylum-seekers. Thanks to “Eurodac” and the “Schengen Information System”, no other group of people is as closely monitored as refugees. They have become the first “transparent people”.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmitt’s report does not offer any potential solutions to all these problems. Instead, the rapporteur complains that people “wrongfully lay claim” to the right of asylum in Europe. Since the change in the right to asylum, many refugees no longer have any legal claim to asylum. It was, and remains, totally legitimate to want to live somewhere other than your place of birth. Framing this right and creating optimum conditions for it should be a key priority for this Parliament! Instead, the statements in the report help to discredit and criminalise asylum-seekers. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to accepting asylum-seekers, the Schmitt report demands “burden sharing” within the EU. Asylum-seekers are accordingly denigrated as being a burden. How can a humane asylum and refugee policy which meets the needs of refugees be based on a fundamental assumption of this kind?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Schmitt report welcomes agreements whereby third countries would promise to readmit rejected asylum-seekers. These are an instrument of a fortress Europe policy which has nothing in common with a humane refugee policy. Such readmission agreements can lead to people seeking protection being pushed back to their countries of origin, and make it easier for EU Member States to refuse asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmitt’s report also supports the concepts of “safe third countries” and “safe countries of origin”. These concepts are responsible for victims of political persecution failing to obtain asylum in Germany, that is to say whenever they enter via “safe third countries” or come from a “safe country of origin”. These instruments obstruct fair and equitable asylum procedures, and they should therefore be rejected and abolished as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must make proposals that take account of the interests of refugees and asylum-seekers in the European Union. We must press for an end to the policy of “fortress Europe”, of the weakening of the right of asylum and of undermining the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Everyone seeking refuge in the EU must have access to a just and fair reception procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Schmitt’s report goes in the opposite direction. It reinforces the fortress Europe policy and advocates further restrictions on long-term protection of refugees and asylum-seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the extension of a fortress Europe and I accordingly reject the resolution on “common standards on asylum procedures”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only sixty years ago, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Austrians and others, persecuted by their fascist or Nazi governments, were able to benefit from the right of asylum. It was our pride and our duty. In France, our most famous asylum seeker was General de Gaulle, who was able to benefit from the right of asylum in England in order to prepare the resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The main value of this report is that it wishes to unify the laws of the Member States on asylum procedure. Laws and procedures should be harmonised before the Dublin Convention and the Eurodac system are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be unfair to authorise only a single asylum request for the countries of the European Union, given that it does not have the same chance of success from one State to another.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the standards set by the report are too low. There are omissions and certain points are still unclear. Persecution is not just political or caused by the States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, persecuted Afghan women who are stoned for not wearing the chador, should without exception benefit from the right of asylum. Similarly, an Algerian journalist threatened with death by fundamentalists should be able to benefit from the right of asylum. Certain States that persecute dissidents are considered to be great democracies. This is why requests from Chechnya are not examined. In order to grant the right of asylum, the States require proof of persecution. But this is often difficult to provide, due to the persecution itself. The report remains vague on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the procedure should take account of family ties, language, cultural affinity and the colonial history of asylum seekers’ country of origin, in order to help them to cope with exile.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is abuse or people are turned away, it is because of the lack of coherent rules. It would be unacceptable to be suspicious and restrict this great achievement in the history of humanity, which remains the only lifeline for freedom fighters worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">I abstained on Amendment No 14. The aim of this amendment is to “request that in every application of the Eurodac system, emphasis be strongly placed on data protection in order to protect asylum seekers from any abuse of the information gathered”. This amendment admittedly aims to protect data on the information gathered. But I am against the actual idea of systematically collecting information, as by Eurodac, as I am against the very idea of accelerated procedures, which can give rise to many forms of abuse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, Europe has shown its great sense of responsibility in taking an interest in crime victims.</p>
<p class="contents">As highlighted in the report, the number of crime victims is constantly increasing. What is the solution? As far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is material, legal, medical, psychological and social assistance for crime victims. For us, the Members of the National Front, it is different. It is not the symptoms of the problem that must be treated, but the cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving support in this area is absolutely no use at all and merely enables the European governing bodies to ease their conscience. The very origins of crime in Europe must be tackled at source, because then, and only then, will the number of victims be reduced and will we be able to carry out our duty to help them to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we only need to make a simple observation to see that, throughout Europe, crime is increasing, people in urban and rural areas feel less and less safe, international terrorism, paedophilia, sex tourism, enforced prostitution and trafficking in women, money laundering, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and cross-border organised crime are ever increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of the sacrosanct principle of the freedom of movement of people, these are the people who are drugged, attacked or killed. Your unrestricted freedom of movement within your unachievable area of freedom, justice and security, is neither necessary nor unavoidable. On the contrary, it is by re-establishing our borders and refusing to grant the tenants of the ivory towers in Strasbourg and Brussels any power in the field of policing, justice or immigration, that the security of European citizens may be preserved and guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">So wake up and take responsibility! Weeping over and counting crime victims in Europe will not save them or bring them back: what we need to do is make sure that people do not become victims, and to achieve that, we must find ways of ensuring our security, which you are incapable of doing.</p>

What is more, it is important to look more closely at certain aspects of the report which, although they are more concerned with the last period of aid programmes than with providing an analysis after the event, are just as important for the current period.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for greater and more meaningful coordination between the Structural Fund initiatives, with particular reference to the ESF, and more tangible compatibility not only with the longstanding annual horizontal themes<span class="bold"> </span>– for example the SMEs – but also with new solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, since employment is one of the three governing motifs of the new programming period, Parliament should be kept regularly informed of the quality and quantity of available jobs by means of the Commission reports on the use of the funds in question. The information should include a balance sheet as well as forecasts.</p>
<p class="contents">One further aspect concerns another governing motif for the current period: regional and local development and related issues. New actions based on local initiatives carried out in a partnership framework have recently been introduced to boost the profile of this motif.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore becomes important not only to learn how to be efficient in implementing these guidelines but also to be aware of potential obstacles to their implementation, and always proceed in the knowledge that the Community also has an objective in terms of employment.

<p class="contents">Since the effect of Mr Speroni’s words was to discredit the people who raised the question, and seeing as I do not resort to methods other than speaking in this House, I would not like the serious nature of the incident which I condemned now to be played down, so to speak, or the situation to arise where the young people who were demonstrating in that manner are perceived as victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vice-President, I cannot repeat here what those young people were shouting because I feel that it would be unworthy of this Chamber to do so, but I would be quite willing to testify to what was said at any given moment. Extremely serious remarks were made regarding the President of the Commission, the Republic of Italy – our country – and 25 April, which is the date of liberation of Italy from the Nazis. I feel that the President of Parliament should set up an inquiry into this matter. Moreover, I myself am a polite person and I did not even look out of the window: I came to the Chamber and condemned the incident.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the matter should be examined in full. I understand from what Mr Speroni said that it was he who invited the group and that he clearly shares and supports these values which I, on the other hand, consider to be reprehensible. However, I do not want to sink into banalities and so I will limit myself to condemning this incident, which I consider is a serious matter for our institution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I did not invite the group, and I have already told the press that I do not agree with all that the group said. However, after the manner of Voltaire, I consider that anybody should be free to demonstrate his own ideas, especially in a place which represents the sovereignty of the people. </p>
<p class="contents">I realise that some language can be offensive, but when one is on the receiving end of a bucket of water one is quite likely to be somewhat free in one’s response. I would stress that the incident was recorded on film, and it is clear from this film that the bad language aimed at the person who threw the water was delivered after the water had been thrown.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am sure that we have all witnessed demonstrations, including demonstrations by other members of the party of the Member who has just spoken. When, for example, his fellow party members demonstrated in front of Fiat against the owner of the firm, the language used certainly did not lack force, but nobody dared to suggest that the language used during a demonstration had to be suitable for a court reception. I therefore maintain that it should be possible to express one’s opinions freely, even if this means giving offence. Should the need arise, the offended party can always take the necessary action through the appropriate channels. But freedom of speech must be upheld!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like her to clarify her remarks because not only did we vote for President Prodi but we have neither agreed in the past nor agree now with the insults delivered in the forecourt in front of the Parliament building. I fail to understand why Mrs Napoletano involved my party in the matter. I am genuinely perplexed. Please would she explain her reasons, for it is not our job to create bad feeling or pass judgement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are judging the behaviour of these young people because of the things they said, but I would like to know whether what Mr Speroni said is true, for if it is true that a Member of Parliament threw water over these people, the behaviour of the Member of Parliament is also reprehensible. I therefore feel that it is for the Presidency to clarify the sequence of events. Of course the language used is to be condemned, but we must make sure that we ascertain all the facts.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
