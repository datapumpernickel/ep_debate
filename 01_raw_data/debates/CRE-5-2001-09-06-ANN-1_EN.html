<p>It is the task of the Commission and the Member States to ensure that Council Regulation (EC) No 1146/2001 of 11 June 2001 concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Liberia is applied. Article 4 of that Regulation lays down that the Commission and the Member States shall immediately inform each other of the measures adopted under the said Regulation and shall supply each other with any other relevant information at their disposal concerning, in particular, violations, enforcement problems encountered, or judgments handed down by national courts. Moreover, under Article 6 of that Regulation, each Member State has to decide on the sanctions applicable in cases of infringement. Such sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>As to the specific question of the controls on imports of diamonds laid down by Council Regulation 1146/2001, the same applies here because those controls are carried out within the framework of existing customs provisions in Member States. In practice, the effectiveness of control measures can be considerably increased if the Member States of the EU agree bilaterally to introduce a specific programme of cooperation with the third country in question. Thus some Member States are cooperating closely with Angola and Sierra Leone under the Council regulations on imports of diamonds from those two countries <a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>.</p>

<p>Is the Council considering reviewing the EU’s common position on relations with Cuba?</p>
<p>Does it envisage including this issue as an item on the agenda for the Council of Foreign Ministers and, if so, when?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>As the Honourable Members are well aware, the Council, at its meeting of 25 June 2001, noted the ninth review of the common position of the European Union regarding Cuba.</p>
<p>The Council noted that, since the previous review in December 2000, there was no evidence of any significant fact which would indicate a change of policy on the part of the Cuban Government which would contribute to the achieving of the objectives of the common position. The Council therefore noted that the common position, the basis of the European Union’s policy on Cuba, remains valid. The Council will carry out a new review in six months’ time, as laid down in the common position.</p>
<p>The Council also reaffirmed that the objectives of the European Union with regard to Cuba are still to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Although the social and economic situation remains fragile, the Council found signs of an improvement in the population’s standard of living.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council stated that it is essential that the European Union and the Cuban authorities should engage in a constructive and frank dialogue on all issues of common interest. The Council demonstrated the European Union’s willingness to resume such a dialogue. As Honourable Members will know, the dialogue was broken off by the Cuban authorities when they cancelled an EU Troika mission at Director General level, which had been planned for 27 and 28 April 2000.</p>
<p>In the light of the ninth review of the common position, the Council also considered that the presence in Cuba of greater numbers of actors from the European Union would be a more effective contribution towards achieving the objectives of the common position, because this would provide opportunities for engaging in a process of dialogue, the exchanging of experiences, and apprenticeship for the future. The Council therefore encouraged the European Commission to step up its efforts to cooperate with, in particular, the civilian and non-governmental organisations in Cuba.</p>
<p>Finally the Council stated that it was in favour of holding a constructive dialogue with Cuba on a future framework cooperation agreement based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>On 10 July, the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Cuban Foreign Minister in Brussels. Although the meeting was a bilateral one, Mr Michel informed Mr Pérez Roqué of the Council’s conclusions following the ninth review of the common position and said that the European Union was willing to resume the dialogue as soon as the Cuban authorities were ready for a constructive and frank exchange of views on all issues of common interest including issues concerning democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, the Cuban authorities expressed a desire to continue discussions with the European Union. Therefore Mr Michel visited Havana on 23 and 24 August, in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, after having consulted the partners. Mr Michel led a fact-finding mission, and he was accompanied by representatives of the Commission, the Council Secretariat and Spain, which will be taking over the presidency. The aim of this mission was to assess the possibilities of engaging Cuba in an open and frank dialogue on all issues of common interest, in the light of the conclusions of the ninth review by the Council of the common position of the EU on Cuba. Mr Michel held meetings with President Fidel Castro, the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, Felipe Pérez Roqué, and the Vice President of the Council of Ministers and Minister for the Economy, Mr Rodrigues. He also met four representatives of Cuban dissidents. This fact-finding mission resulted in agreement between the two parties on the need to resume dialogue, without any preconditions and as quickly as possible, to discuss all issues of common interest, including human rights.</p>
<p>Mr Michel will be reporting back to his fellow ministers at the informal (Gymnich) Council meeting on 7 and 8 September.</p>
<p>With regard to the next review of the common position, when the time comes, the Council will have to take into consideration the situation on the ground and any developments that may have taken place.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the ministerial conference on tourism held in Bruges on 1 and 2 July and in the run-up to the Commission communication 'Framing the future for European tourism', what practical form will the Council give to the possible application of the open coordination method to tourism policy? What role might the European Parliament play in shaping tourism policy?

<p>The European Ministerial Conference “Tourism for All”, which was held in Bruges on 1 and 2 July 2001, recognised that the working method adopted by the working parties set up to explore the priority areas listed in the conclusions adopted in June 1999 by the Internal Market Council had proved to be very effective. This working method consisted of bringing together experts from Member States and from the tourism industry and interested groups, and reaching agreement on priority areas for action.</p>
<p>This shows that the open coordination method, as defined in the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit, is an appropriate working tool for achieving closer cooperation between Member States in the field of tourism.</p>
<p>With regard to initiatives in the social tourism sector, we must remember that it is the Commission’s task to propose new initiatives in this sector. To this end, the Commission also maintains regular contact with the tourism sectors in all Member States.</p>
<p>On this point, the Council refers the Honourable Member to its conclusions of 21 June 1999, in which it invited the Commission and the Member States to cooperate closely, taking due account of the principle of subsidiarity and to consult experts in the tourism sector.</p>
<p>At the moment, owing to the lack of any consensus on this question, the Council is not in a position to adopt a multiannual programme of the "Philoxenia" type. It remains convinced, however, as indeed it has stated on more than one occasion, that the tourism sector plays an important role in the economy, and that better use should be made of its contribution to growth and employment, by means of measures aimed at improving quality and making the most of human resources, and by means of better information and better communications.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0655"></a>

<p>On 28 June 2001 the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, was brought to The Hague. Mr Milosevic was handed over to the self-styled International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia despite the categorical opposition of Serbia's Upper and Lower Houses and Supreme Constitutional Court. The 'International Criminal Tribunal' has no international legal validity, but was set up at the instructions of the USA to carry out the New Order's political agenda. It was essentially founded by the very people who bombed Yugoslavia in breach of the most fundamental principles of international law, causing innumerable casualties and incalculable material and environmental damage. Mr Milosevic was handed over as part of a sordid financial deal following pressure on the country's present leaders. The Greek People has been - and still is - unanimous in expressing its revulsion at these developments. Typical expressions of this opposition are the letter signed by 83 Members of Parliament belonging to all parties (out of the 100 attending the summer session of the Greek Parliament) and the statements made by a large number of eminent public figures which appear in the press on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Will the Council say whether it condones practices of this kind which are in flagrant breach of the most fundamental principles of national sovereignty and international law?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council draws the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the European Council, meeting in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June 2001, invited the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbia in the region to continue to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Council emphasised the importance attached to the handing over of Mr Milosevic to The Hague, at the same time pointing out that this decision constituted an important step towards a rapprochement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Europe. On 25 June 2001, at its General Affairs meeting, it welcomed the adoption by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 22 June, of a decree on the subject of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal. It saw this as a positive step towards the total cooperation which should be given to the Tribunal.</p>
<p>As to the method by which Mr Milosevic was extradited, that is a matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the internal law of the Federation and its constituent states.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member’s objections to the handing over of Mr Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague therefore go against the positions taken up by the Council, and the latter reminds the honourable Member that the International Criminal Tribunal is a body set up by the Security Council of the United Nations, and a body with which all the member countries of the United Nations, including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, are obliged to cooperate under Resolution 827 of 25 May 1993. In conclusion, the Council believes that by transferring Mr Milosevic to The Hague the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has fulfilled its obligations as a member of the United Nations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0656"></a>

<p>During an exchange of views between the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Louis Michel, who is currently President of the Council of the European Union and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 10 July 2001, the question of finding a solution to the Cyprus problem arose. Mr Michel indicated that he viewed Turkey's proposal for an 'vague federal solution' as realistic and acceptable (to him), and added that this could take place 'in the long term, because the other side will have to agree'. In adopting this position, the President of the Council appears to have forgotten that the Cyprus problem was created by invasion and occupation. Turkey's proposal for a federal solution which Mr Michel has relayed wholesale essentially legitimises the invasion and the occupation and is contrary to the relevant UN resolutions which the European Parliament has repeatedly endorsed.</p>

<p>For several months, European dealers in raw cattle hides have been forbidden to export their products to markets in Asia, because of the situation with regard to foot and mouth disease. Although exports of meat and other food products have now been resumed – from Belgium as well as elsewhere – Asian markets remain closed to European dealers in raw cattle hides.</p>
<p>This ban on exports is bringing heavy pressure to bear on the European market in raw cattle hides because Italy is the only country to which all the other European countries can sell them. Moreover, Italy is taking advantage of the situation by negotiating very low prices. What is more, countries outside Europe and America are steadily taking over as suppliers for the whole of the Asian market, so that firstly European dealers are losing all their Asian customers and secondly the market is being flooded with hides.</p>

<p>As the Honourable Member has explained, because of the restrictive measures applied in the European Union since February 2001 following the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain (and to a lesser extent in France and the Netherlands), exports of animals and sensitive animal products to the Union’s trading partners were interrupted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Community measures have been lifted as far as France and the Netherlands are concerned, since it proved possible to eradicate the disease in those countries. This was not the case in Great Britain where, even now, the disease is not fully under control, and where the measures remain in force.</p>
<p>In most cases, trade with third countries has gradually resumed its normal course. However, some of the Union’s trading partners have not thought it advisable to restore normal trading relations with the Union since the measures were lifted. The Council reminds the Honourable Member that it is the Commission’s responsibility to negotiate with third countries to obtain the removal of any obstacles to trade resulting from sanitary and phytosanitary problems. In fact, the Commission is the Union’s spokesperson in Geneva at the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures set up by the 1994 Marrakech Agreements.</p>

<p>Experience in Finland has shown that fire protection in city buses is inadequate. There are particular problems with ‘low-floor buses’, in which the engine space is cramped and very well insulated, which means that the temperature, particularly in summer, may rise above the danger level. On the other hand, large numbers of disabled people travel on these buses in particular, as do people travelling with prams and buggies, which means that it is hard to evacuate the passengers quickly. It is easy and cheap, in relation to the cost of the vehicle and the risk involved, to equip the engine space with an automatic fire extinguishing system.</p>
<p>Is there any information available from other Member States about fire safety in buses, particularly low-floor buses? Does the Presidency propose to take any action to implement common fire safety provisions in the Community? On what timescale will it be possible to bring the passenger safety of low-floor buses up to an acceptable level?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>During Council discussions on the draft directive on special provisions applicable to buses and coaches, the Commission stated its intention of considering the results of the regulatory work carried out by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regarding low-floor buses, and of proposing any amendments to the directive in question if necessary.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes this undertaking on the part of the Commission, and will be ready to consider any proposed amendments resulting from the work of UNECE.</p>

<p>In its resolution of 5 July 2001<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Parliament 'commits the Belgian Presidency of the Council to reintroducing and this time bringing to a vote in the United Nations General Assembly of September 2001 a resolution on the abolition of the death penalty and to taking all steps necessary to obtain its adoption'. Given that 125 UN member countries now support abolition to varying degrees – and not 110 as certain NGOs suggest – a resolution aimed at establishing a universal moratorium on executions as a first step towards the universal abolition of the death penalty would have every chance of being adopted by the UN General Assembly provided that the EU acts decisively and coherently, whilst at the same time demonstrating openness and flexibility towards third countries.</p>
<p>Has the Council Presidency already asked or will it ask, on behalf of the 15 Member States, that the introduction of a universal moratorium on executions be entered on the agenda for the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly? What steps has it already taken to ensure that the Union speaks with one voice and with the determination necessary for this initiative to succeed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council reminds the Honourable Member of the content of the declaration on the abolition of the death penalty which was annexed to the Amsterdam Final Act. The European Union is opposed to the death penalty whatever the circumstances and has agreed to work towards its universal abolition. The EU is concerned by the fact that about 90 states retain the death penalty, although only a minority (30 countries) carry out executions each year.</p>
<p>In the context of its objective of universal abolition, in 1998 the European Union set out a series of guidelines to determine the circumstances in which it should take specific targeted action. In order to obtain the principal objective, which is the definitive abolition of the death penalty, the European Union attempts, in countries where the death penalty still exists, to limit its use progressively, and it insists that the penalty is carried out in a manner that observes certain minimum international standards. The European Union’s efforts to achieve the abolition of the death penalty are the expression of a deep conviction shared by all the Member States of the European Union. The abolition of the death penalty helps to improve respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council reminds the Honourable Member of the European Union’s memorandum on the death penalty, issued in 2000 and included in the annual report on human rights in 2000, and of the policy guidelines of the European Union regarding third countries in relation to this subject.</p>
<p>By virtue of these guidelines, the European Union also raises the question of the death penalty within multilateral bodies. Thus in 1999, 2000 and 2001 the European Union succeeded in having a resolution against the death penalty adopted by the Human Rights Commission. That resolution contains, amongst other things, a request to those states that still use the death penalty to limit its use progressively before abolishing it completely and, while they continue to use it, to observe certain fundamental criteria.</p>
<p>At the 54th United Nations General Assembly in 1999, the European Union attempted, for the first time, to have a resolution on the death penalty adopted which incorporated the wording of the text adopted on the Union’s initiative by the Human Rights Commission. Despite gaining a large measure of support (72 countries cosponsored the motion), the European motion for a resolution came up against strong opposition from those countries in favour of retaining the death penalty, which were determined that the text include a series of amendments that would to some extent have rendered it meaningless. At the time, this led the European Union not to pursue its initiative within the General Assembly.</p>
<p>In 2000, after having considered the timeliness of a European initiative on the death penalty at the 55th United Nations General Assembly, the European Union found that the political and diplomatic climate did not yet make it possible to remove the obstacles that had arisen at the 54th United Nations General Assembly. In those circumstances, it appeared that to adopt a resolution which might have constituted a step backwards, in comparison with what had been achieved by the Human Rights Commission resolution, would be unthinkable. Therefore the European Union took the decision not to submit its resolution.</p>
<p>As far as the 56th United Nations General Assembly is concerned, no decision has yet been taken. The European Union’s experts are continuing to examine all the elements relating to a possible initiative against the death penalty. That assessment will take into account, in particular, the difficulties encountered during the first half of 2001 in the context of the negotiation process, in particular on HIV/AIDS, racism and the treatment of children, and the current events which are threatening to overshadow the work of the United Nations General Assembly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Community aid to the countries of south-eastern Europe which are involved in the process of stabilisation and association, that is to say Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, amounts to EUR 4.65 billion for the period 2000-2006. This aid is provided, essentially, in the context of the CARDS programme launched in December 2000, which follows on from the previous programmes for the region, OBNOVA and PHARE.<span class="sup">1</span></p>
<p>The CARDS programme covers very different types of aid, including aid for recovery and reconstruction after a conflict. The European Agency for Reconstruction was created after the conflict in Kosovo, and initially it concentrated its efforts on the reconstruction of Kosovo. Since then its activities have been extended to cover the rest of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that is, Montenegro and Serbia<span class="sup">2</span>.

<p>The European Ministerial Conference “Tourism for All” was held during the Belgian Presidency in Bruges, on 1 and 2 July 2001. On that occasion the Commission submitted the final recommendations of the five working parties set up following the conclusions of the Council of 21 June 1999 on tourism and employment.</p>
<p>The Commission’s objective is now to adopt the communication “Framing the Future for European Tourism: a Strategic and Cooperative Approach” and, in November 2001, to send it to the Council, the Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. This communication will propose, in close consultation with all the parties involved, a contextual and strategic framework for tourism activities and policies within the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to use the open coordination method proposed at the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000, so as to facilitate the convergence of Member States’ policies on tourism and the coordination of policies and measures which have an impact on tourism. Representatives from the various tourism sectors will be consulted. An initial joint meeting between representatives of the industry, other operators in civil society and Member States is planned to take place on 5 September 2001.</p>
<p>Parliament ought to play a full role here, as it did in 1999, through its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in the case of the communication on increasing the potential of tourism for employment. The Commission is ready to submit to it the new communication and to respond positively and actively to any other request from Parliament that would help to clarify the proposals that will be formulated.</p>
<p>Since discussions on the working parties’ recommendations have not yet been completed, it is too soon, at present, to give any commitments regarding the Commission’s final proposals. The following basic principles will form the basis for those proposals:</p>
<p>- ensuring better coordination of the whole of the sector, by means of structured mechanisms for consultation, exchanges and information,</p>
<p>- improving knowledge of the sector at economic, social and environmental level,</p>
<p>- building on existing structure, bodies and centres of competence and knowledge, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity and encouraging access by means of networking.</p>
<p>The social aspect is, of course, well to the fore in these reflections, both for tourism professionals (working conditions, training, career prospects) and for tourists themselves (the disabled, the unemployed and people on low incomes).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0654"></a>

<p>The issues raised by the Honourable Member are both complex and controversial. The Commission is fully aware of the Honourable Members concerns on the safety aspects of the association of small toys and food, and of the view that the situation is not adequately addressed by existing rules. It is aware also of opposite views within the Parliament, which insist that the existing rules are adequate to address any potential risk, and that any further measures would be disproportionate.</p>
<p>The Commission's approach will be guided by the Treaty obligation to take, as a base for any measures which may be proposed, a high level of protection. This means that, on the one hand where measures are objectively justified to protect consumers it shall act without reserve, and on the other hand it will fulfil its Treaty obligation to ensure the free movement of goods. This means also that it will not agree to the introduction of measures at the national level which cannot be properly justified.</p>
<p>In a very comprehensive reply of 19 October 2000 to a series of Questions on this subject, the Commission explained the legal and administrative aspects in relation to the combination of non-food products with foodstuffs. On the specific issue of accidents involving children, it outlined the results of its investigation carried out with the assistance of the Emergencies Committee set up under article 8 of Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Two type of effects of the industrial fisheries are discussed: the direct effect on the target and by-catch species and the indirect effects on the ecosystem caused by the removal of large quantities of the target species, which are known to be important prey for a large number of animals.</p>
<p>The impacts on target species and commercially important by-catch species are assessed annually by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). According to ICES the industrial fisheries are sustainable both in relation to the target species as well as the by-catch species.</p>
<p>Regarding the indirect impacts of fisheries on the ecosystem the Commission is unaware of definitive scientific results which indicate that current catch levels in the industrial fisheries have created deleterious effects. The only exception to this position concerns an apparent lack of breeding success of a species of seabird off the east coast of Scotland. In response to this, fisheries for sandeels were closed in the appropriate area of the North Sea.</p>
<p>The Community already has in place measures to control the activities of vessels conducting industrial fisheries.

<p>The long-term goal of the Community is a reduction of the energy intensity (energy consumption per gross domestic product (GDP) created) by 1% per year. A rapid implementation of measures launched or proposed by the Commission on, inter alia, co-generation, energy performance of building and efficiency requirements for electronic apparatus would help to achieve this goal and to reduce the growth in energy consumption in all Member States. Under the so-called "Burden Sharing Agreement" decided upon in Council in June 1998 in regard to the Kyoto Protocol, Greece agreed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions to a 25 % increase by 2008-2012, from 1990 levels. The first report on Community greenhouse gas emissions monitoring in 2000 notes an expected rise in direct CO2 emissions of 28.8% in Greece from 1990 to 2008/12. No data have been reported on the other five Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases. Greece has provided a list of policies and measures that cover most of the relevant sectors and sources, but has not quantified the expected effects. New projections incorporating the latest list of policies and measures would be useful in assessing the extent to which Greece is likely to meet its commitment.</p>
<p>The new directive on large combustion plants whose final adoption is expected later this year will apply new requirements for older plants from 1 January 2008 which will substantially reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide in particular from the energy sector in Greece. Implementation of the related proposal on national emission ceilings and new air quality limit values will also reduce levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.</p>
<p>Where waste recycling is concerned, the Court of Justice ruled against Greece in its judgement of 13 April 2000 (Case C-99/123) on the grounds that Greece had failed to adopt implementing legislation to incorporate the Packaging Waste Directive into its national laws by the stipulated deadline of 30 June 1996. The Greek authorities indicated that new legislation is being prepared. This was initially announced for March 2001.

<p>In view of the Spanish Ministry of Health’s ban on the sale of olive-residue oil and the consequences this has had for the sector, can the Commission say what progress has been made in its studies on benzopyrene and state its conclusions regarding the limit values it intends to propose?</p>
<p>Pending the legislation on benzopyrene, what provisional measures will the Commission take to ensure proper consumer protection, without jeopardising the olive-oil sector?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>On 3rd July 2001, as required by Community legislation, Spain informed the Commission’s Rapid Alert System for Food that it had withdrawn products from the market, in this case olive-residue oil contaminated with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo(a)pyrene. PAHs are known carcinogens.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the Commission must immediately issue a Rapid Alert notification to Member States and request the necessary further details. In this case Spain was asked for details of test results, and distribution to Member States and third countries. Ideally such information should be submitted with original notifications, but this is not always possible, particularly where a general contamination problem is being investigated. It is important to inform the Member States immediately when urgent information is received, so they can begin their own investigations and consider whether national action is necessary to protect consumers.</p>
<p>Contamination of Spanish oil was first identified by authorities in the Czech Republic, at the end of May 2001. However, details were initially unclear and the Spanish authorities made an investigation. Spain notified the Commission after tests confirmed that products were contaminated. This contamination concerned only olive-residue oil and was a result of the production process.</p>
<p>On 6 July, at a meeting of the Commission’s Expert Committee on Contaminants in Food, Spain presented data showing levels of PAHs in olive-residue oil many times higher than guideline levels used by the vegetable oil industry. Subsequent investigations in Spain identified the precise stages of production where the contamination arose. This process is now being changed. In addition, the investigations in Spain revealed details of the distribution of products to several Member States and third countries. All of these destinations have been informed via the Rapid Alert System.</p>
<p>No harmonised maximum levels exist for PAHs in food, but the general food safety provisions of the framework regulation on contaminants apply<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>. In such cases Member States may take action based upon national provisions to protect consumer safety. In this instance, Member States withdrew suspect products from the market. Spain offered to take back any contaminated olive-residue oil. Options on what to do with the contaminated oil are being considered, such as reprocessing or use in non-food products such as fuel oil.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) made an urgent assessment and concluded that there were no immediate risks from the levels of PAHs found, but the long-term risks from regular exposure to such high levels in food might be unacceptable, particularly regarding the risk of cancer. Therefore contaminated foods must be withdrawn. The SCF will perform the assessment of long-term risk whilst Member States collect data on actual levels of PAHs in different foods. The outcome of these activities will help determine whether harmonised maximum levels need to be set.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is presenting regular reports on convergence and approximation of applicant countries' legislative frameworks to the acquis. While some significant progress has been noted, the situation varies significantly among applicant countries and among different industries within each applicant country. During the period since it entered into its Europe Agreement, the Czech Republic has granted subsidies to its banking industry equal to approximately 20% of GDP, apparently without meaningful measures to avoid distortions to competition. This had led to the filing of a complaint with the competition service of the Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission has been following attentively the competition dimension of the various restructuring operations in the Czech financial sector, notably in the light of the Czech Republic’s obligations under the Europe Agreement. The Commission is of the view that greater transparency is first needed regarding these operations, before any conclusions can be drawn regarding compliance with the Europe Agreement. To this end the Commission is following up in detail these issues with the Czech authorities using fully the mechanisms of the Europe Agreement.</p>
<p>The overall track record of the Czech Republic in compliance with the competition acquis, including in the financial sector, is currently in the process of being assessed, as follows.</p>
<p>In the framework of the accession negotiations, the Commission is assessing for each candidate country whether the conditions are met that could allow for the provisional closure of the competition chapter. Three elements must be in place to reach that objective: (1) the necessary legislative framework with respect to antitrust and State aid; (2) an adequate administrative capacity; and (3) a credible enforcement record of the competition acquis. These three conditions, in particular the enforcement record, are currently being examined by the Commission with a view to forming its official position in the second half of the year, in line with the negotiation Road Map, agreed at the Nice European Council of December 2000.</p>
<p>The Commission last commented on the Czech Republic's overall progress in implementing the competition acquis in its Regular Report of November 2000. This concluded that alignment of Czech legislation on State aid was now well advanced, but that the main challenge was still to ensure the effective application and enforcement of State aid rules, where greater efforts were required. This year's Regular Report is currently under preparation and will be adopted in November.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0627"></a>

Such protection may also be derived from Article 24 of the Charter which stipulates, in paragraph 1, that children shall have the right to protection and to the care necessary for their well-being.</p>
<p>Such a principle should be respected by the Union, in accordance with the scope of the Charter which, under Article 51, is addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. Moreover, as far as candidate countries are concerned, respect for human rights, including the rights of the child, is one of the political criteria for accession laid down by the European Council in Copenhagen, and is examined by the Commission, in particular in the context of its regular contacts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0643"></a>

<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The European Commission Humanitarian aid office (ECHO) in Cuba is to be closed in March as Community emergency assistance to Cuba is no longer needed. However, the Commission is putting equivalent funds into economic assistance which needs a different kind of presence. The Commission aims to make its co-operation with Cuba as efficient as possible. One should not read into this shift that the Commission is less attentive to the Government's human rights record.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted a Communication to the Council and the Parliament on 3 July 2001. It foresees a number of new Delegations to be opened by the end of 2002. As far as Cuba is concerned the Communication sets out that a regular presence on the island is to be considered in the light of internal developments and the forthcoming closure of the ECHO office.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Catalan is spoken by eight million people. In Spain, it is the joint official language of the autonomous communities of CATALONIA, the BALEARIC Islands, VALENCIA (in the form of the Valencian dialect), and the Eastern part of ARAGON. Outside Spain, it is the autochthonous language of the Pyrénées Orientales department in France and the town of Alghero in Sardinia. It is also the official language of Andorra. Catalan is therefore spoken by more people, over a wider area, than several of the official languages of the European Union.</p>
<p>Given that respect for cultural and linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental principles of the Union, does the Commission consider the status accorded to Catalan within the Community institutions to be keeping with this principle?

<p>In accordance with Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the Council adopted Regulation No 1 of 1958 (subsequently amended to take into account the accession of new members) determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community. It laid down the official languages and the working languages of the institutions as being German, English, Danish, Spanish, Finnish, French, Greek, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.</p>
<p>This regulation, which is concerned with the operation of the institutions, in no way casts doubt upon the cultural and linguistic importance of languages other than those quoted, including Catalan. For its part, the Commission attaches great importance to the respecting of cultural and linguistic diversity in the Union, without considering it necessary to propose any amendments to Regulation 1/1958. In this area, the Commission does not have any specific power of initiative.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Community has undertaken many initiatives to promote cultural and linguistic diversity. A good example is the European Year of Languages, the aim of which is to make the public at large aware of languages and to promote multilingualism and the learning of languages by organising information and public-awareness projects.

<p>As the Commission has explained on various occasions when similar questions regarding the National Land Register in Greece have been put by the Honourable Member and by other Members of Parliament, since the beginning of the year the Commission has held a series of discussions and exchanges of letters with the Greek authorities on the subject of the project being co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Those authorities, in reply to questions from the Commission, submitted voluminous files, in February and again in May, explaining their position with regard to the various points raised by the Commission.</p>
<p>This correspondence has been taking place in the context of the procedure laid down in article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> laying down provisions for the implementation of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The Commission carried out an in-depth analysis of all the information provided by the Greek authorities. The conclusions of that analysis were sent to the Greek authorities in July, thus giving them an opportunity to inform the Commission of any new factors that might have arisen in the meantime or to correct any errors. We expect a reply from the Greek authorities by the end of September 2001.</p>
<p>On the basis of the file that was prepared and of any comments by the Greek Government, the Commission will take a final decision on this project, in particular on the question of whether to reduce or possibly cancel Community aid.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the National Land Register project in Greece is not part of any programme adopted by the Commission under the third Community Support Framework (CSF) and in particular the recently adopted Environment Programme. Consequently it is not eligible for co-financing under the third CSF.</p>
<p>When the present procedure finally comes to an end, then it will be necessary to decide whether, and if so subject to what conditions, the National Land Register project in Greece can once again become eligible for co-financing under the third CSF.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 1998 and 1999 the riverside plant cover was cleared from the Sierra de Baza Nature Reserve. Poplar trees were thus cut down, harming the riverside vegetation as a whole and the ecosystem which this constituted. Reports by the Spanish nature conservation service, SEPRONA, indicate that nearly 14 000 trees were indiscriminately felled, although, according to the administrative permits granted by the authorities, only the dead wood was supposed to be removed and put to use. The illegal felling has created eutrophication problems. Ecosystems protected by Community legislation have likewise been damaged, in particular deciduous Mediterranean woodland, a natural habitat of Community interest. Protected species have been endangered. No environmental impact assessments have been carried out, nor have remedies been proposed. Investment in the nature reserve has been financed by EAGGF funds.

<p>The site in question covers an area of over 53 833 hectares. This area includes up to 18 different types of habitat covered by Annex I to the said Directive, of which five are priority habitats (6110, 7220, 6220, 9561, and 9533).</p>
<p>Felling activities have to be carried out by an approved plan, but in this case it appears that they cut down trees irrespective of the prescriptions.</p>
<p>Felling activities are not supported by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), but the Honourable Member indicates that other activities for nature conservation purposes in these areas have been financed. This also does not exclude the felling of trees. On the same grounds EAGGF does not support actions of forest habitats restoration after damage. It provides only for actions that enhance the ecological functions of forests and not for restoration of damaged forest areas.</p>
<p>The Commission will be contacting the Spanish authorities to ask them what measures need to be implemented in order to comply with the Habitats Directive, in particular Article 6 thereof.</p>

<p>For several months, European dealers in raw cattle hides have been forbidden to export their products to markets in Asia, because of the situation with regard to foot and mouth disease. Although exports of meat and other food products have now been resumed – from Belgium as well as elsewhere – Asian markets remain closed to European dealers in raw cattle hides.</p>
<p>This ban on exports is bringing heavy pressure to bear on the European market in raw cattle hides because Italy is the only country to which all the other European countries can sell them. Moreover, Italy is taking advantage of the situation by negotiating very low prices. What is more, countries outside Europe and America are steadily taking over as suppliers for the whole of the Asian market, so that firstly European dealers are losing all their Asian customers and secondly the market is being flooded with hides.</p>
<p>Will the Commission take action to deal with this situation? If so, how, and can it do so soon, in view of the highly precarious situation facing European dealers in raw cattle hides? If not, why not?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the restrictions on imports which certain Asian countries have imposed regarding raw cattle hides originating from the Community. These restrictions were imposed following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in “continental Europe” in March 2001.</p>
<p>This external problem has also had internal repercussions on trading relations between Member States. The surplus of hides which some Member States are having difficulty disposing of has put great pressure on their markets. This does not appear to be a universal problem within the Community. Some Member States are still suffering from a shortage of raw hides on their markets.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have any legal instrument that would allow it to intervene in the internal market for raw cattle hides. In other words, the market is governed by the laws of supply and demand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as regards restrictions placed on imports by certain Asian countries, the Commission has successfully undertaken negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), with a view to persuading third countries to apply European and international health standards.</p>
<p>The Commission has in this way succeeded in getting several measures restricting imports lifted, but there are still certain others in existence. Since the end of August, eleven Member States have been recognised as being free from foot-and-mouth disease under the rules of the International Office of Epizootics. Restrictions on imports of hides from the Community are therefore becoming increasingly unjustified. When restrictions are applied to hides coming from countries not affected by foot-and-mouth disease, they are no longer justified and must therefore be removed.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its efforts at both bilateral and multilateral level and in particular within the WTO SPS Committee (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0660"></a>

<p>The part-time work directive clearly makes it possible for pay and other entitlements to be based on the number of hours worked (the pro rata temporis principle) in order to ensure equal treatment. In some cases, however, benefits are accrued only through longer-term employment relationships, possibly because jobs in which fewer hours are worked typically do not possess the confidential nature that is an essential feature of salaried work. Nevertheless, the Danish Ministry of Labour takes the view that the limit on the number of hours worked laid down in the Salaried Employees Act has to be lowered from 15 to 8 hours so that Denmark meets the requirements of the part-time work directive.

<p>The Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that Community law – notably Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> - protects the social security rights of migrant workers by co-ordinating the different national social security schemes of Member States. One of the main principles of this co-ordination is to determine the social security legislation which is applicable to a migrant worker. As a rule, such a worker is subject to the social security legislation of the Member State where he or she is employed. Therefore, if a person works in Northern Ireland he or she is principally subject to the social security legislation of the United Kingdom. But the Honourable Member seems to refer to an important exception to this rule which is contained in Regulation 1408/71, namely the one relating to the posting of workers. A posted worker is normally employed by an employer in one Member State, but the employer sends him or her to another Member State to perform work there for a limited period of time. Under these circumstances the posted worker remains subject to the social security legislation of the sending Member State and contributions must continue to be paid to the social security scheme of this Member State. Nevertheless, the posted worker is entitled to health care in the Member State of employment on behalf of the Member State to which contributions are paid.</p>
<p>Although Community law determines which social security legislation is applicable, Member States remain free to determine both the conditions concerning the right or duty to be insured with their social security scheme (e.g. as concerns coverage for health care) and the conditions for entitlement to benefits provided that these do not discriminate between their own nationals and those of other Member States. It then remains for each Member State whose social security legislation has been determined to be applicable to ensure that its respective legislation, e.g. concerning the payment of social security contributions, is complied with. It should furthermore be stressed that the Commission can only ensure proper application of Community law in the field of social security by governments of Member States and does not act as inspector in the social field.</p>
<p>As regards minimum wages and holiday rights, which are working conditions, the rules of Directive 96/71/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>, must be observed if the agency is a temporary employment undertaking or placement agency hiring out workers to a user undertaking in Northern Ireland, provided that there is an employment relationship between, in this case, the Portuguese company and the posted workers.</p>
<p>In the situations covered by the Directive, the Member States are required to ensure that, whatever the law applicable to the employment relationship, the undertakings concerned guarantee posted workers certain terms and conditions of employment in force in the host country. These terms and conditions - considered mandatory rules - include in particular minimum rates of pay and minimum paid annual holidays. Where such mandatory rules are determined by the law of the host country, the Directive covers all sectors of activity. Where the terms and conditions of employment are laid down by collective agreements which have been declared universally applicable, the Directive applies to activities relating to construction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

However, Nicole Fontaine has already expressed the wish that the Irish should not be granted any derogations which would make the Treaty of Nice even less effective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an opinion poll carried out in France (where no referendum has been held) reveals that over 54% of that country's people would reject the Treaty. Its parliament has ratified it nonetheless.</p>
<p>However, in the wake of the Irish referendum and in the absence of unanimity, any ratification procedure should be halted. How does the Commission intend to make good the democratic deficit and bring the EU closer to the people if it disregards the majority view?

<p>The malfunctioning of the United Nations International Drug Control programme (UNDCP) has already been the subject of a position adopted by the Commission and set out in the answer supplied by the Commission to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0392_EN.html">H-0392/01</a> at Parliament’s plenary session of May 2001.</p>
<p>Following the serious allegations concerning the operating methods of the UNDCP, an investigation was carried out, which resulted in two reports by the services of the United Nations Organisation (UNO).</p>
<p>Following a detailed analysis, it seems that the Board of Auditors and the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) identified certain practices that were subject to criticism, and in particular they criticised a management style which was too personalised, deficiencies in budget programming, poor management of human resources (especially at headquarters) and mediocre implementation of worldwide programmes. The reports in no way confirm the existence of fraud or the misuse of funds.</p>
<p>These criticisms have given rise to concern on the part of states which grant non-targeted subsidies to the UNDCP and which participate directly in funding the headquarters or certain worldwide projects. Those states are not involved in either the identification or the implementation of the projects.</p>
<p>Those states also second experts to the UNDCP, and they expect those experts to be able to work in good conditions and have real responsibilities.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission is concerned, although the Council Regulation makes provision for a lump-sum contribution to the UNDCP, there has been no Community financing destined for the worldwide programmes or the UNDCP headquarters. Funding is granted solely on the basis of projects which are sometimes assessed by the Commission. Before approval, such projects are examined in accordance with normal procedures and are referred to the Financing Committees. The Commission then monitors their implementation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission does not second any experts to the UNDCP.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has decided to conduct an audit of each of the current projects. Like the majority of the Member States, the Commission does not envisage any change in its position, since it does not have at its disposal any new information that would justify such a change. In the context of the Major Donor Group, the Commission is participating in the discussions on how to improve the effectiveness of the UNDCP.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the "Protocol on the Protection and Welfare of Animals", which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Institutions have to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals when formulating and implementing Community legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission is taking full consideration of animal welfare issues, among others, by ensuring high standards for the welfare of animals on the farm, during transport and at slaughter, by improving the protection of wild animals by regulating trade therein and the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and it is taking into account animal welfare concerns in its technical legislation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the competencies of the Commission are limited and Member States remain generally responsible for matters of cruelty against animals, such as mistreatment and the use of animals in competitions or shows.</p>
<p>Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos aims to improve the situation of wild animals kept in zoos. In particular, Article 3, 3<span class="sup">rd</span> indent, specifies the requirements on zoos regarding accommodation and husbandry. However, the provisions of the Directive are not yet applicable, as the deadline for transposition of the Directive is 9 April 2002. Once it is in force, the responsibility for enforcing the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive lies with the Member States.</p>

<p>Mr Kinnock has said that reputable scientific studies show that the use of depleted uranium shells poses no threat to human health or the environment, despite the fact that fresh evidence to the contrary appears with every passing day; one example is the document by the US Department of Defense of August 1993 which states that the expected consequences of exposure of human beings to depleted uranium dust is an increased incidence of lung and bone cancer.</p>
<p>By letter of 13 February 2001 I asked Mr Kinnock to forward these studies to me. In his reply he said he was forwarding my request to the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Wallström, but so far - five months later - I have still not received any reply or any study.</p>

<p>In the Commission’s reply in the context of Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0055_EN.html">H-0055/01</a> by Mrs. Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou given during Question Time of the February 2001 plenary session of the Parliament, Commissioner Kinnock confirmed that there was well documented scientific consensus that the impact of test firing of depleted uranium (DU) shells in marine waters would be minimal compared to the ubiquitous natural occurrence of uranium.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member subsequently requested transmission of the studies that the Commission would have referred to. In fact the Commission did not have in mind any specific document on the issue but rather the above-mentioned scientific consensus.</p>
<p>Few days later the Commission received the opinion of the Group of Experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty. This document was immediately released to the press, was available on the EUROPA web-site, and raised a wide interest at international level.</p>
<p>While the Experts dealt essentially with general uses of DU, against the background of military uses and the consequences DU shells impacting on terrestrial targets, the document also contains a paragraph (53) reading as follows:</p>
<p>“Test firing is being carried out in the sea. Due to the low corrosion rate and to the large volume of surrounding seawater, no detectable increase of uranium concentration in seawater or biota is expected.”</p>
<p>The Experts thus fully confirmed the position taken by the Commission.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine months after signature and ratification by the Greek Parliament of the transfer document for the Thessaloniki underground, negotiations are continuing for the conclusion of loan agreements; moreover the Commission representative told the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions on 9 July that in view of the risk that the transfer agreement would be declared void, written authorisation for extending the negotiations had been given twice and that the matter remained in suspension as the financial agreements between the contractor and the lenders had not been finalised and the works themselves therefore could not begin.</p>

As the delays have meant that the project cannot be carried out under the second CSF and as the handling of the matter by the Commission and the EIB is required to be in accordance with the treaties, Community law and the Community's interests, how will the Commission and the EIB safeguard the Community's interests in the timely execution of the project during the term of the third CSF for Greece?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Having already replied to questions in the same vein a number of times in the past few months and having presented in June and July its position in the petitions Committee, the Commission regrets that it is not in a position to add a great deal today to the information that has already been given to the Parliament.</p>
<p>According to the principles of subsidiarity and the methods which have been established for the implementation of the Structural Fund regulations the Commission can take no responsibility for the conduct of negotiations between the concessionaire of a particular project and those bodies from whom the concessionaire intends to borrow money.

<p>Denmark does not have any legislation on the production and marketing of raw milk intended for human consumption or of products based on raw milk, since the latter are prohibited.</p>
<p>Under Article 249 (ex Article 189) of the EC Treaty, a directive is binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but it leaves the national authorities to decide upon the form and methods.</p>
<p>As the Court of Justice has regularly confirmed, the transposition of a directive into national law does not necessarily require the provisions being transposed to be reproduced formally and word-for-word in a specific national provision. However, it is essential that the restrictive measures contained in a directive should be included in a national act in such a way as to create a legal context which will suffice to ensure that the measures are applied.</p>
<p>Consistent judgments by the Court also show that in cases where a directive lays down optional provisions or does not place a specific area entirely under regulation, the Member State has the right, within the limits of the general principles of the EC Treaty, either not to transpose the optional part of the directive or to retain or create national legislation to supplement the Community provisions.</p>
<p>In the case referred to by the Honourable Member, and with reference to the provisions of Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992, it is necessary to point out that Community legislation has not laid down any instructions regarding health, except in cases where a Member State wishes to permit the use of raw milk.</p>
<p>The result, as the Commission has already stated in its replies to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0364_EN.html">H-0364/01</a> during Question Time at the plenary session of Parliament in May 2001 and written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2001-1794_EN.html">P-1794/01</a> put by the Honourable Member, is that the requirements laid down in Article 4 of Directive 92/46/EEC are only applicable in cases where a Member State authorises the placing on the market of milk intended for direct human consumption, whereas under Article 7(A)(9), each Member State has to lay down its own health rules for milk-based products which are not made from heat-treated milk or which have not been subjected to any heat treatment during their manufacturing process, and those rules must be sufficient to enable such products to meet the health criteria guaranteed for every finished product.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Owing to the lack of consensus within Community industry, there are no harmonised rules at Community level on indication of the origin on products marketed in the Community, as this is a matter for the national legislation of the Member States. Where such national regulations exist, they generally refer to the non-preferential origin of products in accordance with the World Trade Organisation Agreement on rules of origin. Under the Community Customs Code<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, goods are deemed to originate in a country if they are wholly obtained or produced in that country or, where several countries are involved, if they underwent their last, 'substantial', processing or working in that country.

<p>The Commission regrets the rejection by the Parliament of the Proposal for a Directive on Take over bids. Although this Proposal did not intend to promote the take over bid technique as the only or preferable technique for corporate restructuring, it is clear that the continued absence of common rules for take over bids makes corporate acquisitions more difficult. This is particularly so because of the possibility for an offered company in the case of a hostile take over bid to continue applying defensive measures aimed at frustrating the bid. The Commission has therefore announced that it will come back with a new proposal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Given the extent of the corporate restructuring currently taking place among European telecommunications companies, it may be that the telecommunications sector will be one of the sectors most affected by the absence of common rules on take-over bids, but in itself rejection of the Proposed Directive is unlikely to affect the pace of restructuring in this sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
