<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I think it is well worth restating once again the historic significance, the political importance and the irreversible nature of the process of enlarging the Union. Having said that, I believe, when it comes to assessing the prospects for the process of enlarging the European Union with a view to the next European Council, that we must begin with the objectives we had set at the start of our Presidency so that we can then consider what we can expect of Seville in light of what has been achieved so far.</p>
<p class="contents">You will remember, Mr President, that in the debate we held this morning on the preparation of the Seville Council, I avoided dealing with enlargement issues, specifically so that we could reserve them for this debate, in which we are going to deal solely with those issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the issue of enlargement is one of the fundamental subjects for the Seville European Council and I therefore believe that the information I am going to give will indicate the key elements of what the Presidency and the Council are going to propose to that Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of the Presidency we presented a working programme entitled ‘More Europe’; that document naturally included the enlargement of the European Union as one of our fundamental priorities, or more than a priority, one of the Union’s fundamental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It stated that the Presidency’s objective was to contribute decisively to concluding the negotiations with all the candidate countries which are prepared by the end of the second half of 2002, thereby following up on the conclusions of the previous European Councils of Gothenburg and Laeken. More specifically, our main task consisted of achieving common positions between the 15 countries on the most complex chapters of the acquis, that is to say, those which fall to us according to the ‘road map’, those which are most significant from a financial and budgetary point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the famous road map agreed in Nice, those chapters – which have fallen to the Spanish Presidency – are agriculture, regional policy and the financial and budgetary provisions, to which we can add another sensitive chapter, which is not sensitive financially, but because of its highly political nature; the issue of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, we thought that we were going to proceed to the provisional conclusion of all those chapters pending at the beginning of the six-month period because – as you and the House know, Mr President – Spain was not only faced with the ‘road map’, but also with a huge number of euphemistically named ‘leftovers’, which in fact are unfinished negotiations, extremely important negotiations, which remained following the Swedish and the Belgian Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Two fundamental principles must continue to inspire and underpin the entire negotiation process and they are that the negotiations should be carried out on the basis of the current acquis<span class="italic"> </span>and that the financial perspectives approved in Berlin in 1999 will have to determine the upper limits for the accession of the new Member States between now and 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In this negotiation we also tried to prevent any overlapping or interference by the enlargement process with any possible reforms of the common policies, because if we try to make the reform of common policies conditional upon enlargement we will risk creating a delay with regard to the scheduled timescales.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Union has an objective that has the full support of Parliament: that accession should take place during 2004. As well as this general objective, the specific working programme of the Presidency for enlargement, which was presented to the Council last January, included a whole series of related tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, compliance with the third requirement for accession which relates to the administrative and judicial capacity to effectively apply the acquis. Not much is said about this, but it is a very important issue. This is the famous so-called ‘Madrid criterion’ which is absolutely essential if enlargement is to work.</p>
<p class="contents">During this six-month period, the Commission has drawn up and implemented an action plan for each of the candidate countries and will present a report in this regard in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a group drawing up the Accession Treaty was scheduled to be set up during the Presidency, and it began its work in March. Together with the Commission and the Secretariat-General of the Council, we came up with the idea of beginning to think about a working group to draw up the Accession Treaty, so that the drawing up of its text and its relevant annexes should run parallel with the negotiations in order that, when the negotiations are concluded, we would not waste time drawing up the text of the Treaty, because we all know, Parliament in particular, the difficulties involved in the national ratification processes. We do not therefore have much time if we want to achieve our objective in 2004, especially in order to have everything ratified so that all the candidate countries can participate as full members in the elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we had that purpose – which, incidentally, we have fulfilled – and, as has been the case with previous presidencies, the Spanish Presidency has also paid particular attention to four specific cases, because it seems as if the ten countries designated for the first wave are the sole object of our enthusiasm, which is not true. We must pay attention to Bulgaria and Romania, two countries which have made less progress and to which we have to lend specific support in order to open as many negotiation chapters as possible, and we also wanted in some way to contribute to the efforts to find a definitive peaceful solution to the issue of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, neither must we forget that somehow we must promote the pre-accession strategy with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these initial approaches, we must ask ourselves what we have achieved so far during our Presidency, since what we have done over these months will dictate how the situation and the perspectives between now and the end of the year are assessed by the coming European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to tell you, Mr President, that, with the invaluable help of the Commission – and I would like to pay homage publicly to Commissioner Verheugen, who is in charge of enlargement, who has been truly instrumental in all the progress we have made – the progress made during the Spanish Presidency can be summed up as follows: the Council, in its various guises, has begun to examine the notes presented by the Commission on 30 January on the general financial framework and agriculture, on which there was a clear lack of consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental difference of opinion – and we are still negotiating in this regard – relates to the provision by the Union of direct agricultural aid to the candidate countries and the fact that this aid may, according to some countries, prejudice the future reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these disagreements, we have not yet achieved a common position on the agriculture chapter; I would say we have achieved 95% of a common position, but there is still 5%, relating to direct aid on which we have yet to reach a consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to promote a compromise formula because we understand the reasoning of the four countries which are blocking the common position, but we also believe those countries must understand that, in agriculture, there are certain fundamental principles relating to respect for the acquis, respect for equality between the member countries and the candidate countries and above all the fact that the ‘road map’ cannot be delayed. That is to say that all those countries which for certain reasons are hindering the adoption of the common position on direct aid will have to answer for their political responsibility before this Parliament – and I hope that you will demand it – and before public opinion, for not having made possible a common position which would finally conclude the entire ‘road map’ for the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making efforts, we held a General Affairs Council on Monday, we are dealing with this issue today in Coreper; there will be another extraordinary Coreper on Friday; we are going to deal with the issue again at the General Affairs Council on the 17 June and, if necessary, we will have to take it to the European Council. We do not want the European Council to become a battlefield for these issues, but everyone must be aware that we have to make a collective effort to completely conclude the agriculture chapter; we cannot say that 95% is concluded and we will conclude the 5% on direct aid later. It cannot be delayed because it is a question of principle: we must accept the principle although the methods can be discussed later.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the first two negotiation conferences in March and April, and the ministerial meeting we have just held, with Commissioner Verheugen and myself, on Monday, and also with Mr Piqué, on Monday and Tuesday of this week, a total of 83 chapters have now been negotiated, of which 49 were provisionally concluded and another eight were opened. Furthermore, in April, for the first time we dealt with and concluded with certain candidates countries three of the four chapters which the road map assigned to the Spanish Presidency, that is, regional policy, financial and budgetary provisions and institutional provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fourth and final chapter, and no doubt the most complex, agriculture, the debate is ongoing in the Council, we have yet to reach a common position and therefore have not been able to conclude it. Our objective has been to reach a consensus, as I indicated previously in the General Affairs group of 10 June; it has not been possible and we are continuing with our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the countries which are most behind, with Bulgaria all the pending chapters have opened, while with Romania seven chapters have been opened, with just 6 still pending; I would like to inform the House that, together with the Commission, we expect to be able to make even more progress this month and certainly before the end of the Presidency, on 27 or 28 June, we are going to hold a new negotiation conference at Vice-President level and it is possible that we will be able to conclude more chapters with Romania and, naturally, conclude a few more other than the ones concluded at ministerial level. It is therefore very possible that the Spanish Presidency will end with the opening of all the chapters relating to Romania and with the conclusion of between 90 and 100 chapters with the rest of the candidate countries. Therefore, if we look at the general picture, as I said this morning, the majority of countries have concluded between 25 and 28 chapters; so if we consider that the number of chapters for negotiation is 31, in reality there will only remain 3 or 4 chapters per country to negotiate during the second half of this year, and they are final chapters which, as soon as we have a common position on agriculture and as soon as the Treaty of Nice is ratified, we will be able to conclude immediately since they are the institutional chapter and the financial chapter, which can be concluded very easily.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee drawing up the Treaty, which I mentioned earlier, has been working since 13 March on the technical adaptations and the legal details of the commitments agreed so far during the negotiations. We are leaving the Danish Presidency with a good legacy and we are making it possible for them to conclude the drawing up of the Accession Treaty by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Turkey, the Association Committee and Council met in January and April respectively. The most significant element was the adoption of a programme of meetings of the eight sub-committees charged with carrying out the detailed ‘pre-screening’ of its legislation, in accordance with the Laeken mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been insisting on the need to intensify the internal political reforms with a view to full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. Ankara is reiterating its desire to establish in December a date for the start of accession negotiations, but clearly, however much good will it may have, the European Council cannot set dates for the start of negotiations until the Copenhagen criteria have been fully complied with. Our position will be very clear on this. We cannot act in any other way. This is not a case of wishful thinking, but it is an exercise that consists of truly applying the principles which all the institutions are attached to: the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Cyprus, the ordinary negotiations have continued normally; I must say that Cyprus is an excellent candidate, the southern part of Cyprus, the Republic of Cyprus, is certainly the candidate for whom the greatest number of negotiation chapters are concluded and which has made the most progress in the negotiation. Naturally we are still monitoring the development of direct contacts between the leaders of both communities, the conversations which began in January between Mr Denktash and Mr Clerides, which have yet to yield tangible results.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Cyprus myself last Thursday and on behalf of the Presidency I spoke at length with Mr Clerides and with Mr Denktash and we informed them of the Union’s position and of the importance we attach to the programme announced by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the importance of there being an agreement on the core issues, that is, on the issue of forms of government, property, territory and security. Some progress has been made but there have also been some dramatic setbacks in recent days, and therefore I have been there on behalf of the President of the Council, not only to send them a message – a message which will be expressed in some way in the Seville conclusions – but also to listen, so that the northern part of Cyprus can never accuse us of not having been sensitive to their arguments or of not having had time to listen to all their arguments, because, naturally, either party can be either right or wrong, but they each have their views and they deserve to be heard. I therefore believe we have done everything we can to assist the process and we have supported Álvaro de Soto, the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in every way possible. We believe that things have gone well, but we have sent them a very clear message: we know that the objective of June which they had proposed and which the Secretary-General had confirmed has not been complied with, but we have told them that we cannot wait forever and that we need a clear political signal and that, before 24 October, when the Brussels European Council of the Danish Presidency takes place, the Union needs to see this agreement between the two parties, in order to include the whole issue of Northern Cyprus in the mainstream of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Laeken mandate, the Seville European Council must also give its opinion on the report which the Commission is going to present on development and on its action plan for institutionally strengthening the candidate countries, and the General Affairs Council of 17 June will carry out an initial examination of that report, presented by the Commission on the 5th.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in relation to enlargement, the Spanish Presidency introduced for the first time in history the institutional innovation of allowing the candidate countries to participate actively in the Spring European Council – everybody remembers how they participated in the session, not only in the closing dinner, but also in the session itself. That offered the opportunity to visualise the new Union for the first time. We have seen, for the first time, a Council with 25 Members and furthermore within a concrete context that affects all of us and affects them, that is to say the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wanted to refer to the bilateral technical cooperation and assistance which has been carried out and intensified by the Member States with the candidate countries in order to prepare the latter for the application of the Community acquis. Not much is said about this, but we must bear in mind that the progress made, in all the programmes the Commission has implemented, essentially in the twinning programme – which is an extremely important programme, which is really worthy of a debate in this Parliament at some point; and in the ISPA and Sapard programmes there has been spectacular progress both in terms of the Union’s cooperation with these countries, and in terms of the bilateral cooperation of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Given all these factors, and without prejudice to the results of the tour of the Spanish Prime Minister, which is taking place at the moment, we should be able to take the debate on enlargement at the coming Seville European Council much further.</p>
<p class="contents">While waiting for the General Affairs Council to adopt a Resolution, the European Council will examine a note to the Presidency on the state of the negotiations which will serve as a basis for the debate in the European Council. By way of illustration, that project could be based around the following elements: firstly, the recognition of the considerable progress made so far during the various presidencies; we can say that during the Spanish Presidency we have reached a point at which the negotiations are practically finished from a technical point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We have fulfilled the road map and this has allowed the Commission and the Council to bring all 30 chapters with the first ten Laeken countries to the table; the negotiations have entered the final straight. It is now reasonable to expect that the Danish Presidency may, in accordance with the wishes of Parliament and the European Council, conclude the negotiations by the end of December.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, we have now begun to draw up the Accession Treaty and it can now enter a final drawing-up process following the Copenhagen European Council. I do not believe that a fourth period will be necessary, because its drawing-up is now at an advanced stage. The Council will refer to the adoption of common positions both on those chapters pending from previous Presidencies and on those which are more complex in terms of their budgetary implications. Naturally, the specific financial aspects will be looked at at a later date, at the end of the negotiations, as is always the case. We shall reiterate the general principle that any solutions must conform to the current acquis and the Berlin financial framework. Let there be no doubt that this is extremely important. We also require a constructive and realistic approach aimed at concluding the negotiations with the ten candidates so that they can also demonstrate that they are fully prepared to take on their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be an assessment of the report to be presented by the Commission on the development of its action plans for the administrative and judicial strengthening of the candidate countries with a view to effective application of the acquis. In relation to Bulgaria and Romania, we must recognise the significant progress made during this six-month period, reiterate the principle of inclusivity in the enlargement process and commit ourselves to fully supporting their preparation efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Turkey, the European Union should encourage the Ankara Government to intensify its reform efforts and express its conviction that that would help to consolidate its accession ambitions. Meanwhile, the Council would invite the Commission to present concrete measures including, where relevant, additional financial assistance aimed at strengthening the pre-accession strategy for Turkey in line with the rest of the candidate countries. Furthermore, the Council will encourage Turkey to use its influence to promote a speedy solution to the issue of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">And, specifically, on the issue of Cyprus, the European Council will urge the two parties to continue the direct talks between Denktash and Clerides and will encourage them to take this opportunity to find a definitive and global solution as soon as possible, as I said, before 24 October if possible, under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In its capacity as a Member State, a unified Cyprus will have to speak with one voice and this is an issue which we will stress in particular; that is to say, a future shape of the State of Cyprus is something for them to decide, but we have to make something very clear: any type of State that they decide on between the two communities must be a unified State which speaks with one voice and which is able to apply the Community acquis<span class="italic"> </span>in a uniform manner, both in the North and in the South. Of course the European Union, as stated by the Commission, which has set aside additional funds, has committed itself to contributing to the economic development of the northern part of the island, if the negotiations bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from dealing with all these issues, I believe that the European Council must now begin to discuss the new ‘road map’, the political one. In other words, the technical part is finished, or is being finished, and now we must look to the future, to see what will happen in 2003 when everything is concluded, to say what plan we have for the signature and ratification of the Treaty, to send a clear message to the national parliaments that this issue is urgent, to see how the candidate countries can participate in a future Intergovernmental Conference, to see how they can participate in the European Parliament elections, in a nutshell, to see how, in a political sense, all the results of the negotiations can be put into practice in accordance with the programme which we have drawn up and the ideas we have re-affirmed so many times in this House and also in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is a summary of the outlook which is of course approximate, since I cannot anticipate what the Heads of State and Government are going to say. I can only present what the Spanish Presidency is going to put before them. But I believe that, apart from any modifications they might make, this will be in general terms what the European Council will say on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that what I have said on behalf of the Presidency will be a final contribution to the debate in Parliament today on the basis of so many reports, the authors of which – Brok, Böge, Sommer, Turco, Görlach and Olsson – I congratulate on behalf of the Presidency, since they have been extremely useful in terms of clarifying our ideas about what we need to do within the enlargement chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to thank the Commission for the support they have given us at all times, right from the beginning of our Presidency.</p>

The various resolutions to be put to the vote today bear witness once again to Parliament's vital contribution to the quality and pace of the enlargement process and I am grateful for the reliable meeting of minds between Parliament and the Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to thank all the parliamentary rapporteurs for working so constructively with the Commission. I should also like to address a particular word of thanks to your presidents, whose presence in the future Member States is having an encouraging effect and building confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolutions and today's debate mark the end of a very intensive procedure in Parliament over recent months, resulting in a clear 'Yes' to the enlargement strategy and timetable. Our assessment that ten countries will be in a position to conclude negotiations at the end of this year, provided their reforms stay on course, has been confirmed and I am much obliged for the far-reaching consensus in the analysis and conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has called on both sides, the European Union and the future Member States, to make good use of the coming months, to keep up the pace and to mobilise all forces in the sprint to the finishing line, so as to ensure that the jointly set targets are achieved. I would like to join them in that call.</p>
<p class="contents">I have referred on several occasions to the period from 2002 to 2004 as a window of opportunity. A window that is wide open but which could close again if we fail to make good use of the opportunity it offers us. We must not, under any circumstances, throw this opportunity away. Everything we have already achieved is at stake including, last but not least, confidence in both the European Union and the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we are up against a head wind at the moment. A chill has set in, the sceptics agitating against Europe in general and enlargement in particular are becoming more vociferous, feeding on uncertainties, fears and prejudice. My view is that we should join forces to convince the citizens of Europe of the historic need for enlargement and allay their concerns. Since the Iron Curtain fell in Europe and in this globalised world, European integration is the only way to overcome the problems which are making people twitchy and causing them concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is, we need more Europe: for peace and security at home and abroad, for growth and employment, for environmental protection, for the highest possible social standards, for equal opportunities for all. The message must be unequivocal: European integration and enlargement are not the problem, they are a fundamental, inalienable part of the solution. We have the best arguments on our side.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of the past has left a trail of deep wounds and scars behind it. The generation in Europe whose towns were razed to rubble and ashes, who went hungry and experienced the misery of war, flight and persecution, is still alive. It is the generation which suffered under the most violent ideologies of the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the memory of this suffering, however, there is another memory still alive in Europe: the memory of good neighbourly relations, of public-spiritedness, of human decency, of resistance against inhumane systems and of individual bravery. There can be no doubt that, with very different nations living cheek by jowl, all with different memories and ways of life, Europe is a fragile continent. The wounds have closed, to be sure, but the scar tissue is thin and they still ache. The re-opening of the debate on the so-called Beneš decrees has made that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament still has to look at all the legal implications. All I want to say is that the fundamental correlation between this issue and successful enlargement lies in how we talk about it. The debate must be held in a spirit of mutual respect and with respect for everyone's suffering and different experiences. It must be held so that it heals instead of inflicting new wounds. It is precisely because of the tragedies which have marked Europe in very different ways that there is only one reasonable way forward, the way of reconciliation. That is what European unification is all about. Anyone in Europe today who wants to ensure that old wounds are not re-opened, anyone who wants to ensure that no future generation ever has to suffer what earlier generations suffered must stand for a common future, be prepared to look a truth which has many facets in the eye and hold out a hand to integration and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, Parliament and the Commission are agreed: the efforts of the candidate countries to date and the results of the negotiations give us good cause to believe that we shall be able to bring one of the most difficult projects which Europe has undertaken in its whole history to an initial, important conclusion in Copenhagen. We are on schedule. The Spanish Presidency has performed exceedingly well and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Spanish Presidency and Foreign Minister Josep Piqué and my old friend Ramón de Miguel for an unbelievably ambitious presidency. The Spaniards drove us hard – but they are allowed to do that and it is good that they did. That is what the Presidency is there for and the results were worth it.</p>
<p class="contents">As Ramón de Miguel has already mentioned, we have just returned from the latest round of ministerial-level negotiations in Luxembourg. At the end of this round, the state of play is as follows. We are now entering the final round with ten countries. The EU has common standpoints on all the chapters being negotiated, including all the chapters in the financial package, with the exception of agriculture, although in fact there is only one point here on which no agreement has yet been reached and that is the question of direct income support.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that considerable difficulties have now arisen on this question comes as no surprise but they are coming to an end. It is a question of dividing the burden. I think we have to say in all honesty to the citizens of Europe that the enormous political and economic benefits of enlargement come at a price, as the Member States fully recognised in Berlin in 1999. Yes, we are being called on to demonstrate solidarity now and it is in our interest to do so. We need to discuss the costs of enlargement thoroughly, but then, excuse me, we also need to discuss the cost of not enlarging. The message which came out of Luxembourg last Monday has triggered insecurity in the candidate countries. There is no point in denying it. According to the candidate countries, they have been given a promise and they are banking on it. The promise is that, if they meet the conditions, they can accede. Obviously, delays can never be completely ruled out but be warned: we do not want any delays because the Member States cannot agree among themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to add two brief comments. There are two arguments in the current debate, which the Commission cannot accept. The first is that we cannot conclude enlargement negotiations because we do not know what the financial impact will be post 2006. That is an argument that belies a very modest intellectual approach, because it applies to all European Union policies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter, applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is not a single European Union policy, the financial future of which after 2006 is already known to us today. I remember quite clearly what the Presidency had in mind in the first half of 1999 following the outcome in Berlin, namely the unification of the European Union on the basis of the financial conditions for enlargement before 2006. What I want to know is, if we were satisfied with the figures in 1999, why should we no longer be satisfied with the same figures in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to say is that the argument that direct agricultural payments – leaving aside for the moment whether you like them or not – are not a part of Community law, is one that really cannot be taken seriously. You just have to read Community law. It is there in black and white. Passed by unanimous agreement. If you say that direct payments are not a part of European Community law, you might just as well say the moon is blue. You can say it, but it does not change anything.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, 14 technical negotiating chapters have yet to be closed for the first ten countries we hope to sign up in Copenhagen. I am assuming that this number will be even lower by the end of the Spanish Presidency, by which I mean that we shall achieve our target of making sure there are no technical chapters left on the table for the final stage of negotiations. That will be a huge achievement. I am pleased to report that we managed to resolve one of the most difficult and perhaps most important issues in the entire process at this week's accession conference, namely the question of the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania. I must confess I am somewhat surprised at public opinion in Europe. To see how much attention was paid to the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, which is generally considered to be safe, and how little attention was paid to the fact that Lithuania has a Chernobyl-type nuclear power station which represents a danger to both Lithuania and everyone else, and a considerable one … </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, like Chernobyl, a Chernobyl-type nuclear power station.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit: like in the Ukraine!)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, but the Ukraine is not a candidate country and I have no opportunity to exert any influence on the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">What we were looking to do here was to get rid of this Chernobyl-type nuclear power station during the course of the enlargement process. This is an incredible achievement on the part of Lithuania, because this nuclear power station is about as important to the Lithuanian economy as the automobile industry is to Germany. I think that Lithuania deserves a great deal of recognition for the courageous and far-reaching decision which it has taken in the interest of the whole of Europe and I for one am very, very grateful to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we now need to clarify how many countries we can count on for the final round of negotiations in Copenhagen. This is also crucial for the chapter on institutions. The Commission will submit its appraisal of the situation in October, together with its recommendations as to which candidate countries we should be able to sign up by the end of the year, shortly before the European Council in Brussels. I expect that the European Council in Brussels will then take its decision on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be guided in its proposal solely by the negotiating principles. There will be no political preselection. The only criterion will be whether or not a country really has met the conditions for accession. At the same time, we should also have clarified the financial framework and all the related issues by the time the European Council meets in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">This will ensure that negotiations between October and the beginning of December focus on the few outstanding issues, one being the question of the overall sum in financing. Once this sum has been set, dividing it up between the individual candidate countries and individual policy areas will be more or less a purely mathematical exercise, thanks to the excellent preparatory work carried out under the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and this is closely related to agreement on the overall budget, we need to consider the configuration and size of the budget mechanism already decided in principle under the Spanish Presidency. Thirdly, we must be prepared for individual issues in the agricultural chapter – I am thinking in particular of quotas and direct income support here – to remain on the table right through to the end.</p>
<p class="contents">The months of negotiation ahead of us will be hard work. But I am positive that, with flexibility and political perceptiveness, reasonable solutions can be found. But I should like to take this opportunity to state quite clearly that the conclusions of the European Council meetings in Gothenburg and Laeken cannot be interpreted to mean that the European Union will not agree on its common standpoints until Copenhagen; the conclusions of Gothenburg and Laeken can only be interpreted to mean that actual negotiations with the candidate countries will be completed in Copenhagen, so that, as the European Parliament hoped, they can accede in time to take part in the European elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ramón de Miguel has already referred to Bulgaria and Romania on behalf of the Spanish Presidency. I can confirm what he said. Both countries still need more time to meet the accession criteria. Which is precisely why they need a clear signal that they have not missed the boat in Copenhagen. The Commission will therefore submit proposals to improve and strengthen the accession strategy for the countries which will be unable to sign up in 2002. Where possible, we should push ahead with negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and mobilise additional help.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, it is clear – as expected – both from the most recent progress report and from your resolutions that correct application is the biggest obstacle in the candidate countries on the road towards the Copenhagen criteria. In most candidate countries, the cause of these difficulties is rooted in their past and in the difficult transformation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, the Commission proposed mobilising additional funds and announced action plans in order to provide better support for candidates. A report on the action plans on administrative and judicial capacities, adopted by the Commission on 5 June, will be tabled at the European Council in Seville. The report states quite clearly, without pulling any punches, which areas in the candidate countries still show signs of weakness which need intensive work in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also say at this point, however, that the report also clearly states what complex and differentiated instruments for analysis, verification and control of administrative developments and legal practice have been developed in the candidate countries. No other candidate even came anywhere close in earlier enlargement rounds. Never have candidates been so thoroughly tested. Never before was a prospective Member State exposed under such a harsh light to the critical eyes of one and all. I think I can also say that never before has a future Member State been better prepared for its new role. Which is another reason why the current enlargement round cannot be compared with previous rounds. We are making very high demands.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach, however, has borne considerable fruit and has set standards in the candidate countries themselves. If we keep on working here, and the Commission has proposed that we do so to accession and beyond, it will have lasting effects which may even act as an incentive in the present-day EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Commission reports on preparations by candidates, on technical assistance, on institution building, on twinning, on monitoring and control instruments etc. are not of any particular interest to the public. But woe betide if we were to dispense with these efforts! In fact, the credibility of the entire process is at stake here. We want to be sure that all avoidable risks are pre-empted.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the negotiations and tasks which are the preserve of the candidate countries, there is homework which we still have to do. We still have to ratify the Treaty of Nice. We have known that for a long time. The European Council in Barcelona confirmed once again that the Treaty must take effect. But, unlike many observers, my money is on the Irish experience of integration, on Irish support for European integration, on the knowledge that the integration of Ireland has made development possible which nobody dared hope for thirty years ago. The point is, will the countries of central and eastern Europe be able to catch up as Ireland has done. That will be decided during the second referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we lose sight of the fact on our way to Copenhagen that enlargement will bring important partners in eastern Europe closer to home. In future, the EU will border on Byelorussia and the Ukraine, as well as Russia. In a few years' time, we shall be neighbours with the Republic of Moldavia. It is the Commission's stated objective to make full use of the positive effects of enlargement and to further the development of democracy and the market economy in the countries destined to become our future neighbours and we have created the foundations for this by developing a strategic partnership with Russia and the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">However the results of the last EU-Russia Summit did not only fill me with joy, mainly because discussions in Moscow on Kaliningrad were confined to the overland transit problem, a question which concerns not just the EU, but Lithuania and Poland also. As you know, Russia is calling for visa-free access rules; however, Poland and Lithuania have rejected this, as do Parliament and the Commission. The European Union will decide its final position here at the European Council in Seville. But I will say that the real problem of the geographical location of Kaliningrad is how the European Union and Russia can join forces to ensure that the situation in Kaliningrad improves and the area can profit significantly in the long term from the development of its neighbours. I would be delighted if we could start an intensive dialogue with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody is indifferent to the public's opinion on enlargement. It depends on a great deal, on information, on presentation, on our ability to give convincing answers. We know that from our own political experience, which is why the Commission started a communication initiative, with the support of the European Parliament, for the Member States and the candidate countries alike, an implementation report on which will be presented to the European Council in Seville. But here too we must be honest. Commission, Parliament, Council, we can all do a great deal. But there is no substitute for the effort needed by towns and communities, regions and Member States, the economy and science, art and culture. Recent surveys have shown that there is still an information deficit on enlargement, which is why I urgently call on you to engage in conversation with our citizens, to answer their questions and allay their fears wherever this has still not been done. Our strategy is the right one and has already had impressive results.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to enlargement and European integration as a whole. We also have to stand up for this Europe outside the institutions. Risks and problems must not be swept under the carpet. But, the fact remains that the greatest risk to the future peace and security of Europe, which is what we all want, the greatest risk would be to miss this historic opportunity to unite our continent because our courage failed us at the last minute.</p>

I think that as Parliament, we must attach great importance to ensuring that appropriate pressure is brought to bear. As Mr Ramón de Miguel has rightly pointed out, a solution must be found in agriculture too, since there will be no chances later. There is no excuse for delays.</p>
<p class="contents">This also applies in many other areas which the Commissioner mentioned, such as institutional issues. We must put our house in order, whether this is achieved through the ratification of the Treaty of Nice or by other means. This is the homework which we have to do. Whether or not it involves a common position in the Council on agricultural policy, budgetary issues or institutional issues, we have an obligation in this regard. This must not be used as a reason for delaying the enlargement process, for this would meet with incomprehension in the accession countries. We cannot allow a further delay which is due to our own failings. Similarly, of course, we must assess the accession candidates by what they have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand at present, we have thirteen candidate countries; we are negotiating with twelve of them, and ten have a chance of concluding the negotiations this year. In my view, we should thus be in a position to conduct the negotiations in a way which makes this possible. That means – as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy makes very clear in its report – that we must not invent any new conditions, whether they are imposed either by the European institutions or by the Member States. The basis for negotiations is the acquis communautaire, not whatever else might be desirable. We cannot make additional demands. These can only be formulated in a political process which involves the future Member States; they cannot be a condition for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes we must conduct our debates in this house in frank terms as well. When I look at some of the motions tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, they are all very commendable, like some of the other motions. I can even endorse them politically. However, they have absolutely no relevance to the theme of "negotiations on the adoption of the acquis communautaire". The only issue of relevance is the acquis communautaire. If the environment chapters are closed, for example, we should not reopen them because we think that a particular road or canal should not be built in a particular country, which is the thrust of some of these motions, if my analysis is correct. In my view, we ourselves should be precise, honest and coherent here so that progress is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this approach, however, this also means that the accession candidates must understand that each individual country will be assessed on its own merits to determine whether it is able to fulfil the conditions. We recognise that ten of them have the chance to do so. We also recognise that they are in a position to achieve the smooth functioning of the internal market, fulfil the political criteria and achieve legislative compliance with the acquis communautaire at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also, though, have to look very carefully at which countries are able to guarantee judicial and administrative compliance by 2004 when accession takes place. This is a key issue. On these issues, too, no political discounts can be granted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that this is accepted and enforced appropriately. In the same way, we have a request – for it can be no more than that – to countries which will be part of the first round. We would ask them not to take an 'I'm all right, Jack' attitude once they are part of the European Union. In other words, they must not take the view that the boat is full after their accession and possibly veto other countries which are scheduled to join in the second round. We should also ensure, in political terms, that candidates which are not part of the first round do not face additional hurdles.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which is the committee responsible for this policy field, is deeply concerned about a number of problems. We see that in some areas, minority issues have still not been resolved. Corruption and organised crime are still major problems. We attach priority to compliance with the Schengen criteria, because it is also important to make clear to our own citizens that no additional insecurity is being created here. In my view, we must also recognise that Kaliningrad must not be a reason for enlargement to fail. However, we must also recognise that the sovereignty of Poland and Lithuania must be accepted, and that an alternative solution must be found, for I see the corridor option as being unacceptable for both legal and historical reasons. There are so many practical ways of satisfying Russia's justified concerns. I believe that here, too, we will find an appropriate solution, just as I believe, on a general note, that only Members of the European Union and the various accession candidates have a right to decide who should join the EU. This is my response to the Cyprus issue as well.</p>
<p class="contents">When we discuss issues of discrimination etc. in relation to enlargement, we must also ensure that it is made clear that all citizens of this European Union are equal. There must be no discrimination, either against nationals of EU states or against citizens living in the European Union. This is the only aspect of the debate about the Beneš decrees which interests me. Our task is not to examine the past from a legal perspective, but to ensure that no discrimination arises as a result of the current application of the law. I believe that this should be possible for a country under the rule of law, and if my reading of the Verheugen-Zeman paper is correct, I see opportunities to achieve openings and agreements here too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I support your positions on this issue wholeheartedly, for this is a matter of historical significance. I would also like to endorse what was said before. There is no attempt to use issues of history as new combat instruments in the European Union; instead, we must ensure that we learn from history to prevent the suffering, expulsions, murders and wars which occurred in the past from ever happening again, and we must capitalise on the unique opportunity afforded to us through the unification of our entire continent. From the Coal and Steel Community to European integration, the goal has always been to end the cycle of violence, not to settle old scores. The cycle of violence in Europe must cease once and for all. The objective is not to abolish the nation-state – the nation-state will retain its identity – but to water it down in such a way that it is never again able to wage war against others. This is why the legal order established by the European Union is our continent's future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Murphy (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to thank the Council for the diligent way it has pursued this complicated dossier and most especially Commissioner Verheugen and his staff for the phenomenal amount of work they have done on monitoring the progress that has been achieved in the candidate countries. This has actually brought us to this debate here today. Without that effort, we simply would not be in this situation now.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 July 2002 a very famous world sporting event will start. I refer not to the World Cup, the final of which will have been contested between England and Ireland long before 6 July, but to the <span class="italic">tour de France</span>. In many ways the enlargement of the European Union is comparable to the <span class="italic">tour de France</span>. If we were to look at ourselves now we would find ourselves at the last climb, in the mountains, with most of the gruelling race behind us and very much with the finishing line in sight, with the Champs Elysées in Paris waiting for us. We have some tough and difficult climbs to get through at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As anyone who has been on a bicycle knows: if you stop, it falls over. So now is not the time to stop. We have to keep moving forward. The message from my group is very clear, we must keep following that road map. It is a good road map and it will get us through this process. We must stick to the timescale that we have set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">My esteemed colleague, Klaus Hänsch, first raised in this House the date of 2004 as the date for the completion of the first new accession and we must stick to that date. We must allow no new conditions to be introduced. Questions of history are important but questions of history are exactly that, historical questions. Britain and Ireland joined the European Union at the same time, yet the Irish constitution at that time had a claim over British territory. That did not stop us joining this club together. Britain and Spain are still trying to resolve the question of Gibraltar that has gone on for three centuries. These are important historical issues but they are not conditions for accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who use issues of history to try and create new obstacles on our road to the accession of new Member States of the European Union must appreciate the damage that they are doing to public opinion. I was in Prague recently where there has been a 6% fall in public support for joining the European Union just as a result of the debate over the Beneš decrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the Parliament are doing their work. We will rigorously assess the case of each individual country to make sure that the tough questions are answered and that we do not shirk our responsibilities. When we say we agree to a new country joining, we will have done all the hard work so that our citizens can be assured that this is a safe accession that we can all agree to.</p>
<p class="contents">While I appreciate the work that has been done in the Council, I have to say there is a great worry within this Parliament that it may now be the Council that is starting to drag its feet. The Council often talks a good fight on many issues but sadly, in our experience it is often the Council that finds it the most difficult to take the final decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">While we understand and appreciate that many issues we tackle over the next few months will be very difficult, please do not let us delay. Do not try and negotiate, or re-negotiate, the common agricultural policy in the space of two or three months to get us to October and the Brussels Summit. Do not allow the xenophobes and the anti-Europeans to slow us down. And, for heaven's sake, do not let us turn around and start blaming you for not actually getting to 2004 on time. Working together, we can achieve this but I have to say in all honesty that we have worries at the moment about when the Council is actually going to deliver on this.</p>
<p class="contents">My one disappointment about the enlargement process is that the passion has gone out of it. At the beginning of the 1990s, we were all passionate about enlarging the European Union, particularly in the accession states. It has now become some sort of pragmatic, technical exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">We, and the people in the gallery here, ought to be more passionate and expectant about the enlargement of the European Union because it is a historical goal which we can all be justly proud of. We need to reintroduce that element so that from Galway to Gdansk and beyond we secure that reunited continent.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1990, Helmut Kohl and François Mitterand made a promise that we would have the enlargement of the European Union completed by the year 2000. We are failing singularly to do that. The finishing line is in sight, this time it is in Copenhagen. It is not Paris, but let us keep the <span class="italic">peloton</span> together. There are many candidate countries that would like to be wearing that <span class="italic">maillot jaune</span>, I think they are all wearing them. The important thing is to make sure we get to Copenhagen as a finishing line, not just another stage on our route to the successful completion of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for a helpful introduction to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteurs for their good work on the reports before us today. I also take this opportunity to welcome to this House the parliamentarians from the Liberal family in the applicant states who are watching this debate from the gallery and have joined us to debate the issues this week. That parliamentarians from Bulgaria and Romania are here today is a welcome reminder that we are negotiating enlargement with 12 applicant states, even if the timescales for accession may differ a little.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us from countries that were not founder members of the European Community remember only too well the anxiety and sense of expectation which surrounded our entry negotiations and the decisions to ratify our application. Coming from a country which had its application vetoed twice, I know of the enduring damage done to perceptions of European integration when a country is rejected. We should bear this in mind in assessing the current applicants. We must recognise that the applicant states have worked hard in recent years to reform their economies and consolidate democracy in order to join the Union. While we expect them to redouble their efforts in the run-up to and after accession, we must also reward those efforts. That is why Liberal Democrats insist that both the criteria and the timetable must be respected. We should not apply stricter standards than for previous enlargements, nor pretend that everything in our own gardens smells sweet.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam. There are hotheads and faint hearts on both sides who will seek to exploit difficulties in meeting the Copenhagen criteria. We must not allow them to derail enlargement. It is far better to overcome outstanding problems through the enlargement process. What is important to the health of a country is the direction in which its face is set and the screening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be an ongoing process, part of a wider scrutiny of all Member States – old and new – in a European Union with the Charter of Fundamental Rights at its heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats deplore the abuse of enlargement negotiations to reopen old wounds and animosities. The infamous Beneš decrees are a good example of this. It serves no useful purpose to inflame tensions on this issue, which is why my group has tabled amendments to Mr Brok's report to seek to lower the temperature of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The refusal of four governments – including Mr Murphy's – at the General Affairs Council this week to reach agreement on a common position on agriculture stems in part from the inadequacy of the financing package agreed in Berlin. We are constrained to live within Berlin's limits, but if a deal is postponed until autumn – as some propose – this would jeopardise the prospect of admitting new Member States in time for the European Parliament elections in 2004. We support the Commission's proposals to phase-in direct payments but, as soon as enlargement is agreed, we must take forward reform of the CAP. We need to shift the focus away from the producer onto the consumer, from quantity to quality.</p>
<p class="contents">On the controversial issue of free movement of persons, I urge all Member States to follow the lead of Denmark, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands, which have said they will apply no restrictions to free movement. There are no rational grounds for believing that enlargement will be followed by the mass migration sometimes feared by our citizens. It is precisely these fears which we, as politicians, have to tackle head on. We have a responsibility to make the case for enlargement to our electorates and we must not shrink from that challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the report to be voted on tomorrow will give the green light to enlargement. The historic prospect beckons of a wider, stronger Union – a bulwark for freedom and democracy in an uncertain world. Let ours not be the generation which flunks this opportunity.</p>

It is exciting, it is fantastic, but this window of opportunity also implies a need to carry out reforms. If we do not do so for enlargement, we shall be placing Europe at risk. We shall run the risk of producing a chaotic Europe which will place enlargement at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Mr President, do not tell us that the principle of direct payments to agriculture is fair, because it is an unjust principle and it must be reformed. That does not mean that it is not necessary to help farmers, but it means that we must have structural aid for rural development, that we must follow a policy of sustainable agriculture, something which we have not done for years. We failed to reform agriculture in Berlin. We failed. We failed to carry out the reforms. That does not mean that we are against enlargement, quite the contrary, but we must make the granting of aid subject to certain social and ecological conditions, which we are not doing.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that we should spend less money. We had a financial framework in Berlin, and we reduced it. We could invest in the countries which are applying for accession, but we have not done so, because of the selfishness of the rich countries of the European Union such as Germany, France or Spain. Everyone says that they are in favour of enlargement, but when it comes to paying the price of solidarity, political selfishness rears its head. We are not telling lies here. These are the difficulties which you will come up against in Seville, the same difficulties that we encountered in Berlin on the subject of fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The thing that annoys me, frankly, is that everyone says yes to enlargement, but when it comes to paying the necessary price of solidarity, in other words the price of implementing reforms to the way in which the European Union functions, then we are much more pedestrian than in our historic, Sunday-best speeches. I do not want enlargement to be a political undertaking reserved for Sunday-best speeches, while on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday we pursue a policy which is opposed to enlargement. That is why I say, and why I defend the idea, that in the window of opportunity described by the Commissioner, there is no mention of the need to complete the necessary reforms of the European Union so that the enlargement of the Union to twenty-seven countries can be made to work.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we, the Greens, are defending, because we are keen supporters of enlargement, and keen supporters of internal reforms to the European Union, so that enlargement can work. That is our task, and we have not yet completed it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports before us and the speeches by Members do not draw a veil over the unresolved issues, but do endorse the candidate countries' accession. Our group also supports this position. The current state of play in the negotiations and in the adoption of the acquis communautaire implies that there are no alternatives. Yet if we look at the quality of integration and the problems arising in the EU itself, it is possible to arrive at a different view.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, for example, does not believe it is right that, as part of the accession process, candidate countries are urged to join the NATO military alliance. This should not be part of the process, which involves accession to the EU and nothing else.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU sets conditions for the accession candidates which are not fulfilled by many of its own Member States. There is a tremendous backlog of reform in the EU. The willingness to show solidarity in the distribution of resources is far from overwhelming, and citizens' support for accession has recently been on the wane. Ascribing these problems to ignorance and a lack of transparency is, in our opinion, too simplistic. The citizens' debate on Europe which was called for after Nice has yet to take place in any meaningful way, while the burdens associated with the pre-accession adaptation process are becoming increasingly onerous.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports quite rightly call upon the candidate countries to adopt more rigorous anti-corruption measures. What is never mentioned, however, are the causes and sources of corruption, which is due, among other things, to capitalist privatisation and the growing social inequalities between a handful of increasingly wealthy people and the vast majority who face poverty and unemployment. The lack of impact of the Commission's strategic positions in the accession process is particularly apparent in agriculture. Anyone who warned early on that some of the elements contained in Agenda 2000 were quite unrealistic was criticised as a troublemaker, but the much-vaunted open 5% have negative and disproportionate repercussions on farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet anyone who assumes that, with the exception of agricultural policy, the process of enlarging the EU by up to ten states has been resolved is naïve, in my view. Social inequality is present to a far greater extent. There is very limited willingness to show solidarity, and in many areas, the Commission's work is much too superficial and bureaucratic to do justice to the new demands of integration. A considerable number of key issues are unresolved, and what is required is a change of direction. I hope that this will be achieved in good time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The concerns voiced here, however, although, it is true, expressed by confirmed believers in the historic importance of the enlargement process and strategy, relate to the apparent haziness of the situation surrounding the process itself. To be sure, almost all the candidate countries have put up a commendable performance in developing their legal systems and economies quickly. In any case, respect for the Copenhagen criteria and assimilation of the Community acquis – which, however, we feel should be interpreted in general terms – are compulsory. However, what we do not fully understand, less than two years off the first wave of entries, is whether the final decision will depend on practical results or whether it will be affected by the pseudopolitical, not to say paternalistic attitudes which have reared their heads, which are not indicative of the great overall willingness to cooperate which the Union ought to be showing.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is not clear what the result of the entry of – presumably 10 – countries in 2004 will be, in the sense that we do not know what impact the overspending on the part of four countries will have on the current financial planning and therefore on the treatment that will be reserved for the new Member States. Certainly, a sure response needs to be given at least with regard to the size of the Structural Funds commitments that will be set aside for them in the short- and long-term future, not least to give them time to find responses to the respective problems of social and economic cohesion which are emerging in some of those countries and develop an effective social and employment policy and a code of good practice for undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">Border security, respect for minors, civil rights, the own-resources funding system and an effective judicial system are certainly extremely important, but it is equally important for each of the candidate countries to involve its citizens in the process, to provide them with the right information and to be able to convince them that it is worth making temporary sacrifices now as an investment for future prosperity, if this last is actually the object of the exercise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with the Brok report, we would underline the strategic goal of this historic process, namely a peaceful and prosperous co-existence of the peoples in our Continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already brought to your attention the fact that a primarily financial approach to enlargement does not do justice to its importance and character. Hence my appeal to the Member States not to raise any new obstructions in respect of enlargement. This appeal includes the demand to review the agricultural policy prior to enlargement. However, when a common position is adopted on the agricultural chapter, a fair prospect is required for both the candidate countries and the current net payers. Net receivers could show – more so than is the case at the moment – financial solidarity with the future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 8 of the Brok report is being slightly over-demanding of the candidate countries. It is downright unrealistic to expect the governments in central and eastern Europe to have resolved the extremely complex Roma issue by the end of this decade. This, of course, does not detract in any way from the appeal for a liveable situation, where the Roma have their own responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are now discussing the political criteria of Copenhagen, I should like to ask Commissioner Verheugen another question.

<p class="contents">There are two particularly delicate problems which arise with regard to agriculture. First of all there is the opening up of the markets of the West to the products of the East. This opening up has to be conducted industry by industry and country by country, as and when producers are in a position to place on the market products which meet the same quality and safety criteria as those that we already impose on our own producers. The second issue is that of the first pillar of the CAP, in other words market support and compensatory aid. Here it is necessary that the principles which govern the CAP, the aid and support which are justified by the environmental, social and health constraints and requirements which our farmers are bound by, should be applied, without discrimination, to both old and new Member States, as long as the latter observe the same constraints. How long will it take before they are able to do so? In other words, how long should the transitional period be? The Commission is proposing a totally uniform transitional period for all countries, as far as the timetable and implementing rules are concerned, which would result, first of all, in an extremely brutal and painful restructuring operation for those countries which have a large number of agricultural holdings. It seems to us, on the contrary, that this question should be answered on a country-by-country basis, taking into account the special situation and specific structure of farming in each country, as well as the social impact of their suddenly finding themselves in the CAP and the speed which is desirable, desired and bearable for each country’s farming sector.</p>
<p class="contents">To tackle this problem solely from an accounting point of view, which is what certain Member States, such as Germany and the Netherlands, tend to do at present, shows a narrowness of approach which is dangerous to the future of the Union, because these are essential issues for the future and the equilibrium of societies in the applicant countries. The enemy of the Greater Europe of the future, Mr President, is the desire for uniformity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously accession to the European Union is open to only one Cypriot State as far as international law is concerned. That means that the representatives of the two communities on the island will have to agree on a constitutional formula which will enable the new Member State to participate in the decision-making process and to assume all its obligations under Community law. Only a federal model, in other words the model which is recommended in the United Nations Security Council Resolutions, fulfils this objective. Any theories based on the existence of two sovereign States which would be linked together by a vague treaty of partnership rather than via a solid, democratic and freely accepted constitution, would give rise to fictitious and inoperable structures which would be unacceptable from the legal viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now entering into the final stretch of the negotiation process. The current window of opportunity, the opportunity to resolve a forty-year old conflict, will close at the end of this month. I should like to emphasise here that it is precisely the European dimension which provides the opportunity to transcend the old quarrel about sovereignty. Jean Monnet said that in order to change the facts of a problem it was enough to change its framework. As the rapporteur, I hope that the negotiators will find, in the words of Jean Monnet, the inspiration for a final effort. If not, the Republic of Cyprus would be admitted by the European Council of Copenhagen on the same terms as the other candidate countries. Cyprus fulfils all the required conditions, and has now completed twenty-four of the thirty-one chapters of the accession negotiations. There is therefore no doubt but that it will form part of the first wave of accessions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, the Czech Parliament's declaration of 24 April 2002 is helpful, since it states that the presidential decrees cannot be the basis for any new legal relations today. However, there is one issue which concerns us, and that is whether discriminatory elements still exist in current Czech law, such as an act dating from 1992 on the restitution of property confiscated from its owners under Communism, which makes the restitution of property contingent on continuous Czech citizenship. We must establish whether this provision conforms with European law. The same applies to what is known as the 1946 Criminal Indemnity Act. In addition to clarifying these and other issues, a number of other problems will arise even after Czech accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that a clear signal from those who were expelled in 1945 and from their descendants would be helpful. This signal should make it clear that the property relations which emerged after the Second World War are inviolable, and should not be violated. If this signal were sent out, Czech fears could be assuaged, and people who are currently consumed by these fears could use their energies productively to prepare the Czech Republic for EU accession in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Europe constitute the most important issue in my political work. As rapporteur where Estonia is concerned, it feels good to be able to note that, finally, we shall now soon be there. Estonia, which has closed 26 of 31 chapters, has fulfilled all the necessary conditions for becoming a member of the EU in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Estonia shows how quickly a country which has freed itself from a long occupation and has restored democracy has also succeeded in completely reorienting its policies and building up a strong, market-oriented economy with well functioning institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Estonian economy has produced fantastic results, and 4.5% growth is anticipated this year. The Estonian kroon has been tied to the Deutschmark and, subsequently, the euro for almost ten years. When Estonia joins the EU, I hope that the country will continue its work in favour of less bureaucracy and better basic conditions for businesses. Estonia also has a belief in the future and a capacity for change that are needed by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Swedish Presidency, the Social Democratic Government spoke proudly of its timetable for enlargement. We do not, however, build the EU with plans alone. Timetables presuppose action. That is why it is disgraceful that Sweden is now putting the timetable at risk and making enlargement conditional upon agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural policy is actually being reformed, albeit modestly, and it is important that there should be radical changes. As the Council representative pointed out, those countries which are now using the agricultural chapter to delay the work on enlargement are assuming a big responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be nothing more important than that the EU honour its pledges and that the last chapter in the reunification of Europe be written in Copenhagen this autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to express my congratulations to all those who have the privilege of working in the EU’s different institutions and to express my thanks for some very close cooperation in the course of the last few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a sign of encouragement at this crucial time when the Commission, the Council and the Member States, as well as the candidate countries, are preparing to open negotiations on the chapters which are most complex and which have the greatest budgetary implications. We cannot ignore the fact that the chapters on agriculture and regional policy and financial and budgetary considerations alone account for 80% of the Community budget. This was certainly what led the Commission prudently to propose a system of gradual implementation for the direct aid paid to farmers under the CAP and for the allocation of structural funds to the new Member States. We are in no doubt that it was similar reasons that led some of the current Member States to call for a thorough restructuring of the CAP as a prerequisite for reaching<span class="italic"> </span>a common EU starting position for negotiations on the agricultural chapter<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">If we add to this the – to us obvious – need to continue to uphold the policy of economic and social cohesion between the current Member States, because otherwise enlargement could conceivably exacerbate existing disparities within the Union, it is easy to understand the words spoken on this matter this morning as a warning by the President-in-Office of the Council, Ramón de Miguel. The planning stage is over. Where enlargement is concerned, real political planning has begun.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the most significant landmark in Hungary’s current political situation has undoubtedly been the legislative elections held in April. In a coalition with the Liberal Party, the Socialist Party achieved a victory which gave it 198 seats in Parliament, as opposed to the 188 won by the party of the previous government. It seems certain that the change of government will not affect Hungary’s strategic objective of joining the European Union. The winning parties have always maintained this aspiration. Nevertheless, and bearing in mind the differences of opinion between the previous government and the election-winners on a whole range of issues, such as the Status Law, social dialogue and public procurement for example, the possibility of changes in Hungary’s position on the accession process cannot be excluded, although I do not believe that they will jeopardise this process. From the economic point of view, Hungary is maintaining a viable market economy and its economic performance is one of the best in the region. Furthermore, Hungary has to date closed 24 chapters and has made more progress in negotiations than almost any other candidate country. On the chapter dealing with culture and the audiovisual field, I am pleased to see that the government and the opposition have finally reached agreement on the representation of parliamentary parties on the Media Council – covering radio and television – which means that we will soon be able to close this chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope – and we do hope – that the shortcomings seen in the field of public procurement will also be remedied and that the rules of competition will, at last, be fully complied with in the areas covered by this major market. The announcement that anonymous deposits, even already existing deposits, are to be abolished, starting in the next few days, is also very much to be welcomed. The adoption of such a measure demonstrates the consistency of the Hungarian authorities’ initiatives to combat corruption and money-laundering. It is this progress, of which I have given only a brief overview, and the trend that it reveals, which give us continuing grounds for optimism that the negotiations for Hungary’s accession to the European Union will be concluded within the deadline that has been set and, consequently, that we will see its 22 Members in this House for the next legislature in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the Commissioner's view, and above all his concern, that it is apparently the Member States' failure to recognise their responsibility which is causing the project to founder. Have the Member States only just realised that these problems in agriculture would arise, and that a solution must be found, first and foremost, by the European Union? Do you really not realise that delays in the timetable are grist to the mill of nationalist forces and actually encourage their emergence in these countries? I therefore call on all the democratic movements here in this House, in the Member States and in the candidate countries to ensure that this major and historic project, which so many people in Europe have worked so hard to achieve, does not fall into the hands of election propagandists.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just had an opportunity to see for myself how difficult it was to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria item by item in Latvia. For historical reasons and due to the great efforts made by Latvia, it would be impossible to explain to the local population that Member States are not prepared to do their homework here. It is clear that the obvious deficiencies in European agricultural policy cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely without a reform. It is also clear that Europe needs a constitution. It is essential that this takes place in parallel to, and does not delay, accession. After all, it was the prospect of enlargement and accession to the European Union which gave the crucial impetus to the reform movements in Europe and encouraged them to embark on a course towards a democratic Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me cite Latvia as an example. Although the majority of its political elite opposed this move, Latvia has amended one of its electoral laws and granted the Russian-speaking community an unlimited right to stand for election. This is accepted as a matter of course in our own countries. Yet in Latvia, this was a highly sensitive issue, just as agricultural policy is for us. So if Latvia can do it, why can not we? This comparison may not seem relevant to you, but it is relevant in terms of the candidate countries' expectations. What we expect from them are the qualities which we ourselves should be displaying, namely a willingness to move towards integration, and an enthusiasm for reform. Without constitutional reform and financial solidarity, Europe cannot progress. The tasks to be resolved must be resolved here. We cannot point the finger at the enlargement countries and tell them that they should be doing this and that if we cannot manage to do the same things ourselves. I would certainly recommend that Latvia's accession be planned for the end of 2002, for I am convinced that this country can resolve its remaining problems. The European Commission must also continue with the process of decentralisation and pursue policies which are close to citizens in order to shape this process successfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that this new historic reconciliation, which is good news for all of us, will look to the future and that we shall all dismiss the atavism which has been flying around recently as a mere distraction of no importance whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen a great number of protagonists along the way. The twelve candidate countries, ten of which will join us next year, at least on paper, with the other two, I hope, following on a little later. Along the way, nations have woken up and governments have woken up. However, I should like to highlight the real efforts made by a number of countries. Cyprus tops the league of candidate countries. It has an exemplary economy, an exemplary democracy and its institutions operate in an exemplary fashion. And hopefully, all these developments will help forces which do not operate as positively as they might to resolve regional problems. Malta, that unique Mediterranean island, the only one left which will not be a member of the European Union for some time yet and which we need to treat with understanding and on its own merits.</p>
<p class="contents">Lithuania, for which I have acted as rapporteur. This country has forged ahead in leaps and bounds in resolving the problem of moving from a planned economy to a free market economy. It has made excellent progress on a great many issues. Taking a decision such as the one about the Ignalina nuclear power station which Commissioner Verheugen mentioned earlier takes a great deal of political courage, especially when you know the regional structure of energy networks in the area and how the economy depends on them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two problems: first the usual problem in these countries, that is, agriculture. I trust we shall demonstrate the courage needed and the will needed to ensure these issues do not delay the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the major political issue of Kaliningrad. Clearly, these political issues and other issues in Europe must not listen to the urgings of the past. They must listen to the needs of the future. In this sense, the political wisdom of the European Union will be judged in Kaliningrad; it must be true to itself but must understand that the historic reconciliation reached between the 15, between the 25, the 27 and the 28 countries has to be a factor in continuing historic reconciliation, a Europe of peace, cooperation and development for everyone. A Europe in which we feel at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like all the other accession candidates, not only are specific chapters open, so too, of course, are the major areas of agricultural, regional and budgetary policy. However, economic development has been positive, and the budget deficit has been substantially reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of Malta's alignment with and implementation of Community law, Malta has made substantial progress as regards labour legislation and health and safety in the workplace. In the area of competition, further efforts are needed to strengthen administrative capacity. However, Malta is not alone in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also positive is that Malta has created a suitable legal framework for the development of investments and the restructuring of SMEs. There are still shortcomings in the environmental field and in preparing the structures needed to implement the EU's regional and agricultural policies. However, here too, the European Commission is called upon to respond to Malta's specific agricultural structure, which is based on small farms, its traditional taxation system, or the specific trade conditions resulting from its island status. We should also support Malta's claim to six seats in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Malta's accession process will speed up again in the coming months, and that when the Commission's report is presented on 16 October 2002, Malta will be included as one of the candidates for the first round of accessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should like to comment on the highly sensitive issue of the Beneš decrees. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is pointing out that discriminatory provisions which conflict with the acquis communautaire must be abolished before accession to the European Union, and I hope that after the elections in the Czech Republic, this issue can be resolved in an objective way.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of nuclear safety, I would like to emphasise in particular that the European Parliament should maintain adherence to the closure dates for dangerous and non-upgradable power stations – not only Ignalina, but also Kosloduj and Bohunice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who are familiar with the history of Poland know what corridors mean for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to express one concern in what is, on the whole, a positive picture for Poland, regarding what appear to be clumsy<span class="italic"> </span>attempts on the part of the current left-wing government to influence, or rather to restrict the independence of both the press and television and the National Bank of Warsaw. I trust that the debate currently taking place in Poland on these two key institutions of any democracy will not result in decisions which mar the esteem in which this country is held in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by sharing a further concern with you, which has already been expressed by Commissioner Verheugen, namely that there is resistance to enlargement in the air. There is, in effect, something unhealthy in the air: enthusiasm is waning and the anti-European parties are gathering support everywhere. In my opinion, we really do need to redouble our efforts: it is our duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Slovakia is now, since yesterday, at the top of the list of negotiating countries, which is, given that country’s past, no mean feat. But in the case of Slovakia too, preparations have not yet entirely finished. Judging from the schedule, a great deal of work will need to be done this year. Despite the optimistic note in my report, there are still points of criticism and points that will weigh heavily when this Parliament comes to reaching a final verdict. They are not new and concern in many cases other candidate countries too. They involve the fight against corruption which, in Slovakia, is still too widespread. They also concern improving the government’s implementing capacity, a topic, in fact, to which this Parliament ought to devote a separate debate. In addition, the problems of the Roma should be tackled more swiftly. Also, an effective regional policy should be developed as a means of fighting excessive levels of unemployment in that country. Additionally, effective border control should be implemented in the framework of future Schengen cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of these points, demands are high. We do not want perfection but visible progress towards an average level we have in the current EU. It is precisely the advocates of enlargement, to which, fortunately, also the large majority of this Parliament belongs, who have the responsibility of carefully testing the acceding countries at the end of the journey, on the basis of the criteria formulated in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">In September, parliamentary elections will be held in Slovakia and there is already a great deal of speculation about the outcome. It is up to the Slovakian citizens to decide, but as in 1998, these elections are, in fact, about Slovakia’s future in Europe. I hope that the turn-out will be as high as possible, and I expect that the outcome will lead to the forming of a new government that will be able to work with the European Union in a manner that is just as positive as the current government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the current operation – enlargement – the sooner it happens the better. The politicians of the new democracies, although in some cases the public rather less so, are under the impression that outside Europe it is darker and rainier, but many small, developed countries, including Slovenia, are wont to succumb to fears and see complete sovereignty as a way of constraining the globalising force of the strong and the economically aggressive. I hope that the Brok report will help to set them straight and convince them that they are progressing along the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the general issues have already been dealt with and I would therefore like, if I may, just to focus on Slovenia. Ultimately, as far as Slovenia is concerned, there are two sensitive points in particular. Slovenia, considered to be among the best prepared candidate countries, is making every endeavour to complete the adoption of<span class="bold"> </span>the chapters of the European acquis. In practice, however, the problems revealed are the same as those highlighted by other reports. In some sectors, the efforts are yielding the desired results, but there are delays in others. Ljubljana looks set to achieve the four Maastricht criteria on target, reducing inflation, and that is a considerable achievement. There seems to be a certain amount of progress in areas such as the computerisation of the land register and the privatisation of banks, particularly the privatisation of banks, which is an indication of greater openness towards other countries. The computerisation of the land register, on the other hand, should reduce the number of civil court cases attributable to denationalisation. The European Union has been urging Slovenia to speed up the procedures and make good the delays in this field for years now.</p>
<p class="contents">Brussels, for its part, understands Slovenia’s concern that it will enter the Union under unfavourable conditions or even as a net contributor. The support for agriculture, which is not sufficiently long-term, does not provide sufficient reassurance. It would appear that Slovenia’s argument that stable mechanisms need to be found for the Structural Funds, direct payments and so forth is falling on sympathetic ears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead we have the enormous weight of the imposed <span class="italic">acquis</span>, which grows by the day and significant elements of which are ignored even by current Member States, let alone the candidate states.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also hope that the enlargement report before this House will continue to make reference to all 13 candidates for accession. This will enable Turkey's progress to be addressed. I note Mr de Miguel's realistic but encouraging remarks with regard to Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the negotiations for a just, lasting and mutually acceptable settlement of the Cyprus question, which most of us so anxiously desire, are at a very sensitive stage. Both sides must be encouraged to make the necessary compromises to reach such a settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for Bulgaria, I want to commend that country for the steady progress it is making towards EU membership, with its economic successes, its strategies for administrative and judicial reform, for more effectively dealing with the problems of its minorities, for tightening its borders and for fighting corruption. We now need to translate these strategies into more effective action which produces tangible results so that Bulgaria will be in a position rapidly to close all the negotiating chapters with a view to accession in about 2007 or 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a positive outlook, backed up by what must be well targeted, well managed European Union assistance, would help sustain support for modernising governments and reformed public institutions in Bulgaria – support which is frail at the moment. We need to send a positive signal to Bulgaria with a clear road map for accession.</p>

The magnificent efforts by the Prime Minister and his team have created laudable results. NATO membership in Prague this autumn is now a certainty and the impact of that body of work on European Union enlargement will be wholly beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania now stands at the crossroads. It is a European nation, yet European standards and our fundamental values are still not fully adhered to by all levels of society. The government's strong fight against corruption is hampered by lack of financial, human and material resources, with the inevitable knock-on effect of a low absorption rate of EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus new methods are needed to boost Romania's progress in the coming months after the big bang. We must take new initiatives. It is imperative that the newly emerging political map of Europe, with its plague of unhealthy nationalism, does not threaten Romania's entry into the European Union. If the enlargement window of opportunity starts to close, I urge the Union to lead Romania more swiftly through the narrowing gap of full EU membership so that she is not left languishing on the margins.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania should be guaranteed early membership even if some of the acquis communautaire is not wholly complete. Surely we can find an entry date with the aim, say, of completing negotiations by the end of 2006. Surely that is within our grasp. Under Ceaucescu, many hundreds of thousands of Romanians showed incredible courage based on their deepest attachment to our core values of truth, freedom and respect for the human dignity of every individual.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall that in Bucharest in 1990 the main streets were dark, unlit and the only vehicles were driven by the secret police. Last week those same streets were alive and buoyant with a massive international trade with traffic jams, shops and offices, and the bustle of normal life. Romania's bloodless revolution has brought her through into the free world. She still has some way to travel to be with us here today but exceptional efforts surely deserve exceptional responses.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commission, with Romania's people, the primary architects of the country's success, for bringing her to that level of integration today. I look for new thinking and creative achievements in the months ahead to give Romania the tools she needs to finish the job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE-DE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the Committee on Budgets' point of view, we want to send out two signals to the Council, the Commission, the European public and the accession countries today. Firstly, we want to make clear our desire to put the budgetary conditions in place so that enlargement can go ahead in 2004, involving up to ten candidate countries. Secondly, we want to make it very clear to the Commission and the Council that according to Paragraph 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement and on the basis of Article 272, the adjustment of the financial perspective is undertaken on the proposal of the Commission together with Parliament and Council, namely with a qualified majority in the Council and, in Parliament, a majority of its Members and three-fifths of the votes cast. Let me add that everyone involved should work towards ensuring that the outcome is capable of securing a majority in both the current EU and the new Member States. This is a major challenge and obligation for us.</p>
<p class="contents">The original financial perspective contains an indicative financial framework, initially for six new countries from 2002. However, this framework should serve as a basis for the negotiations, so that the decisions taken in Berlin, Agenda 2000 and the acquis communautaire might be adhered to. Based on the plenary's decisions of September 2001, we greatly welcome the approach involving progressive integration in agricultural and structural policy, simply taking account of the pre-accession experience, budget discipline, and WTO rules, but also the candidate countries' own domestic situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the fact that the agricultural subsidies available to the new Member States are to be increased to reach the level of 100% of direct aid by 2013. It is clear that if necessary, we must start discussing the European Union's development after 2006 today. Will the financial perspective be extended or revised? What will happen in agricultural policy and the structure of direct payments, rural policy, and society's new demands regarding international competitiveness and the WTO? Then there is the issue of introducing a comprehensive reform of the structural fund mechanisms due to the experience of absorption, the simplification of procedures, greater consideration of local conditions – all this is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take up what the Presidency has said: let us not overburden the accession negotiations, and let us stop and think for a moment. Taking decisions today for the period after 2006 also means anticipating the recommendations of the Convention on the future of the European Union. In my view, this is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The simplified model of direct payments in agriculture, and the concept of special financing arrangements via a Fund which is defined and managed separately from the Cohesion Fund, offering very favourable conditions to the new Member States, is the right approach. However, let me add this: alongside improved utilisation of structural fund resources in the accession countries, the possibility of phasing out the special conditions must also be discussed. In particular, we wish to endorse the comments made by Mr Verheugen in connection with aid to the new Member States, especially as regards improving administrative capacities and the closure of nuclear power stations, with specific closure criteria being a precondition for this aid.</p>
<p class="contents">New Member States will also entail new external borders. This means new partners on the EU's external borders, which will raise new issues concerning cross-border cooperation and the European Union's foreign policy. It has also implications for heading 4 of the budget, and we therefore wish to be consulted on these issues at an early stage. The provision of budgetary compensation to the accession countries through a lump sum on the expenditure side of the budget, which should be temporary and degressive, in order to prevent any new Member State being a net contributor during the first years, is something which we would certainly support. Naturally, the fact that the administrative costs may reach the upper limit stated in the financial perspective is a cause for concern, and we will have to look at whether we are in a position to abide by this limit by streamlining work processes and competences or whether we have to accept what the Commission has defined as additional costs of some EUR 500-600 million in this area during the first years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention one very important point. If there are any net contributors who believe that we should already be setting a framework for the period after 2006 in all policy areas, I should like to remind them that a new financial perspective, whatever form it might take, must ultimately be decided on the basis of unanimity. This makes it clear that in the future, too, based on the Commission's proposals for the enlargement process, we have the opportunity to maintain budget discipline while having a responsibility to achieve a balance in this negotiating process and find a solution which is in the interests of the current Member States but also takes account of the equally justified interests of the accession countries. Let us all get to work to achieve this outcome.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming enlargement which is the subject of our debate today naturally poses a unique challenge to the European Union. The number of Member States will virtually double. The EU's population will increase by almost 50%. What will not increase substantially, however, is the Gross Domestic Product of this new enlarged EU. It will only rise by about 10%. The prosperity gap between the current EU, with its fifteen Member States, and the accession states is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">This enlargement will entail major burdens for us all. Nonetheless, we all agree that these burdens are immaterial in light of the historic opportunity afforded to us to unite Europe in peace and democracy and in political and economic stability. Yet already, many of our regions bordering candidate countries are experiencing a foretaste of enlargement. It is precisely these border regions which will face tremendous problems in the wake of enlargement. They will bear the brunt of enlargement for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">These border regions need our solidarity. We must help them to cope with this difficult situation. Certainly, not all the border regions are the same. Some of them are prospering more than others. Nonetheless, many of them have been in decline for some time. These regions have been on the absolute periphery for decades; indeed, from our perspective, they are almost at the edge of the world. It is not a particularly attractive situation, and this is reflected in the fact that many of them are still areas covered by Objective 1. They still have a major deficit compared with the EU average.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the key features of the situation in these difficult border regions? High unemployment, a lack of prospects and even resignation, the drifting away of young people, inner city decline, decaying villages in rural regions, and a resulting loss of infrastructure – for no one contemplates expanding the road network if it seems that no one uses it any more. These regions' loss of infrastructure, their loss of quality of life and their declining attractiveness and quality as a location for industry create a vicious circle. Then there is the competition from the accession regions on the other side of the border, which are quite rightly pushing westwards. It is a fact that the borders have been semi-permeable for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not necessarily a fair competition, for we all know that the prosperity gap is wide between these neighbouring regions on either side of the border. It results in major differences in the cost of living and in labour and social costs, as well as highly disparate environmental standards, which are likely to continue for some time. This situation substantially distorts competition. It is particularly difficult for small and medium enterprises in the trades and service sectors, which is why, in my report, I have focussed especially on support for SMEs in the border regions. Indeed, I would have liked to set up a separate budget line for this area in order to guarantee that the support genuinely reaches its target. However, I was forced to recognise that this was unlikely to be supported by a majority in this House, for of course it is quite correct that setting up a new funding instrument takes a great deal of time, and time is running out for these SMEs. They need assistance urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore abandoned my idea and agreed that the well-established, tried and tested funding instruments such as Interreg should be used instead. In the end, I also had the impression that the Commission recognises the urgent need for strong support to SMEs in these problematical border regions. We ourselves should also recognise the need for short-term transitional measures relating to the freedom to provide services and the free movement of workers. What is needed, please, is a gradual opening and a cautious approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, therefore, I do not support the amendments before us which dispute that these measures are necessary. Incidentally, it is also important to stress that we are focussing on our border regions very late in the day, and that the financial resources available are completely inadequate. This is described in my report as well. It would be unfair to use the lion's share of these meagre resources to expand the Trans-European Networks. These TENs are in Europe's general interest. They are only of limited benefit to the border regions. In the border regions, what is required are regional transport links and, in particular, cross-border transport services. There is virtually nothing available at present. The measures which we are now initiating through this Community action for border regions are really only a start, a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recognise that dismantling the existing deficits is likely to take several generations, and so further measures must follow. Of course, the border regions are now moving to the heart of Europe, and this naturally offers them great opportunities for the future. There is a chance for them to become a model of best practice for European regional cooperation, that is true, but this is likely to take many years. Until then, we must help them. Let us send out a signal and endorse this report by a broad majority in this House. Let us send out a signal to the citizens living in these difficult regions that we are not sacrificing them to the enlargement process, and that we are not abandoning them. Instead, we are taking them by the hand to progress together towards a positive future.</p>

The report of which I am the rapporteur examines three annual reports by the Commission relating to the year 2000: the report on the Structural Funds, the report on the Cohesion Fund and the report on the Instrument for Structural Policy for Pre-Accession. If Commissioner Barnier, the Commissioner responsible for regional policy, were here, I would have read him what he said before this House during the year 2000, but he is not here so I will not bother with that.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2000 was the first year in which the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund interventions laid down by the 1999 regulations was actually implemented. In the light of the report by the Commission itself and both the annual and special reports of the Court of Auditors, we have noted that the simplification and speeding-up of implementing procedures for structural measures promised by the Commission in Agenda 2000 and implemented through the adoption of new regulations did not have any effect. As was pointed out, again by the Commission, with regard to the rates of implementation of the Structural Funds objectives overall, there were delays similar to those recorded in 1994. It was only thanks to the 7% advance and automatic annual commitment that it was possible to attain rates of implementation of 13% for commitments and 5% for payments. If we consider the objectives, Community initiatives and innovative measures as a whole, only 51.8% of the appropriations available for the year 2000 were committed, and that is without taking into account the situation of the new Community initiatives, which is truly unbelievable. Despite the fact that the Community initiatives were scaled down and simplified with the intention of making them more effective and were thus reduced to four – Leader, Interreg, Equal and Urban – the rate of budgetary implementation was zero for both commitments and payments, and no measures were approved. Furthermore, the guidelines for the innovative measures were not adopted until the beginning of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, these data induce us to raise the purely rhetorical question of whether the new programming rules really make it possible to ensure transparency of budget management and avoid liquidity bottlenecks. We cannot conceal our fear that the delays that affected the implementation of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund resources in 2000 might jeopardise the attainment of the goals charted for the crucial 2002-2006 programming period, and that is without even considering the measures from the previous periods. We were surprised to learn that, at the end of 2000, 11 years after the closure of commitments and nine years after the final date for making payments, as many as 35 programmes from before 1989 were still open. Moreover, there were as many as 73 operating programmes from the 1989-1993 period still open too. What can we say? We note that the non-extendable deadlines and the threats of stringent coercive measures repeatedly proposed by the Commission were once again disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to monitoring and evaluation: in its annual report for 2000 and its Special Report for 2001, the Court of Auditors has detected serious shortcomings in the management and control systems of the Commission and Member States. The seriousness of the errors in intermediate payment declarations is the same as in previous years and the most frequent errors are similar to those previously recorded in various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we agree with the opinion of the Court of Auditors that checks should meet internationally accepted standards, including provisions stipulating that those carrying out the checks should be independent of those implementing the project, which is not the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with ISPA, which would appear to be the reason my report has been slipped into the enlargement melting pot. We note that the Commission committed approximately one third of the funds earmarked for 2000 during the first year of programming and we wish to see implementation stepped up considerably so as to guarantee full use of these resources, which are vital to the balanced development of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am absolutely astounded that, in a debate on enlargement which includes a discussion on Hungary, not one Member has mentioned that, on 7 September 2001, Hungary appeared on the updated list of countries and territories which were not cooperating with the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, a group which is part of the OECD, which is a body to which the European Union itself belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fine, we did not realise what was going on in Hungary and we will continue to pretend that everything is going well and that our dream Europe will be better than the one we have today on which I have reported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wholeheartedly supports the Commission's line in the agriculture negotiations with the accession candidates. We call upon the Council and especially some Member States to give their support to the course adopted by the Commission on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of you are aware, I have been a fervent supporter of reform in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for many years. I will carry on being one in future, and we are looking forward to the Commission's communication on this issue with great excitement. However, one thing must be clear: the reform debate must not interfere with the negotiations. No premature conditions must be set at this stage which might delay the accession negotiations. Conversely, of course, the accession negotiations and the accession candidate countries' demands which understandably arise must not be allowed to impede the reform debate. The two must run in parallel, but must not block each other. We feel that this is a very important point. Naturally, there is conflict: some Member States are not in favour of any direct payments, while the recipient countries would like to receive 100% – and let me say to the candidate countries that they will yet again have cause to be grateful to the Commission for its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Sapard: while we spend our time arguing in the accession negotiations about the level of payments, we are failing to exploit the opportunities for pre-accession assistance that Sapard offers. We are pushing substantial amounts of money around as if we were a snow plough. Of course, there are reasons for this. I am not trying to apportion blame, but it is important to analyse the causes clearly and decide what else we can do. Of course, the decentralised management of the programme which we have opted for is a very demanding method of management. I am sure that money would have been paid out to projects much more quickly if we had had a centralised administration with management by the Commission. For sound and well-intentioned reasons, things were done differently. However, we must accept that we should have foreseen that these generous arrangements involving a decentralised structure and increased individual responsibility on the part of the accession countries were unlikely to achieve the rapid outcomes which were desired.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that there will be a major step forward this year. Unfortunately, however, we cannot make up for lost time. This is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recommended to the Commission last year that since we have opted to manage the programme in this way so that it involves a learning process which will ultimately be of benefit to the candidate countries after accession, why not implement other elements of rural development which we have tried and tested in a European Union with fifteen Member States? Why not include a Leader-type programme, which we have christened INPARD? Now, of course, this proposal by the committee is being dismissed by the Commission, which tells us that we have run out of time and that we do not have the right legal framework. The Commission often uses these arguments when it does not want to adopt a particular measure!</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be the case that if we now motivate the organisations and local populations by offering them a Leader-type programme and encourage them to develop their own ideas creatively in rural areas, things will not really get off the ground until they are full members. Nonetheless, we would win some time if we try to involve them pro-actively in this way. What is more, this type of programme might give us an opportunity to channel all the money that has been lost – not down the Swannee, I would not say that – back into the Finance Ministers' coffers.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not happy with the situation, none of us, we know that. The Commission is not happy either since the Sapard funds have not been used in the way we wanted. Nonetheless, let us at least put on a spurt over the final metres so that we can see something for our efforts, and so that all the Member States – and there are differences between the accession countries in this Sapard programme – so that they experience the EU and so that the money which is urgently needed for reforesting around agriculture, and for slaughter-houses and dairies etc. can genuinely help them to attain the quality needed to make their products marketable in Europe. We must also make it clear to the accession countries that it is not only a matter of quality: once they have full membership, they must supply the EU market. We cannot make distinctions in terms of the quality of agricultural products depending on whether they are destined for the EU's internal market or for export. The excuse used by some candidate countries – that we should not get excited about it because they are not exporting to the EU at present, and are actually buying products in Ukraine and Russia – will no longer be relevant. We cannot accept it. This is why money and prompt assistance are needed. Money now being spent on Sapard and other programmes in the accession countries will save us money later when these countries are full members. Let us try and make the best of it!</p>

To unify Europe and finally incorporate the countries of central Eastern Europe into the European Union is the historic challenge of our time.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, I see this as unreal because, for a very long time, I had got used to there being a dividing line running right through Europe, which would remain in place. Fortunately, it did not do so. Now, however, I feel that unification is taking an unduly long time, with many years already having passed since the dividing line disappeared. As Mr Brok said, there is no longer any excuse for delaying enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">To provide their people with safe and nutritious food has always been an important ambition for all states. That is why agricultural and food policies play such a large role, both in areas of the world with surpluses and in those with shortages.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural policy is a knotty problem in the accession negotiations. The EU cannot reasonably meet all the wishes of the candidate countries. In the negotiations, we must, however, create a feeling of understanding and community within the framework of the EU’s long-term economic and political commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council (General Affairs) was unable to achieve agreement on the issue of direct payments. I wish to take this opportunity to state clearly that I do not support the Swedish Government’s view, but am in favour of the Commission’s policy when it comes to the phasing-in of direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">One Paragraph of our report proposes that the Commission should provide help and support on the issue of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s continued work with a view to accession. I would therefore thank the Commissioner for having already begun by explaining that this should be done. It is very pleasing when we are agreed in our endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also addressing a number of points which may perhaps make the negotiations a little smoother. It is possible that the Commission has already come up with these ideas. Regarding the establishment of quotas and volumes, we believe that, within the framework of the quotas and volumes proposed by the Commission, account should be taken of the candidate countries’ situation during the reference period, their production potential and their consumption trends.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that those countries which, for various reasons, have exposed their agriculture to a tough market in recent years should not be treated unfairly. In countries with low direct payments prior to accession, it should moreover be possible to provide the option of exceeding that level. I do not say that that should apply generally, because it is sensible not to allow any increase over and above previous levels. There should nonetheless be an opportunity and scope for discussion about the option of exceeding that level in those cases in which the economy permits this and in which competitiveness will not be harmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the candidate countries are undergoing major readjustments, it would also be appropriate after a little while to review how the common agricultural policy is to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council is right in saying that enlargement is one thing and agricultural policy another. There are, however, connections, and we believe it is a matter of urgency for both EU and candidate countries directly to begin to discuss how a future agricultural policy might look. We are all aware that it must be changed, and such discussions would perhaps facilitate acceptance by the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the EU, in accordance with the discussions now being conducted at the World Food Conference and in accordance with the WTO’s ambitions, has a crucial interest in being able to sell its food on a functioning world market. Hopefully, it will then be possible to exploit its production potential.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a recommendation to the Council and the Commission: negotiate with knowledge, sensitivity and love, and we shall achieve a good result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, on 18 April 2002 the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities adopted an opinion drafted by Mrs Dybkjær on the basis of the Commission reports submitted in November 2001. Unfortunately, Mr Brok's otherwise very important report does not include any of our proposals on the legal and social position of women in the candidate countries and, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights, I should like to express my committee's acute displeasure to the House. Naturally I hope that the amendments tabled by my committee on the subject will be adopted tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion, our committee stressed that adopting the acquis communautaire on equal opportunities for men and women is a sine qua non to accession because this is a basic human rights issue. Institution building and strengthening institutional and administrative capacities in this area are basic prerequisites to full application of the European acquis. Equality of the sexes is a fundamental and integral part of economic, social and democratic development, which is why it must act as a guideline in the development and accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the candidate countries must ensure that the acquis<span class="italic"> </span>on equal opportunities for men and women is applied fully and effectively before they accede. As you know, the acquis communautaire on equal opportunities consists of nine directives on equal pay, equal treatment in the workplace, health and safety, work for pregnant women, parental leave, the burden of proof in cases of discrimination and equal treatment under social policy. We also feel it is very important for the candidate countries to develop or reform their judicial and administrative structures, in order to create the right conditions for applying the acquis communautaire efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights has of course taken account of progress already made by the candidate countries and has identified areas in which further improvement is needed. It is important, in our view, for the enlargement procedure to include the application of efficient measures to prevent and combat trafficking in women, prostitution, sexual abuse of children and child pornography in the candidate countries, given that many of these countries are still the countries of origin, transit and destination for international organised crime networks in the modern slave trade. In addition, problems persist in certain candidate countries as far as children are concerned, as a direct consequence of weaknesses in social protection systems. The Commission is called on to step up its efforts to wipe out all forms of violence against women as part of the accession strategy, in order to ensure that women's personal rights and dignity are safeguarded and, of course, to act as an incentive for improving children's rights and child protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We still need a broad programme of institutional intervention and economic support in order to incorporate the gender equality dimension in the economic guidelines for the accession process and counterbalance the negative impact on gender equality of privatisation and cuts in public spending. As you know, the transition to a market economy is exerting huge pressure on all aspects of employment in many of the candidate countries. We are particularly concerned about the adverse impact which this transition has on women, given that they are always the first to suffer from cuts in the budget in the areas of child care, education and the social protection systems which allow them to combine working and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to promote suitable public and private investment in social sectors in the candidate countries, in order to make it easier for more women to enter representative institutions and the centres of power. There is a serious democratic deficit in this sector in all the candidate countries. This being so, we call on the Commission to tell us what has been achieved in the candidate countries as regards adopting the social acquis communautaire on equal opportunities. We should also like to know what progress the candidate countries have made in constructing the relevant framework over this period.</p>

While we know that there is little public support for enlargement, there is hardly a critical noise to be heard in this House. This confirms the impression that this is the umpteenth European project that is being forced through by a European elite instead of holding an honest, open dialogue with genuinely concerned people. Honourable ladies and gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, these people are not only rightwing-populist and anti-European types, they are also ordinary citizens with real concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to give this honest dialogue a shot in the arm, the Liberal Group is asking why the EU is granting asylum to people from countries with whom we are round the negotiating table? Either those countries are safe, in which case we should not accept any asylum seekers, or they are not safe, and they need to be taken to task over this in the framework of the political criteria. The Liberal Group is taking the asylum obligations arising from the Geneva Convention very seriously. We want a humane and just policy. How can we achieve this following enlargement?

Many realise this. Others prefer to speculate about uncertainty, fear and alleged dissatisfaction. More than ever, it is the politicians’ responsibility not to pander to that populism. It is our task, and that of the media, to offer the people a true picture of reality, whether this is beneficial or not. Parliament and the Commission largely agree on the policy to be adopted. I would thank Commissioner Verheugen for his very committed speech. He has always approached this matter with due thoroughness, with a critical eye and with a great sense of responsibility for the European Union and for the candidate countries. This is how we as Parliament would have wanted it, and this is how it has been all these years. The evaluation of progress and of shortcomings in the candidate countries has always been clear and detailed. In the interest of the enlargement process, we have always said to our friends in the candidate countries that we want to see what their suffering is rooted in. We can use this knowledge in order to aim our policy effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to point out that a great deal is yet to be done in the area of public freedoms. This is only natural, on account of the rule of law being prioritised with good reason. A great deal of money has been, and still is being, pumped into improving the capacity of governments to enforce and apply their adapted legislation. In the recent Commission communication on administrative and judicial capacity, it is noted that a great deal of work still needs to be done. I would like to ask the Commissioner what the odds are of a timely completion of a necessary improvement and further development of the rule of law in the candidate countries, so that these can function effectively after 18 months to two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner, particularly the Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, has an important role to play in the field of monitoring and guaranteeing the smooth running of things, also in future. In this area, a yellow card will probably be issued more frequently in future than we were used to in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the idea of perpetuating back-door politics by appointing a high official for this policy in the Council is highly astonishing. I experience this as a slap in the face of the Commission and Parliament. What kind of example is this supposed to set for the candidate countries? Apparently, it is one of the Council’s fondest wishes to avoid parliamentary control, certainly in the form of the capacity to remove a political official from office.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the idea of a referendum is frequently being mooted in a few countries. A referendum would possibly have been appropriate at the outset of the whole process, but then the surveys were so positive that nobody was ever in any doubt about the fact that the European citizen really wanted this enlargement, by way of paying off a debt of honour to Central Europe. A survey <span class="italic">now</span> would be very odd indeed, because that would give the impression that after this enormous amount of work – which, very often, was also very unpopular work – after compliance with all the requirements, it would be possible yet again to be faced with a ‘no’ from the Member States, based on a referendum which would be very difficult to interpret. This is why I think that we as politicians must find our way to the people, as we have always done, with the sense of criticism that we have always had. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, we can claim that the internal market already exists. However, we are still concerned about the shortcomings in the administrative and judicial systems in the future Member States. I would like to tell you something which I found out at the weekend in Prague, namely that the process of registering a foreign commercial company in the Czech trade register takes about a year – unless you are prepared to pay EUR 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In the internal market, no gap should open up between rights and duties as a result of the failure to enforce environmental, social and consumer standards. We need fair competition, also in the enlarged internal market. I should like to thank Mrs Sommer for her report. It provides a strong impetus towards fruitful cooperation and cohesion at the interface between East and West in the border regions. Giving priority to SMEs is something we strongly support, and we hope that this will be implemented in forthcoming calls for proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was difficult enough in itself. Providing a comprehensive overview of the report in just one minute now is impossible. I therefore draw attention to the short justification provided in my report. Anyone interested should have a look at it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention one issue which is very close to my heart, and wish to underline rather more pointedly than my colleague Willy Görlach that as I come from a region which has been part of the European Union since 1990 and has experienced a great deal of solidarity in the last twelve years, I have a very clear appreciation of the efforts made by the candidate countries, especially the Central and Eastern European countries, to become eligible for accession. What I would now ask of us all – from the European Union, especially the Council and particularly from two countries which have always been the driving force in this European Union, namely Germany and France – is to remove, as soon as possible, the obstacles which stand in the way of union with these countries and enable us, myself included, to conduct a European election campaign on both sides of the Oder and Neisse in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first point is the high level of unemployment in a number of the candidate countries. In Poland, for example, the employment figure is 19% and is not showing any signs of abating. This requires support for the most heavily affected areas and an effort by private investors, who should, at the same time, invest in training and in-service training. I would ask the Commission to throw its weight behind this plea too.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is the fear among our own citizens of losing their jobs or of large flows of immigrants from the candidate countries. This should be removed. There are plenty of arguments. The candidate countries are enjoying strong economic growth and will be able to accommodate their own citizens. The average monthly income in the enlargement countries is rising sharply, and exports from our countries to them is rising more steeply than the import from those countries. Belgium, for example, enjoys an annual increase of 15%. Moreover, all the figures bear out that immigration to the European Union is restricted. Commissioner, you have done sterling work at the summit of entrepreneurs, and many statistics have made their way to the press. This is vital, because we must dispel people's anxiety. I would urge you to continue in the same vein for all these social issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, if all goes to plan, we can land a very big fish at the end of the year, which makes a change. In fact, the fisheries sector is ahead of agriculture in the enlargement process, which also makes a change. The fisheries chapter has already been closed with all candidates, albeit with some restrictions in the case of Poland and Malta. Nonetheless, here too, some positive developments are emerging now that Poland has withdrawn its demand for special rights of access, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of enlargement, the coastline will increase significantly in length and the number of actors in the fisheries sector will increase. On a day-to-day basis, we do not anticipate any major problems, but there may be some difficulties which we will have to take on board. In particular, there is a lack of more effective administrative structures, a standard register, effective controls, genuinely harmonised hygiene and environmental standards, and measures to tackle flags of convenience. However, we should be able to deal with these. I am confident, therefore, that we can resolve these problems and set a course towards an enlarged European fishing industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder whether in their summing-up replies both Minister de Miguel and Commissioner Verheugen might refer to progress, as far as public opinion is concerned, and any further initiatives they have in mind. We all pay lip service to this – bearing in mind the referenda – but much greater practical application is required, in particular from the Member States, not simply from the institutions of the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three thoughts concerning action in the Member States. Firstly, further public platforms should be given to leaders from the candidate countries, not only political but also cultural leaders – writers, film-makers, and musicians. Secondly, the links between the institutions of civil society should be publicised. Thirdly, something should be done to overcome the collective amnesia which was imposed by the Soviet tyranny on western Europe, allowing us to forget the thousand years of cultural, political and commercial links which we are now in the process of restoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every single time the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has spoken with the Commissioner, he has not hesitated to state that the ‘acquis communitaire’, if I may use that term, should also apply in that area. The Commissioner cannot be reproached for the fact that the ‘acquis’ was only introduced at the last moment in a long list of countries. It means, however, that I should like to call upon the Commissioner and his colleagues to continue to monitor this area so that we do not only consistently obtain the necessary facts but also ensure that the countries supply these.</p>
<p class="contents">To the President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to say that, in my opinion, the Member States have a special obligation towards women, for it is one thing for us to get the governments to accept membership and something else to get the people to do so. Women form more than half of the population, and what women in the candidate countries have so far had cause to note is high unemployment affecting women in particular. It is very important that attention be given specifically to the area of women's rights when we come to the next phase: that of convincing people that enlargement is in actual fact a good idea. I believe that the Member States have a contribution to make to this area and that they and the Commission together have a special contribution to make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement is the most exciting, difficult political challenge of this century and cannot just be addressed from an accounting perspective.</p>

The quality of the European Union’s politics must be enhanced too, and the Union must become more than just a large market.

The needs of the candidate countries have been taken into account, especially as their take-up capacity will be limited during the first years following accession. Similarly, no call is being made on the present Member States to increase their contributions. Certain Member States maintain that this proposal is overly generous in the initial stages of negotiation and have countered by proposing that the amounts for which provision was made in Berlin for 2002 should be used for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">This criticism is unfounded because, first, a more restrictive proposal would be rejected outright by the candidate countries. The danger here is that negotiations will be derailed and we shall fail to find any common ground by the end of the year.

We therefore feel that the proposal, already called for by Parliament, to phase in the Structural Funds and to introduce the Cohesion Fund in the new countries at a level of at least a third of the total allocation for structural measures is highly appropriate, for it will be a considerable contribution towards improving the absorption capacity of these countries which are, still today, effectively without genuine administrative capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already, on other occasions, requested increasingly careful monitoring of the committed resources on the part of the Commission, and this is becoming still more urgent and pressing if we consider that prolonging access to the Cohesion Fund in this way to improve implementation of structural measures in the candidate countries must be seen as a completely new strategy and that it therefore cannot be understood to be a permanent facility. We therefore support Mr Böge’s proposal to monitor the trend of improvements in Structural Funds implementation carefully, proceeding, where implementation is improving, to reduce the Cohesion Fund quota gradually. We hope that the problems encountered in the implementation of the ISPA, Sapard and Phare instruments, for example, despite the fact that the Funds were trebled as of 2000, can be overcome or, at any rate, diminished as the institutions are strengthened too.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that, while, on the whole, we welcome the Commission’s action, we share Mr Böge’s concerns and confusion regarding the financial perspective, which does not necessarily have to cover the 2007-2013 period if we take up the option of prolonging by a short period the current interinstitutional agreement and financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the EU and the Member States themselves encourage and support the border regions, which are suffering massive problems, and that help must include preventing low-wage dumping and unfair competition, then a sense of cross-border neighbourliness will grow and that will be to everyone’s advantage.

Clearly support under the Sapard scheme is of vital importance in assisting that process. However, the take-up of this and other schemes is patchy. Expectations in those countries are universally high. There is a continuing problem that these expectations may not be met, producing the inevitable political and social fall-out.</p>

I would like to mention just two key figures: one is the 15% of agricultural production in the candidate countries, and the other is the 50% of cultivated agricultural area that can be further capitalised. So it would be wrong to continue trying to improve production structures. It would be better to create alternative sources of employment in rural areas, either crafts or small-scale industries.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, it is important that any possible expansion of production should not add to the already high levels of overproduction in our agriculture but that we should in that event find the right ways of developing craft trade and small-scale industry structures in the candidate countries’ agriculture and rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must not therefore be used by the Council as a bargaining chip to obtain strategic positions which have nothing to do with the actual political process of enlarging Europe. It must not be a bargaining chip to obtain certain modifications of the agricultural policy or to resolve other problems, and I therefore congratulate the Spanish Presidency on having done such good work and I directly condemn those governments, with Socialist majorities, which are exploiting the enlargement procedure, which this Parliament and European society are very attached to, to obtain agreements on other issues which they have few reasons for, by trying to strengthen their case by making their position conditional.</p>

The internal cohesion between the richest and poorest regions and countries must be maintained, regardless of the fact that ten countries about to enter are clearly poorer.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that more of the Community budget should be spent and it should be better spent, in that order, and we must continue to try to ensure that executing the Community budget is not an obstacle course.

The European House can and will be extended eastwards. At the same time, a further southwards expansion will enrich the European Union with two beautiful and culturally valuable island states, Malta and Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not surprise you, however, if I now discuss one of these two states, namely Cyprus. Cyprus is the candidate country that has made the most progress in adapting to the acquis communautaire. That has already been pointed out. We can therefore safely assume that Cyprus will be included in the first round of accessions and that the next European elections will also take place in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: will all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike, be able to take part in those elections? In other words, will the division of the island, which is contrary to international law, be overcome prior to accession? We want it to be. We hope it will be. It really is time that Europe’s last divided capital at last became a living capital again and that Cypriots of both ethnic groups could live together in Cyprus in peace. I very much hope, as the President-in-Office of the Council has also made clear, that a political solution will be found by October at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that direct negotiations are now taking place for the first time in many years shows that the accession process is having the catalytic effect we hoped for. I also hope that Turkey, which is also a candidate country, understands that a solution for Cyprus is very much in Turkey’s interest and that Denktash cannot insist on a two state model.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in Europe’s as well as Cyprus’ interest that the solution should result in a state that is capable of acting and taking decisions at international and European level. Cyprus must speak with one voice. If such a solution is not achieved by October, then we must try to ensure that Cyprus’ accession or membership acts as a catalyst for a solution, because the overwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots want to belong to the European Union and they also want to be able to live in a free Cyprus after accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have all dreamed about and fought for over so many years – a unified Europe – is on the verge of being achieved, and there is nothing odd about the fact that the questions are accumulating.</p>
<p class="contents">In the candidate countries where referendums are to be held, a lot of people are probably wondering what they are getting themselves into. Many questions are being raised within the EU about costs and about how the EU is going to be able to function. Extremist parties are exploiting enlargement in their policies and playing upon people’s fear of the unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">Political leadership is therefore required more than ever. The leaders of the candidate countries must resolutely continue with the required reforms before the negotiations can be concluded. They have done an impressive job, and a number of questions still remain. It is a question of never giving up and of being honest. A number of domestic problems will still remain following membership, for there is a life after the accession date too.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us within the EU also have a big responsibility: to tell people about the huge importance of enlargement and about what is at stake. Who believed that enlargement would be cost-free? Clearly, enlargement has its price, but in the long term we are all winners. We must also prepare a reserve plan to cover the contingency of there being a ‘no’ vote in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the European Parliament has accepted its responsibility. We have stubbornly pushed ahead with the enlargement process, set a definite date for this and carefully reviewed progress. In the report we are now adopting, it is crystal-clear that we support enlargement, at the same time as highlighting a number of problems. We too have a responsibility to convince people of this historic task.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an historic opportunity to unite the whole continent. Together, we can solve common problems relating to environmental damage, crime, growth, security and the safeguarding of democracy and human values.</p>
<p class="contents">A short time remains, and I am convinced that the Copenhagen Summit in December will be an historic occasion and lead to the EU’s biggest and most important enlargement so far. Enlargement is irrevocable and absolutely necessary. The alternative is chaos, uncertainty and a fatal division of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not so much because we would like to have a bigger market, but because the European Union appears to be capable of guaranteeing peace and stability, albeit within its own borders, but not outside of those, unfortunately. It could serve as a model for conflict prevention, in other words, and we would like to see this model enlarged. Mr Brok and the co-rapporteurs, whom we would like to congratulate, have demonstrated in this report the enormous progress that has been made, but unfortunately, many candidate countries are still facing shortcomings in terms of administrative capacity and independent jurisdiction, but also in terms of independent police and independent media. Mafia and corruption still remain a curse. Many countries have regional differences in fighting these, for which no instruments are actually available.</p>
<p class="contents">We would draw your attention particularly to human rights and minorities. One of these minorities who live in abject misery are, of course, the Roma in various candidate countries. They often live in appalling conditions with poor housing, a high level of unemployment and low educational standards. Although plans are in preparation in most countries, the effective involvement of this minority often remains a problem. The positive regard for the Roma culture could be a key to the emancipation and integration of that community. Accountability of the Roma and their participation in the implementation of the projects which are set up by the European Union itself should be the norm. Furthermore, the Roma are, of course, a European nation without a state, and they are, as such, our joint responsibility. But other minorities too often experience a lack of appreciation and recognition of their identities. Their fate is often heavily marked by history. There are scars and wounds that have not healed. One of the consequences is the criticism of some of the effects which the Beneš decrees have had, to which also Commissioner Verheugen referred. Accession to the Union can offer minorities hope for the future in which borders become less important and peoples can join forces across the borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a whole host of small countries will be joining after the accession, and this will place the need for a new view of peoples without a state and regional participation in a new light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the complex documentation accompanying accession negotiations, the chapters on agriculture, finance and regional policy in particular have attracted a lot of public interest. People – by which I mean explicitly the citizens of the EU – are paying more attention to these things than ever before. At this point I would like to ask the Commission to give the <span class="italic">Info-Points Europe,</span> where they exist, more money so they can perform their current tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal to phase in direct aids to farmers by 2013 cannot be the last word. This model is not convincing because it lacks sufficient justification. The European reference yield, only 2.96 in Poland’s case for example, used as the basis for payment of direct aid is more than just an ugly detail. That is not the way to encourage viability and sustainability of agriculture in the candidate countries. My group believes that European agricultural policy cannot operate two policies in the long term. My group also wants to see the candidate countries’ integration into the common agricultural policy organised in tune with those countries’ specific macroeconomic trends with special attention paid to social needs.</p>
<p class="contents">EU enlargement can be achieved only by the EU, the Member States and their regions working together. Development of the border regions is particularly important here. All involved must intensify their efforts, but they need the close attention of the European Union and the nation states. The current programme of economic development for the border regions, amounting to EUR 245 million, is not enough. Its availability is tied to other flows into and out of the regions, placing an even greater burden on already weak local authorities. But the EU budget is not under such pressure. If the Council Presidency under Spanish Chairmanship is unable to agree a final figure for direct agricultural aids – because of impending elections as, alas, in Germany – then the last few months will be spent trying to catch up, and in my opinion there will only be losers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like put on the record of this House that the Treaty of Nice needs to be adopted by all existing Member States of the European Union to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union by ten countries, which we hope to see in the not too distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hate anyone to misunderstand or misinterpret the decision of the Irish electorate not to approve the Treaty of Nice, because the Irish population in general, even those who oppose the adoption of the Treaty of Nice, is in favour of enlargement. This House, as an institution, and the Irish people, need to guarantee that we can deliver on ratification of the Treaty of Nice in the short term. The Irish Government will therefore be proposing a declaration in Seville on traditional Irish military neutrality, which I hope will be approved by other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that, in our negotiations with the accession countries, we should not stand in the way of their progress towards the adoption of the acquis communautaire. We should not set up unfair barriers to their accession. When these countries join the European Union they will bring a new impetus, a new ideology, and a new belief in the vision the founding fathers of the European Union had of a Europe of peace, prosperity, progress and respect for Europe's diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret to say that this is far from being the case at the moment, particularly in the agriculture sector. We want to integrate countries in which agriculture and exports are very important into the European Union, even though they have not to date adopted the Community acquis. The Sapard programme has effectively failed and its future prospects are slim as certain countries will be unable to fulfil their cofinancing responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the farmers are worried. Some of them, from both Member States and candidate countries, came to tell us this yesterday, and we must listen to them. The candidate countries are afraid that the process of modernising agriculture might destabilise the rural economy. They are opposed to the Commission proposals with regard to both direct payments and setting quotas. Farmers in the Member States cannot agree to seeing their products rivalled by products that do not comply with the same health or environmental requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In asking for transition periods, the candidate countries have acknowledged their difficulties, yet what will happen if the objectives of protecting biodiversity and fauna are added to the agricultural constraints prior to accession? In this context, it is difficult to assess the success of enlargement. Exceeding the financial perspectives will not solve this. I ask you, what purpose would be served by favouring a timetable? Therefore, let us be sensible and take the time to create the conditions necessary for successful accession. By acting hastily, as is being proposed, we could ruin agriculture in both the Member States and the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in Mr Olsson’s report, I cannot support item 24, as I reject the idea of turning our farmers into gardeners and riding instructors, as it stipulates. Our smaller farms participate fully in and are essential to production diversity, supply and rural development. I think it is important, however, to emphasise item 20, which reminds the Commission of the need to develop other activities in rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is coming, that is a fact, and it is good that it is. But it will not be a tragedy if we fail to stick precisely to 2004 as the accession date. It is the quality of the process that is crucial, not the tempo. The project’s success must be assured. The report has many merits. But I wish it had shown more political courage and been open about the problems we face. I will mention two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there are no definite plans in place for financing enlargement beyond 2006. I think the practical constraints method is a dubious strategy. The public needs to know what to expect. They have a right to know. This is not an intellectually specious argument, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at the heart of it, the dispute about the Beneš decrees is about the 1946 amnesty law. We cannot allow history to be misused as an obstacle to enlargement. But the amnesty law legitimises expulsion as an instrument of conflict resolution and expressly exempts crimes from punishment. That is contrary to the ethical foundations of the EU, the principles of the European community of values and the Copenhagen criteria. The Balkan conflict was about precisely the same thing: ethical and ethnic cleansing. Anyone who plays down this conflict of values does Europe a disservice. Right and wrong are indivisible and non-negotiable, whether in the past, in the present or in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At least, that is what I find when meeting citizens at events in my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I would like to speak in particular about the challenge of agriculture and eastward enlargement. I would like to congratulate Mr Olsson on his very good report on EU enlargement and agriculture. How can the new Member States be successfully integrated into the common agricultural policy? That is a key question for most of the candidate countries and it is crucial because in the countries of central and eastern Europe agriculture accounts for a larger proportion of national income than the EU average. The same is true of employment in the economy as a whole. The accession of ten countries in 2004 will increase the agricultural area by 29% and the number of agricultural holdings by 74%. But the number of consumers will increase by 24%.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we best shape accession and integration in the long term? In my opinion, the countries of central and eastern Europe will and must press ahead with changing the structure of their agriculture. The European agricultural model where farmers have the twin tasks of producing in some places and caring for the countryside in others must be applied in those countries too. In my view, the high standards of hygiene in production and processing must apply from the first day of accession, otherwise European consumer policy will become a farce. Environmental concerns and alternative jobs in rural areas must be funded from the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. We agree that the Commission is taking the right approach there in aligning financial compensation payments gradually. If we allowed too much money in at the start, agricultural structures there would be ossified, and that cannot be the right way for those concerned either.</p>
<p class="contents">While I believe our citizens do not know enough about eastern Europe, I also noted during the hearing that farmers in the candidate countries, too, still have a lot of public relations work to do at home.</p>

Credit should be given to his efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to echo his opening words in relation to Lithuania. The decision taken by the Lithuanian Government in relation to the closure of the Ignalina power station is an extremely brave one, as it is not in accordance with general public opinion in Lithuania, and illustrates just how determined the Lithuanians are to fulfil the EU entry requirements. They have moved at tremendous speed in order to catch up, and it has been very difficult for them. However, if accession were suddenly to disappear off the horizon, that decision by the Lithuanian Government and Parliament could well rebound on them and we could find accession moving further away and not closer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to keep to the timetable and the road map. We must not allow that timetable to be eroded. If we slow down, some of the accession countries – for example, Hungary – will turn elsewhere, perhaps towards the United States rather than the European Union. Political movements that we see within the European Union could well mean that we will be unable to proceed if we miss the Copenhagen Summit deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly said: we must take advantage of this window of opportunity before it is closed. Or, as the late, great Elvis Presley said: "It's now or never, .... Tomorrow will be too late". History will not judge us extremely well if we fail to show the leadership and courage required at this moment. That is not to suggest that we should somehow weaken our position in relation to our demands on the countries. Each country must be judged on its own merit and keep to the criteria, in particular in relation to implementation and administrative capacity. Let us look at individual countries. The Czech Republic needs to reassure us that competition policy will be in line with EU competition policy and that public administration will be reformed. Latvia has to make serious advances in the reform of its judicial system and in dealing with corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Commissioner Verheugen's plans in relation to Bulgaria and Romania, but we must also send out a message to Romania that it has to get its act together, otherwise it will seriously fall behind schedule. The Brok report should be a warning to them in relation to corruption and reform of public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that we have to convince the people that enlargement is in their interests. We should stop talking about the problems of enlargement and remind people that enlargement is a solution to many of those problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement is a huge political and historical event but it is also the biggest objective regarding development cooperation the Member States have ever committed themselves to. For that reason its success requires mutual cooperation and trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposals on financing enlargement are realistic and even rather shrewd. The new Member States need support; the principle whereby they immediately become net beneficiaries is the correct one, as it takes into consideration their solvency rating. Likewise, there is no intention to reduce the income of farmers in the new Member States but put it on a growth track. It is just as clear, however, that the financial burden of the present Member States cannot be suddenly increased. For that reason, phased-in implementation is the right way to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to draw attention to one matter. The new Member States are attractive agricultural countries in terms of their natural conditions. The price of land is low in these countries. Rates of pay are 10 – 20% of the EU average, and the EU is furthermore intending to support up to 80% of investments in association with the Member State in question. For that reason my question relates to family farming. Does the EU intend to support industrial agriculture in the same way as family farming or is the intention to implement aid and modulations in one form or another that decrease with size? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of fear, the fear of enlargement which is trapping an increasing number of politicians in its power. Fear that enlargement will be too fast after all, or that it will be too costly after all, or both. Politicians across the political divide are starting to become anxious. Old and new arguments are being tabled, often under the guise that we now finally want to listen to the voice of the people, thus reinforcing the impression that many politicians do not know exactly what they have been doing up to now and are now starting to tense up right before the final exam. They tense up because they are starting to realise that they have done too little to convince their electorate that enlargement is very much a positive step, both for the inhabitants of the Member States and those of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this chorus of sceptics, a number of voices are becoming ever louder. One objection, for example, is that agricultural reform should be complete before we can enlarge. Let there be no mistake about this: reform is desperately needed. The common agricultural policy must be reformed. The European Parliament should continue to demand this, without any concessions. However, without enlargement, the reform of agricultural policy will not take place. To prescribe this reform now as a condition for approval of enlargement is tantamount to creating not a win-win situation, but a lose-lose situation. Who would benefit from this, except for those opposed to reforms and to enlargement?</p>
<p class="contents">Another argument which is heard increasingly frequently is that the EU itself should undergo internal reform first. This too is desperately needed, but please let us not resort to blackmail. It is unacceptable for the candidate countries to be taken hostage because we have not completed all our tasks. Here too, delay of enlargement means delay of necessary reforms. After all, these have never come about without extreme pressure yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to quote another argument that is increasingly common these days, namely that human rights are being violated in the candidate countries. That too is true, let there be no misunderstanding about this. In those countries, the rights of the Roma and those of homosexuals, for example, leave a great deal to be desired. It is extremely important for this to be denounced. My group has been doing this for years; this is something altogether different from brushing problems under the carpet. But here too, it is true, and I am convinced of this, that these problems that are very much there can best be solved if those countries become EU Members and if they are not kept in isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not bureaucrats, we are politicians. This is not about ticking a list and automatically giving a fail if five minuses appear on that list. We are in favour of weighing up the situation. What has happened, what needs to happen and what is the most demanding part?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, we should all ensure that the completion of enlargement in the next few months does not lead to one large European coitus interruptus, because that would be wholly unsatisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, enlargement is in fact an historical venture, but for a new Europe, not so that certain factions can rewrite post-war history. Any attempts to do so must be rejected; they are odious, irrespective of whether they emanate from the candidate countries or from members of the Union. I detected a great deal of anxiety in Mr Verheugen's speech; I only hope it will prove to be unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we are negotiating with twelve countries. Does that mean Bulgaria and Romania have no further prospects of accession? Will their accession depend at some point on the veto of one of the present candidates? You said, Commissioner, that we have to give them some sort of clear signal, but what exactly? This lack of clarity pains me, as does the fact that nothing has been said about the accession prospects of the rest of the Balkans in the more distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns Cyprus. The Commissioner has asked for Turkey to exert its influence so that some sort of solution can be found. Who is it supposed to exert this influence on? What a pity Mr de Miguel did not meet the commander of the Turkish forces when he visited the occupied part of Cyprus. He might have been able to tell us more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, the academic debate should be well and truly over. We must now proceed in a planned way with their integration. I compliment the candidate countries on their efforts to conform to the stringent requirements for entry. For some of them it has been, and continues to be, difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">From an agricultural perspective, Mr Olsson has addressed the challenge of enlargement in a reasoned and practical way. For me, integration depends on our success in fusing the agricultural economies of candidate countries with existing Member States in a manner that causes least disruption to both and in time provides for their full participation in the common agricultural policy. Anything short of that would undermine the principles of CAP that, by and large, have served European farmers and consumers well.</p>
<p class="contents">As we face a mid-term review of the Berlin agreement and the inevitable long term CAP reform, we must not allow the review to deviate from what was agreed in Berlin or to contemplate a move towards re-nationalisation of CAP in future reform. Farming in Europe as evidenced by yesterday's 15,000 farmer demonstration continues to be difficult. With the benefit of hindsight we have not in the context of world trade provided the degree of protection necessary for our farmers from the obvious unfair competition and market manipulation by our competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">With the completion of enlargement, Europe has the potential to be a dominant player in world trade. We will only succeed, however, if we are committed in the short term to supporting the European model based on family farming. I alert the House, not for the first time, to the serious threat to the survival of that model because of long-term uncertainty and the availability of alternative, attractive and more financially rewarding employment for young people who would in normal circumstances take up farming as a career. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the common fisheries policy is widely acknowledged as having been disastrous, so too is the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The central fault of the CAP is that it is a common policy, and it is not possible to have one policy covering sub-Arctic Finland, the temperate grasslands of Cheshire, the wine growers of Bordeaux, the arid near-subtropical vegetable growers of Catalonia, or the sheep producers of the mountains of Greece, much less the highly populous Denmark which produces more pigs than people.</p>
<p class="contents">But the other major fault of the CAP is that it is an agricultural policy. As demonstrated during the foot-and-mouth crisis in our country, agriculture is an integral part of the rural economy. There is massive interdependence between farming and its rural infrastructure. Support one part without taking into account the needs of the other and you can create damaging distortions, which is exactly what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement would have been an opportunity to have started with a clean sheet, but it was missed with Agenda 2000's so-called reforms; and it will be missed again. Now the disaster is to be imposed on the enlargement countries. This you will have cause to regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the Commission proposal that there should now be some phasing-in of direct payments, but it also believes that this must not be allowed to stand in the way of a restructuring of aids in the upcoming reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe it will, however, because the 35% given leave room for manoeuvre. The report speaks of reaching 100% by 2013, but it does not say what reaching 100% in 2013 means. If the last reform had had the 45% modulation in the upper range that was once mooted, we would now have a difference of 35% to 55%. That would not be so great. We are therefore looking to the Commission to make proposals towards reform in the near future, which, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, will make enlargement both possible and stable. We also believe the proposal to make direct payments to semi-subsistence farmers is a sensible one, but we suggest this be raised from EUR 750 to EUR 1 500. That would entitle 5-6 ha holdings to the full compensation payment. In Poland that would be approximately 50% of holdings. So it includes the phasing-in, the social component. We can see there is room for manoeuvre here.</p>
<p class="contents">Something we particularly welcome and call for is greater investment in the second pillar when money is reallocated. That is money that is needed first and foremost in the candidate countries. It is palpably obvious that rural areas there need development. Commissioner Fischler, I am referring here once again – as I think Mr Görlach has already done – to the 'bottom-up'<span class="italic"> </span>approach and to our Sapard programme in Leader form, where the Commission has so far stubbornly refused to underpin this with legislation. We say it is urgently necessary that civil forces in the candidate countries should also be involved in the work of these projects so that people will feel happier about the European Union and we can lean back rather more contentedly and calmly when they come to vote on it.</p>
<p class="contents">So I urge you once again, Commissioner Fischler, to get your bureaucracy moving. There are precedents. You only need to follow them. And we are always ready to help you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we also have a vision of this venture as a humane, democratic and just venture for all the nations and citizens involved. This being so, we think it is very important, nay vital that we examine the issue of gender equality in the candidate countries. We need to promise to make this issue an accession criterion, not put it on the back burner until after accession. Similarly, we need to promise to assist with the policies and funds needed to encourage and facilitate reform in the candidate countries in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities identifies the problems which women face today and the policies which need to be applied in order to wipe out discrimination in all sectors, so that more women are involved in shaping and making decisions on social, political and economic life. We should also point out that, where reforms are being introduced, suitable institutional and administrative mechanisms and the funds are lacking or the laws passed are not applied.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to voice these concerns and our commitment to promoting gender equality as an accession criterion in tomorrow's vote. This new European world which is being born also belongs to women and we must give them every opportunity to make a contribution to it and enjoy their fair share of the benefits of this joint endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the applicant countries were not to be included, Central and Eastern Europe could see unrest, dictatorships and large-scale uncontrolled migration start to emerge. Let us not forget how, for what appear to be insignificant reasons, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination can flare up in democratic elections in democratic countries, such as Austria, Holland and France. If we cannot effect controlled enlargement, with the approval of the people, there is a danger that we will see the Union rocked by extremist political eruptions. These may well be something even bigger than the current policy on immigration or questions of security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind everyone that we are admitting around 100 million people to the Union at one time. That is almost 30% of our present population. They will represent approximately 5% of the figure for GNP. Significantly poorer people will therefore be amongst us and also competing for jobs. To prevent the populist extreme right from rising any further it is vital for the new Member States to be admitted as members in a controlled way that benefits everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Some very well educated people from the new countries will also be joining us. We shall be greatly enriched culturally. That will be important in a time of content production and an information-based economy. We shall also have to deal with a negative tradition: there is no great respect for the law everywhere as, during the time of the Soviet Union, it was interpreted arbitrarily. By the end of the year the candidate countries should have produced a report on the corruption and crime that exist there. The implementation of EU legislation must likewise be properly verified.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a solution to the heated argument over Kaliningrad, I would propose that the Russians should go there by train. We have seen that before. The buses could also be watched. I would have asked Commissioner Verheugen about this but he has just gone to the swimming pool. Perhaps his advisor will take this question. Would that be all right? Many Russians are in favour of this idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This situation affects farming, in particular, because of the well-known weaknesses of a sector which is important for employment and the economy of various candidate countries. The situation has a considerable socio-economic impact on the candidate countries, entails additional costs and also requires a revision of the financial perspectives in order to ensure that it is not the most badly affected or least developed countries that foot the bill. This is why dividing Member States into first and second class when it comes to aid is unacceptable, as are quotas that fall well short of their capacities and needs. The consequences of this situation would be an increase in unemployment and poverty – something we cannot accept. Rural development and the protection of a high-quality farm production system require a revision of the CAP and not the renationalisation of its costs, which would harm not only the farmers of those countries but also the farmers of countries such as Portugal, whose system of farming is more vulnerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The difficulties do not come from the Spanish Presidency or from the Commission or from this Parliament. The Spanish Presidency has kept to the road map and is making every effort to unblock the unsettled matter of agriculture and to leave the timetable clear, in order to comply with the timescale proposed in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, the countries that put obstacles in the way of a consensus to adopt a common position will have to explain why enlargement should take place not according to the established timetable but at a speed dictated by their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">At these times, we must clear away doubts and help change a negative attitude, which is strongest in those countries which, right now, are blocking agreement in the chapter on agriculture and calling into question direct aids for agriculture, either through attempting to clear the financial horizon beyond 2006 or by questioning their inclusion in the Community acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal which Parliament supports, following the Commission’s line, and which is contained in the Böge report, is balanced, complies with the acquis and is compatible with the budget ceilings set in Berlin. It includes highly positive aspects, such as support for the phasing-in model for including the new Member States in direct aid payments, remembering that they form part of the acquis, and the phasing-in of the structural operations, but this must be compatible with an effective absorption capacity of the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, Madam President, the Eastern European countries were totalitarian dictatorships with planned economies. The changes that have taken place are so profound that we cannot allow ourselves to paralyse this march towards freedom just because some wish to ensure a reduction in their contribution to the Community coffers after 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the Commissioner that we should not get cold feet now, simply because we now have the difficult chapters to negotiate and each of the members and candidates are of course defending their own interests with vehemence and conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not lose sight of 2004, because the new Commission starts work in 2005 and the new commissioners from the new Member States would already have to be represented here by then. Whether there will be a ‘big bang’ – as we say – with the ten familiar countries, we do not know, but we should not cherish the hope, either, that we will be able to conduct several mini-rounds in the next few years. A bold step must be taken in 2004. At any rate, that remains our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it would be easier for us if we had already implemented many reforms. But I do not see that as a major problem, because the fact that we are faced with the great task of enlargement may perhaps even result in reform, especially of agricultural and regional policy, being carried through with greater vehemence. I do not see any contradiction here.</p>
<p class="contents">Have the candidate countries now satisfied all the criteria? As we see it, there is certainly still a lot to be done. In many countries transposition of the acquis communautaire is still far from adequate. Deciding things is one thing, putting them into practice is another. Many countries still have discriminatory rules regarding origin and gender, but that can be dealt with. Poor use is sometimes made of financial resources. But I also recall that even after accession my country, for example, did not take up and use all the financial resources it could have had from Brussels. We should not apply over strict criteria here. Something needs to be done about the promises concerning the environment, especially about the restructuring and closure of nuclear power plants, but some good progress has also been made.</p>
<p class="contents">With good will, all these problems can be overcome in the months ahead. And I want to expressly say that I do not regard history, which in many cases was one of conflict and not of commonality, as a reason to block enlargement. If, on the one hand, the nationalists there are can see that the expulsions after 1945 were a consequence of the terrible Nazi dictatorship, and if the others recognise that today, I stress today, the expulsion of minorities as happened by the consensus of the victorious powers after the Second World War, is no longer consistent with our present understanding of minority rights, then this question, too, does not stand in the way of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will not move forward without compromise. If, as sometimes happens, the EU Member States demand that the candidates fulfil all the criteria and that they reach the level of the Member States one hundred percent, or if they sometimes go even so far as to demand that they do better than the Member States, then of course enlargement will fail. It will also fail if the candidates demand to receive the full extent of all support measures right from the start. But we want success, success in 2004, no failure and no delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU will then have to yield to the terms imposed by Poland, the last country to resist acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the question of financing enlargement, many net beneficiaries might feel that they are the ones that are having to pay for it. The amount they receive in net benefits from the Union will fall. In fact the budget frameworks for the years 2007 – 2013 should be drawn up while the enlargement negotiations continue so that they are aware of the situation before the decisive decisions are taken. The Treaty of Nice makes that difficult, of course, as certain net beneficiaries saw their demands for unanimous decision-making accepted at Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with enlargement, the insistence that Ireland should hold a new referendum on the Treaty of Nice is putting unreasonable pressure on that country and clearly shows how undemocratic the EU is in its attitude to small Member States.

As regards Cyprus, which the previous speaker mentioned, I should like to say that the faster Turkey understands where Europe stands today, the more it will be able to help, not just in resolving the problems in Cyprus, but with its own European prospects. The universe is not conspiring against it; on the contrary, sometimes Turkey itself undermines its own European prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, one specific European Union policy which illustrates the solidarity of the richer with the poorer is obviously the policy of the Structural Funds, which apply to both present and future Member States. So, to turn to the report by Mr Turco, and may I offer my congratulations to Mr Turco, what I want to say is that, clearly, the current Member States were slow getting started in 2000 – it was mainly the Member States which were to blame, although I do not entirely absolve the European Commission – and Community initiatives are even slower getting started.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the pre-accession instrument, the ISPA, unfortunately this too has been slow getting started, although we must admit that it strikes a balance between measures on transport and measures on the environment. However, what we must bear in mind is that the ISPA is not just a funding instrument, it is a way of familiarising these countries with the European Union's way of thinking. So, as far as funding is concerned, whether we are talking about the Structural Funds or farming, we must demonstrate our support for those who are shortly to become members of the European Union by being generous up to a point; however, they too must do what they can, not just in taking up the funds but in making the best possible use of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, they have both done a splendid piece of work over a long period. I find it very encouraging that the timetable for the negotiations with the candidate countries looks as if it will be kept to, so that the negotiations concerning ten countries can be concluded by December under the Danish Presidency. The candidate countries have made a great effort to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria and implement the EU’s regulations. One crucial thing is now missing, namely a strengthening of the administrative capacity or management structure so that the legislation can also responsibly be put into effect. I would again praise the Commission for its action programme for developing administrative capacity. In my view, this has been a big help to many candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The ten candidate countries will probably be ready, but rather more doubts can be entertained about the EU’s own preparedness. I think this is cause for concern, not because of either the Commission’s or the Spanish Presidency’s handling of the matter but because we are in the grotesque situation in which the Fifteen have still not been able to reach agreement on a common position regarding the issue of direct aid to agriculture, and the divisions between the EU countries are particularly striking in this area. Until such time, furthermore, as there is a common position, we must stick to the Commission’s proposal in the area of agriculture, which I should like, moreover, to applaud. It is a sensible and very balanced proposal which can also ensure that the competitive situation for both Polish and other farmers is fair and just, without the EU’s funds drying up in the course of a few years. I think it is also right constantly to emphasise that enlargement and the forthcoming agricultural reform should be kept separate. In my opinion, it would be an historic mistake if the candidate countries were to be turned into hostages of the Member States’ own internal disagreements.</p>

The circle from Copenhagen to Copenhagen is about to be closed. If you come, as I do, from Copenhagen, the delight is naturally that much greater. Nor, then, shall I conceal my pleasure at coming from a country which, according to the opinion polls, is the country which puts enlargement highest on the agenda. It is encouraging to hear from Mr de Miguel about the considerable progress that has been made during the Spanish Presidency. We must express our thanks for the significant contribution that has been made, just as we must thank Commissioner Verheugen for his tireless efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also heard about the hurdles which remain and which must be overcome: agricultural policy, Kaliningrad, the Cyprus issue and the Beneš decrees. The question is, whether the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Great Britain are to be added to the list. Do not allow them to stand in the way. Let us not lose this historic opportunity to reunify Europe for the sake of freedom, peace and security.</p>

They are important reports with which I identify. I have also listened with great interest to what Mr de Miguel and Commissioner Verheugen have said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on the factors which might have been slightly overlooked. One of these is the approval of the Irish referendum; we must endeavour to work out what might happen in the future. If it is not approved, which I am sure nobody wants, we cannot tell the candidate countries, after all their efforts, that it was just a joke.</p>
<p class="contents">This is undeniably an historic opportunity for Europe to be reconciled with its past. It is clear that a response needs to be found in any case and it is right that we reflect on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The other factor is the cost of enlargement, which should be compared with the cost of not going through with enlargement. Anyone who thinks that enlargement does not involve higher costs has quite frankly not done his sums properly. Clearly, we also need to make the public understand the reasons behind some of our decisions. The issue of upstream decisions, with which our citizens are quite unfamiliar and to which they are largely opposed, was mentioned just now, and rightly so. Here, however, greater effort may be needed on the part of all the European institutions, not just Parliament and the Commission, for it is unthinkable that enlargement should be reduced to merely the opening or closure of a set of dossiers. It is a decision that must have the backing of our fellow citizens but it is an opportunity which we cannot consider rejecting if we genuinely want positive developments for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect I agree entirely with the report drawn up by Mr Brok, whom I congratulate.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I want to focus on one of the candidate countries: Bulgaria. In my view, Bulgaria has been approaching the process of joining the European Union very seriously since political stability was achieved with the last elections. I must therefore state that the Bulgarian authorities are making a great effort to continue in the right direction with the enlargement negotiations and the country’s specific adaptations so that it can become a European Union Member State within a timeframe that is both convenient for Bulgaria and possible for the Union. We all want this timeframe to be as short as possible, although, as we say in Spanish, ‘the sun is not hurried by early risers’.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I want to emphasise certain aspects that worry us. First, the social aspect: of course the Bulgarian economy has to adapt, but it must be done by keeping the basic principles of social cohesion, such as the fight for equality and against unemployment, poverty and marginalisation, to promote jobs, benefits and social security.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of the environment, we highlight the need for all units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant to be closed down by the appropriate dates and also for the Bulgarian Government to make a firm commitment to environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we urge the government to remove all legal obstacles that still allow people to be marginalised, because of their sexual orientation, for instance. It is unacceptable that articles like Article 157 should still be in force in the Bulgarian legal code. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the European Parliament, we want to make a full and complete contribution to peaceful enlargement. Negotiations of individual chapters are making good progress in many fields and the Council presidency is really making every effort to get formal negotiations with the candidate countries concluded by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural chapter is one of the biggest topics for negotiation and along with regional policy and budget matters certainly one of the most difficult areas. For me, one of the most important points is still the much criticised question of phasing-in the countries seeking accession. But I fully support the Commission proposal concerning phasing-in. Particular attention also needs to be paid to ensuring that the acquis communautaire<span class="italic"> </span>is actually transposed into practice. Only products that satisfy the same requirements as those of the EU Fifteen must be allowed on to the internal market. The quota system must be maintained as an important instrument of control for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress how deplorable it is that such slow progress is being made with setting up Sapard payment agencies. So far, they have been set up in only seven candidate countries and regrettably only a small amount of the funding has been disbursed since Sapard was implemented in the 2000 financial year. We must do more to encourage the new Member States to create the administrative conditions necessary for adequate financial management for decentral administration without losing sight of the targeted nature of the aids.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am glad that the Commission is aware of the difficult situation in the border regions and is investigating the socio-economic situation in those regions. I personally welcome that very much and would like to say in conclusion that a common Europe can only come about through intensive cooperation and that the European model of agricultural policy must also be safeguarded for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know it is not only a question of money; it goes far beyond that. It is a question of peace on this continent, a question of standards, a question of security for the people who live all over this continent.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to meet a challenge as great as the one before us, we must not only have the political will, but we must also ensure that the policies we make are backed by those for whom we make them, namely the people. That means they must have confidence, and confidence exists when they have the feeling that things are also being handled in a proper and orderly way when it comes to funding these issues. In that connection we must say that this enlargement will demand something of everyone. Those who dream of advancing without any difficulties through landscapes in bloom fail to understand the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to subject the financing of enlargement to very precise tests, which means that we are not issuing any blank cheques for the acceding countries, but we do not want to set up any hurdles either. We very much welcome what the Commission has proposed. In the matter of the structural funds, one of the areas where most expenditure is made, we are pleased that it has followed the approach taken by Parliament and intends to adopt a Regulation similar to what we are doing with the cohesion fund in order to make it easier for the candidate countries to absorb the funds. But we also say very clearly at this point that this model is a model for transition. We will not be creating a cohesion fund here that, in the future, will give rise to another model or to another fund that will then never run out but, insofar as it is possible to move over to the normal structural fund, that is what we shall have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of agricultural aids we support the Commission. We agree that the rural areas should be seen as targeted units. We also believe that direct aids are now part of agricultural incomes and that up until 2006 there is a simple model that can be funded, is clear and that we can also support. For the time after that we shall have to give thought to how it is to look. There are no blank cheques today, because we know the financial framework only up to 2006. At this point we can guarantee full support. After that, it will be necessary to think again. But that also demands something of those conducting the negotiations. We will give them very critical but constructive support.</p>
<p class="contents">We take a similar position on foreign policy. Anyone looking at future developments in external aid must count on things happening that cannot be foreseen today. As an example I will simply mention Kaliningrad. Here we shall of course also be subjecting the European Union’s external aids to very critical scrutiny, but we are very much convinced that this is possible and that, here, too, we will be able to make progress accordingly. Citizens can be assured that between now and 2006 there will be no discernible problems. For the time after that there will have to be proper negotiations. All who sit round the table carry a heavy responsibility. As a Parliament we will have a part in deciding how things will move forward, and we will be looking at that very closely. But we will also be following these questions very positively because we believe that European Union enlargement is the task of the future to which we must apply ourselves, where everyone must know where we are heading, where we must first talk about how much we are prepared to pay, but we will always take a constructive and positive attitude, as we have up until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not only in the light of enlargement, as the 12th Annual Report on the Structural Funds 2000, the Cohesion Fund and the Instrument for Structural Policy for Pre-Accession shows, as the rapporteur has rightly said, that there is substantial underutilisation of commitment and payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the lowering of targets, concentration and simplification of planning, take up of the new forms of intervention for the structural fund planning period has been much slower than was intended and was desirable. Even if EU Finance Ministers are currently pleased at every euro that is not spent at EU level, since it eases the burden of the EU Member States’ net payments in the short term, they are economising in the wrong place because EU money is urgently needed especially in times of rising unemployment. The reasons for the difficulties must be sought both in the Member States and in the EU Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases there is a shortage of suitable projects. Not infrequently the problem is the necessary cofinancing. But appreciable administrative bottlenecks are also a reason why the Member States are unable to take up funding. According to the Annual Report 2000, not one intervention was approved in connection with the new Community initiatives, and as a result 0% of the budget plan was implemented in this area. That is atrocious! In future, the Commission must ensure that the new planning period starts on time and it must insist that the Member States do their groundwork early. On the other hand, the Commission must also intensify its scrutiny of the implementation of programmes and inform the European Parliament in good time of all irregularities found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But there are also problems and we cannot disregard those problems if, as Mr Walter has just said, we want to take the citizens with us.</p>
<p class="contents">That is particularly so at the interfaces of enlargement, that is the border regions. Many border regions are already marginal areas with large structural deficits. It is for that reason that we cannot leave those regions alone. That is why, among other things, we have Community action for border regions, which I consider to be a very good instrument. The main section relates to transport. As we also made clear in the Sommer report, we must give regional transport a central place in that. It is not enough only to invest in TENs, because it is not only about ways from Warsaw to Berlin or from Vienna to Prague, but it is also about ways from one small town over here to another small town over there.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the second key area mentioned in this Community action, namely support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Cross-border trade is a necessary step. There is now a pilot scheme that has at last got going and I hope it will be a great success. But we will only be successful if we simplify the application procedures and if we get better coordination between support instruments, for example between Interreg and PHARE-CBC. I also want to stress here that we do not need any new instruments, but that we should optimise the existing ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must also give some thought to whether we cannot increase the proportion of cofinancing in one corner or another. Instruments like Community Action really have European added value. In border regions, people come together. They may work on one side and live on the other. This is where they can get to know each other and learn from one another. That is why we should do all we can to assist this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that they represent a damning indictment of the management of the Structural, Cohesion and ISPA Funds. It is simply not acceptable, for example, that there are many programmes dating from the 1980s and 1990s that have still not been closed. Likewise, no disbursement of funds has been made under programmes such as Urban, Interreg or Leader in the year in question. As the report implies, this has been nothing but a catalogue of errors. Recent reports by the European Court of Auditors and OLAF have revealed substantial holes in the Commission's accounts. OLAF alone has investigated cases with a value of EUR 144 million this year. Where has all this money gone?</p>
<p class="contents">It is now essential that the Commission starts to act with more financial probity, in order to retain what remains of its credibility. In view of the fact that 35 programmes from 1989 are still on the Commission's books, nine years after payments were due to finish, it is imperative that suitable measures are introduced now to bring projects in on time and on budget. Therefore, the n+2 principle should be rigorously applied across these funds, so that the European taxpayer is not left to foot the bill for projects which run on over their funding deadlines. Similarly, Member States are not blameless in this funding fiasco. It is amazing that reportedly over EUR 100 billion remains unspent, due in large part to lack of action by national governments. The UK is one of the worst offenders in this respect. I am appalled that, for example, less than 5% of available EU funding had been taken up in my own region at the beginning of the year. These funds are not and should not be infinite. If neither the Commission nor the Member State can get their act together, they should be returned to where they belong – the pockets of the European taxpayer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel this problem clearly raises the question of the European Union’s ability to determine the rights and statutes of European citizens or future European citizens with regard to the right of asylum, on the eve of the great challenge of the decisions on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The addition of the protocol on the right of asylum to the Treaty of Amsterdam prohibits Member States of the European Union from considering a request for asylum submitted by a national of another Member State. In doing so, the Treaty introduces discrimination against European citizens based on their nationality. This runs counter to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, which defines a refugee as ‘any person who [has] a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion’.</p>
<p class="contents">The grounds for the incorporation of this protocol are, on the one hand, that the Member States have to respect the rule of law, democracy and human rights and possess the internal and external legal resources to put an end to violations of these legal principles, and, on the other, that nationals of the Member States already have rights in the other Member States which render useless the right of asylum, the right to free movement, free establishment, free choice of residence and other laws relating to citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be said, however, of the recent condemnation of various Member States by the European Court of Human Rights, or the Amnesty International reports which, every year, denounce violations of fundamental rights in most of the Member States? Moreover, how can we know what the future holds and state with absolute certainty that the Member States or future Member States of the European Union are above any form of abuse? The attitude to minorities is a good example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us ensure that everyone can claim the right of asylum within the European Union. Let us ensure that everyone can have their request for asylum considered. Would that not be the best way of testing our democratic commitment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I expressly welcome the fact that we heard officially from that country at the beginning of the week, from Prime Minister Brazauskas, that Lithuania also intends to shut down the plant’s second reactor for good in 2009. That was made possible because the European Union has entered into obligations for the period from 2004 to 2006 totalling approximately EUR 245 million. But I say, too, that we shall also have to assist this country after 2006 with the entire decommissioning of the nuclear power plant. Of course I have my doubts as to whether the Union will have to pay all of the EUR 2.4 billion that Lithuania wants for that, spread over 20 years, because every country that operates a nuclear power plant in the normal way has to make provision for the time after it is closed.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I find interesting in this connection is that with respect to Ignalina we are for the first time rightly demanding something of a candidate country that cannot be found in the acquis communautaire because – lamentably – we have as yet no Community acquis concerning the safety of nuclear power plants. I consider that really to be a political scandal and I hope we will arrive at a common standard for that for the future. I hear that some members of the Council, the usual suspects, are already objecting to the closure of the plant and the reasons why they must close it being so expressly included in the accession treaty for Lithuania because they are afraid that could indirectly create an acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Commissioner De Palacio will be successful in pushing through her announced package of measures laying down for the first time common standards for the safety of nuclear installations under Euratom auspices. If we want to continue with nuclear energy, that can only be the highest standard technically possible, but I really want to use this as an opportunity to say one thing: we must not be unreasonable in asking from the candidate countries what we do not ask of ourselves. In the present case we are right to ask that, but then we within the Union must take the appropriate steps ourselves when it comes to safety standards for nuclear installations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regional development programmes are intended to promote the competitiveness of employment and the creation of conditions that will ensure sustainable development in Europe’s least-favoured regions, in an enlarged Community.

Programmes for the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and for the research and information society must be incorporated into economic and cohesion policy so that the asymmetries are not increased in favour of the richer countries.

<p class="contents">As Members of the European Parliament, we have the opportunity – especially during the forthcoming Seville Summit – to put that pressure on the Council which is obviously needed in order to make it clear what the remaining enlargement negotiations are about.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is the EU’s absolutely most important priority. It is quite unacceptable again to postpone clarifying matters and taking a stance now that enlargement is effectively around the corner. Continued delays and conflicting signals on the part of the Council concerning the ground rules in the common agricultural market for established and new Member States in an enlarged EU are in danger of causing us not to have the privilege of welcoming ten new Member States at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important in this context to bear in mind that it is not in actual fact only the EU which is to decide on this matter. Support for an enlarged EU is also required in terms of the referendums being held in the new Member States for the purpose of ratifying the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern Europe is an historic task, and the biggest and most important that any of us will ever get to experience. Anyone who tries to prevent or halt this process is assuming a very large responsibility.

<p class="contents">I feel that the proposal put forward by the Commission for the negotiations on farming is, on the whole, a reasonable one. The most controversial issue is that of the implementation of current direct aid, created by the 1992 and 1999 reforms of the CAP to compensate for the price reductions decided on at that time. Looking at the matter objectively, these countries are not entitled to receive this type of aid. This aid was created with the sole aim of compensating for price reductions. In the new Member countries, however, not only have there been no price reductions, there are even likely to be price increases.</p>
<p class="contents">The mistake the Commission proposal makes is to suggest that the current model of direct aid should be maintained beyond 2006. The current system of direct aid under the CAP was justified in the medium-term to prevent falls in farmers’ incomes. This is unsustainable, however, in the long term because, since not all forms of farm production can continue to expand, it is highly discriminatory. By 2006, therefore, we need to create a new system of aid for agriculture based on farming’s multifunctional role in society. Will this mean, however, that no aid must now be granted to the new countries of the East? It does not. I feel that the Commission proposal to present 25% of aid at this stage will be acceptable if this aid is paid out on an objective and horizontal basis – for example, on the basis of farms or of areas – without tying this to specific crops or forms of production. If this is done, the proposal will already be more technically consistent and will be fairer, both in the present and in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore absolutely essential that we should continue working to support the efforts that the candidate countries are making to restructure and modernise their agriculture, under the requirement that the candidate countries should comply with the Community acquis, but we must be quite clear that we too must comply with this Community acquis. Direct payments form part of this Community acquis and the Commission’s proposal that they be phased in, which we support, should ensure that there will soon be a single agricultural policy for the expanded European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rural development measures must ensure that there are active rural areas with diversified production in the candidate countries and especially that they guarantee employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it must be remembered that enlargement cannot be associated with the reform of the agricultural policy. Reform of the CAP goes at its own speed and according to its own timetable, and to a great extent it depends on the results of our negotiations in the World Trade Organisation and their effects on world market trends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very critical report, rightly so, and what strikes me is that our criticism is still the same as it was years ago concerning the annual reports on Structural Funds. Back in the first assessment year, the Commission noted serious delays which led to considerable underspending. Not enough attention is given to additionality, which is a fundamental criterion, after all. Member States should monitor European money as well as their own money, starting with my own government. None of this has changed, and certainly not improved, since the eighties. The amount of money that remains untouched is still enormous. This applies to both Objectives 1, 2 and 3 and to the new initiatives. I consider this to be a missed opportunity for the Union and the regions. It is perplexing that no greater attempts have been made at Member State level to spend the money available. What kind of message is this sending to the accession countries? If our Member States cannot cope with our funds, how will the new Members be able to do so? We can no longer wait for administration to be simplified. This should happen now. It is impossible for the newcomers to comply with our administrative requirements. ISPA is a case in point. As a result, the money of the funds will not be spent, and we will miss a major opportunity for development in eastern Europe. The late submission of projects within the framework of ISPA, if no technical support is offered by the Commission, should not be a reason for rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should very briefly like to broach another topic. We insist on the Commission now finally completing old projects dating back to the eighties and nineties. It will soon no longer be possible for the services of the Commission to tie up the loose ends of these projects once ten new Member States have joined. I call for reorganisation now. What does the Commission intend to do about this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to deal with the agricultural side because I want to see a proper reform of the common agricultural policy before enlargement takes place. What worries me is that we are not going to do that properly. We are going to get to a situation where the budget of the common agricultural policy does not fit the size of the new European Union. Then we will have to make cuts in places, which is perhaps not the right way to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the Commission is dealing a lot with this, but we also have to look at how we get the Sapard funds into enlargement states to help them build up their infrastructure, including their education systems. On a recent visit to Poland I found there were lots of problems with education, especially in the rural areas where very often young children were not going on to secondary school because they stayed at home to work on the farms. We must face up to the huge number of farmers in these enlargement states and we must find some way of helping them to restructure their agriculture as and when they come into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very concerned to avoid food coming into the European Union that does not meet the high standards of our production. We have to be very clear on this.</p>

<p class="contents">I welcome the participation of the candidate countries in the Convention’s work, for it will become quite clear to them from that debate that, as well as the need for good government and combating corruption and crime, as well as economic, judicial and social reform, as well as agricultural and fund distribution policies, there is another point on which the Union is not prepared to compromise: civil rights and equal opportunities, which must be non-negotiable preconditions for EU membership.</p>

Political support and the support of the people in the enlargement process is the decisive point and that can of course only be given by democratically legitimised forces such as Members of Parliament as representatives of the people of Europe. In that respect we are performing an important task here.</p>
<p class="contents">I want in particular to thank Mr Böge, the rapporteur, also as a member of the Committee on Budgets, because I think the financing of enlargement is naturally the most serious question being put to us from all sides and one which is naturally of particular concern also to the people of the European Union – just as it is in the candidate countries. I think the approach that Mr Böge has found, that we in the Committee on Budgets have found, deserves to be taken seriously. Of course whatever is available through Agenda 2000 must be included in this enlargement process, but we cannot at the same time commit ourselves for the period after that in such a manner that we no longer have any freedom to take decisions after 2007. I think that is a very wise approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very grateful to Mrs Sommer, because I think that in her report on the border regions she has managed to highlight the problems of the people directly affected by enlargement and who are already experiencing in their daily lives what it means to live in a region where there is a marked economic disparity and to ensure that we in Parliament send out a strong signal that appropriate support must be given, because we in Parliament can make those funds available in the budget procedure for 2002. It was a hard struggle, but at the end of the day we succeeded. I assume that in the 2003 procedure we shall be able to find a euro or two to make additional resources available for these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, the enlargement process needs to be carefully prepared and negotiated, both as a whole and even more so in all its many details, so that they too, being the proverbial lair of the devil, may be right. It is important from that point of view that Parliament have an associated debate to thrash out enlargement as a whole – the progress of the accession negotiations, financial issues and, last but not least, Community action for the border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this topic that numerous Austrian MEPs have, for five years and initially in the teeth of virtually universal opposition, repeatedly highlighted as an indispensable back-up measure, and they have done so for very good reasons. Now that the date for accession is looming ever closer and more and more people are giving thought to what this event will actually amount to in detail, we can scarcely restrain ourselves from indicating our agreement. To be sure, most are not only willing to agree with us, but they also, and above all, want a share in the financial resources and to share them with us. As has already been said today with reference to support for border regions, the Commission was not particularly helpful at the outset. Even now, we are not completely satisfied with the communication from the Commission. What is being provided for should be welcomed as an initial measure, but there will be a need for further steps – for which read funds – to make a wholesale success of enlargement on our side of the border as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be a need for a number of other back-up measures. Above all, we need a better <span class="italic">de minimis </span>rule, to give additional support, in the form of European subsidies, to the efforts of our Member States and regions at restructuring using their own resources. Only when that happens will people in the region immediately adjoining the border be able to say ‘yes’ to enlargement with a clear conscience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The speeches made by Members confirm my belief that we are all agreed on one thing, namely that we want enlargement of the European Union, and we are working at every level to realise this objective in a responsible manner. The timetable is an ambitious one. The end is in sight, although chapters on such things as agriculture and regional policy have yet to be sorted out.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in this context, refer back to yesterday, when farmers from the present Community demonstrated in front of the parliament building. They presented the concerns that they have about their future and demonstrated about the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. What they were concerned about was a fair chance for their businesses, and thus for their families, in the future. What made the greatest impression on me was the solidarity our farmers showed with their counterparts from the future Member States, despite the adverse situation they themselves have been put in by falling prices for milk and cereals. This was for me an appeal for everything possible to be done for the people in the present EU and in the candidate countries not to be left alone with their concerns and needs. So we too have to talk about their problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take Sapard as our first practical example. The flow of funds here is quite inadequate. They should be kept for agriculture and rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the funds that continue to be needed for the development of rural areas must be provided by all the structural policy measures and not just from the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, full harmonisation is absolutely necessary in the internal market. I will stop there and thank you for listening, as there are a few people who have been waiting a very long time already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and the applicant countries must prepare for enlargement in a way that avoids needless delays in the start-up of programmes and so that the money set aside for these preparations can be used effectively. The Structural Funds must also be used in a way that is as uncomplicated and efficient as possible. There is much room for improvement here, which is evident, for example, from Mr Turco’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid must be allocated and staggered so that the funds get to the local players as directly as possible and primarily to the poorest regions of all. Structural work must adopt the principle of phasing in increased batches of aid. It is reasonable to use the Cohesion Fund in the early stages, but in the future the programme-based financing share must be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Skills, know-how, new technology and good levels of networking between SMEs and regional players are essential in implementing effective regional policy and promoting the positive impact of enlargement. The particular challenge is not so much the adoption of Community legal provisions but their implementation and monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Besides, I am not going to tire this House, because it would be the seats that get tired, anyway, since there is practically nobody left except the long-suffering European Commission, which, of course, has been sitting here, like the Presidency, for these five hours without a break.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say that we have taken very good note, because naturally that is part of the exercise: the Presidency has taken good note of everything the honourable Members have said; I cannot say I agree with everyone, but I have gathered some very important points.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must tell you that enlargement has been a priority for our Presidency, and it will continue to be one for the Seville European Council, and we therefore hope we can draw some conclusions to further this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the road map we had to follow, all that is left for us is to conclude a consensus, that we hope we can reach, in order to achieve a common position on agricultural matters. If, for any reason that I can understand, this consensus that we are going to fight for in the Council cannot be reached, I imagine that the countries that do not subscribe to the common position will answer politically to this Chamber and to European public opinion. This is because I think the subject of direct payments, as can be deduced from the Commission proposal, forms part of the acquis and is not for discussion, and therefore it is not good for accession to be conditional upon a hypothetical or future reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a subject that I do not want to prejudge; there is always room for hope and for seeking a formula that pleases everyone, and that is precisely the Presidency’s objective: that everybody should be able to find their own position and solve their own political problems. I am convinced we shall succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too would like to thank you for the broad support with which the Commission's proposals have met in this debate. I just want to address one or two points, and do so briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the Sapard programme, which was referred to by a very large number of speakers in the debate. I would, firstly, like to point out that seven programmes are currently up and running; the great question is, of course, in which candidate country. I am able, though, to give you the good news that another country is to be added this month, namely Poland, which is to be given more funds than the other seven countries participating to date. You can take that as an indication that it is a bit too simple to concentrate only on percentages and amounts. This way of looking at things must, I believe, take account of the differences between the candidates, and also, of course, of the need to establish a system that will subsequently meet, for example, with the approval of this House's Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that the introduction of this system has been very demanding in terms of effort, and that it has also resulted in delays, but it is not true that these setbacks and delays can be laid only at the Commission's door.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you something of a warning against resuming the debate on an INRA programme or whatever the thing is called, by which I mean a warning that we would only be delaying matters still further if we were now to start a debate about amending the financial legislation or even the Financial Perspective, or if we were to invent new bureaucratic structures that first needed to be developed. I do, though, understand that the concerns of civil society are having a greater influence on the administration. We will have to do some thinking about that.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that a very large number of you have mentioned the agricultural reforms. Let me make it quite clear that I am committed to them, and have always affirmed that we need them, and that agricultural reforms are a process with which we have to press on. I only hope, when we in the Commission decide on our proposals for the mid-term review on 10 July, that they will meet with just as much approval in this House, especially from all those who have, today, called for further reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to reiterate that conflating the enlargement process in any way with further agricultural reforms or even making the one dependent on the other will not just create difficulties for enlargement, but will delay both it and further reforms. We are therefore firmly convinced that the two must be kept separate and progress made on both of them without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having taken part in the debate with, so to speak, the aid of Mr Barnier's ears, I would like briefly to respond to what has been said about the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The outflow of resources is unsatisfactory at the moment, but it is not quite true to say that major delays are occurring; it is simply that the Member States are, as it were, delaying implementation until the last moment at which the legislature has allowed them to put the programmes into operation. Parliament played its part in enacting the regulations in question.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the debate on the financial framework for enlargement, let me, as Budget Commissioner, reiterate that, in producing its proposals, the Commission has had to be guided by the principle that a proper balance has to be struck between the interests of the present Member States and those of the new ones. It is my opinion that we have succeeded in achieving this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">When the proposals were put forward, the new Member States initially complained that they were not receiving equal treatment. Although we provided for direct support to be phased in, the Commission proposal envisages that, as early as 2006, the financial obligations in respect of the new Member States should, in per capita terms by reference to the population, be equal to those in the present Member States, so that there is equal treatment already.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission proposal put the present Member States under excessive financial strain?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me observe that we have kept strictly to the limits of Agenda 2000, and that we in the Commission have, in addition, proposed that the new Member States should make contributions to the EU Budget from the very outset, something that the Council has accepted. That means that the net cost to the present Member States is even less than the amount stipulated in Agenda 2000 as the maximum burden resulting from enlargement. I think it is important not to lose sight of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise one more thing. The reports we are considering, and our debate today, sometimes give the impression that the costs of enlargement will be borne only by the present net contributors. That is false. All the present Member States will be paying the same amount in relative terms towards enlargement, leaving out the special arrangement for Great Britain. The same effort, though, is called for as an expression of solidarity. As Member States differ in size and gross domestic product, that of course means in absolute terms that 80% of the enlargement costs will in fact be borne by the five largest Member States: Germany, Great Britain, Italy, France and Spain. But this is a joint effort for the sake of solidarity, and the financial aspect is of course of great importance in public debate, and also in debates in Parliament, the Council and the Commission. However, it must not be forgotten that this debate is not about whether or not to build a new stretch of motorway, but about the unification of Europe. It is about the stabilisation in Europe of peace, democracy and the rule of law. One cannot put a price on values such as these.</p>
