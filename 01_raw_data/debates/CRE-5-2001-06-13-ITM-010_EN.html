For example, can you imagine life with no aeroplanes and no cars?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on Europe's oil supply, which is exceptionally important in content and most daring in form, Mr Linkohr's report on it, the opinions of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has done me the honour of appointing me as draftsman, are clear and, to a greater or lesser extent, all come to a number of revealing conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, at current rates, the worldwide consumption of oil will rise from 77 million barrels a day in 2000 to 115 million barrels in 20 years, i.e. it will almost double. Secondly, specialists forecast that the maximum [output] will not exceed 90 million barrels a day and that the number of new fields discovered will continue to dwindle. Thirdly, Europe is totally dependent on oil imports. The present figure is 75% and it is expected to top 85% in 2020. Fourthly, the price of crude oil is expected to remain high, at least 22 to 28 dollars a barrel, and will most probably continue to rise. I this is combined with the high value of the dollar, the cost will inevitably rise, making European products less competitive, due to the high rate of tax on petroleum products in the European Union. This, of course, will exacerbate inflationary pressures. Fifthly, huge numbers of people die in road traffic accidents, almost as many as the number of people who die in major wars. Sixthly, 70% – I repeat 70% – of the atmospheric pollution of our planet is due to transport and only 7% is due to industry and we should refrain from misleading criticism which only targets industrial pollution, given that cars and aeroplanes cause most of the pollution on our planet.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have checked and there is still time, I should like to finish my point because I think that this is an important issue. Oil is, however, a valuable commodity in other important sectors, such as the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, as it is a non-renewable source of energy, we should not waste it. If all this is true, and this is what the Commission report tells us, then what we need to do is obvious, but it is also extremely difficult. In the long term, we – and the European Union in particular – must look for alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas, hydrocarbons, of which there is an abundance on our planet, nuclear energy – concentrating on nuclear fusion – and of course, sustainable sources, of which solar energy is the most important.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, and I am almost finished, the European Union must look for oil and natural gas from several geographical sources, especially in the Caucasus. We also need to try and reach an agreement with OPEC on more stable prices and payment in euros rather than dollars and, at the same time, to increase our safety stocks.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Linkohr (PSE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, if we had held this debate on the oil supply of the European Union six months ago, far more attention would probably have been paid to it and a host of journalists would have been here so that they could report on it the following day. I doubt if this will be the case today because things have calmed down somewhat since.</p>
<p class="contents">Surprisingly, back then, when oil prices were indeed rising, albeit not so dramatically, the streets were full of protesters and if a country had held elections, the government would probably have had terrible trouble getting re-elected; even though there is nothing they can do about it, psychologically it makes a huge difference. People were confused and many took to the streets in anger.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly is my point here? My point is that oil policy can have an extraordinary effect on public opinion in our countries and we must be take care when talking about oil. Obviously, people are getting used to higher prices. The price of oil has since risen to 30 dollars a barrel, yet there is no revolt – at one time, even that rise would have constituted a danger.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am trying to say here is that this is not an insignificant issue and we should make an effort to help stabilise prices – knowing full well that prices will, of course, tend to go up before they go down over the next few years, due to the shortage of oil and for ecological reasons, and that abrupt changes are dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission published a communication back then, on which I should now like to congratulate it. I think it is an exceptionally helpful and intelligent communication and I think the most important message – and it is this message which I also want to get across in my report – is that we need proper relations with OPEC. We need dialogue with OPEC and, more importantly, we need the European Union to speak with one voice in this dialogue. Not with fifteen, with one. I am pleased to pay you the compliment, Commissioner, but I would have said it anyway: it must be the Commissioner who speaks for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can imagine that the band which OPEC is aiming for will be pegged at between about 22 and 28 dollars a barrel. Even 30 dollars would not be a catastrophe, even if, because of inflation, we would, of course, be more comfortable with 25 rather than 30 dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">So where are the bones of contention, including here in Parliament? First, there is the question of tax harmonisation, of the harmonisation of duty on mineral oils. I am an ardent advocate of this sort of harmonisation, although I know that many of my fellow members take a different tack, believing that tax policy should be subject to competition. However, I think it is absolutely essential and fair, in the interests of truck drivers and haulage companies in competition with each other, that we harmonise competitive conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second divisive issue that is causing problems is the use of stocks. Now I too know that these stocks, which we have estimated at 90 days, are, of course, minute compared with the size of the oil fields underground and that releasing these stocks will have little impact on the cost of energy. I am not so naive as to have overlooked this. However, I believe that it makes sense, psychologically, to release them in a crisis, but I admit that we could argue the point.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point we need to discuss – and I am being very cautious here – is the use of fiscal instruments in the event of a crisis. If you object that this is highly adventurous, then I would remind you that the French government granted tax relief back then, contrary to European directives, and has kept it in place to this day. In other words, we have to deal with a real situation here, which we cannot allow to put us under pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">What gives me food for thought is that OPEC stands together with the USA on climate policy. In other words, they are a partner in the US alliance, which could be dangerous when it comes to climate policy. I really would like to be able to discuss climate policy with OPEC. I think that we could well broker a compromise here.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Linkohr has described the circumstances in which oil prices fluctuated abruptly and erratically and has pointed out that a whole series of countries took measures which were out of kilter both with the rules and principles of the European Union and with what we are debating today from the point of view of sustainable development, because we must not forget that the debate is not just about this report, it is about the huge task of the Swedish presidency and the Gothenburg summit as regards sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the topical subject of Ireland is taking centre stage, we should not forget this fundamental approach. I particularly welcome the fact that the President of the Commission said quite clearly today that sustainable development is one of the cornerstones of development in the European Union, including a transport policy geared towards sustainable development. This also includes, as Mr Linkohr said, a price policy which prevents erratic fluctuations but which does not follow the populist line of: the lower the price of transport, the better. No, what we need is a pricing system and structure in the transport sector which is keeping with transport policy objectives, especially where oil is used. And the transport policy objectives, as the Commissioner also sees them, consist of shifting more traffic from the roads to the railways wherever it is possible and makes sense to do so. When we have adopted a railways package, when the Commissioner has proposed the additional measures which we are waiting for, then it will make sense overall to boost sustainable development by shifting traffic, especially freight traffic and passenger and local traffic, on to the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to mention here is planning policy. We know it cannot happen overnight but I think – and this too is contained in the Linkohr report – that we must urge individual Member States to think in their future planning policy about providing public transport which is as efficient and environmentally-friendly as possible wherever land is developed and houses, factories etc. are built. This too is important if we want to ensure that sustainability is not just dead letter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a balanced report with workable suggestions on how to improve the intermittently precarious oil supply situation. That it is precarious can be seen from the spike in prices which occurred last autumn, or as is occurring now with Iraq's decision to stop oil exports. It is precarious because we depend on supplies of oil from unstable parts of the world. It is intermittent because these crises endure for relatively short periods as market forces come to bear and rectify the situation. Indeed the volatility of oil prices, ranging in the last 18 months from USD 10 to 34 per barrel, is as much a problem for the suppliers as it is for the consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">This gives us an opportunity, because stable prices are of interest both to us in Europe and to the oil supplier countries. We should make a much more consistent effort to develop a dialogue with the oil supplier countries, with the Middle East, with Russia, with the Caspian and Caucasus countries and with West Africa. This dialogue must not just be pursued when there is a shortage, or when there is a seller's market, or when it is in our interest. It must be pursued also when the boot is on our foot, when there is a glut and a buyer's market. As a practical example, Europe should encourage and facilitate the construction of oil and gas pipelines from these places to the heartland of Europe. Nor should we overlook the potential of our indigenous oilfields, notably those in my Scottish constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">Research and investment and improved recovery techniques have already extended the life and productivity of the North Sea and continental shelf oilfields. But more can still be done. We must also pursue opportunities for saving energy, above all in the transport sector. Yes, we must do what we can to promote renewable and alternative energies. But we cannot share Mr Linkohr's enthusiasm for harmonising tax rates and using harmonised tax, applied at European level, and the manipulation of strategic oil reserves to regulate oil prices. Tax rates are for the Member States to set and clearly they are quite unwilling to sign up to the long-delayed directive on taxation of energy products. Taxes on energy should be set in the context of an open competitive European market which, in itself, will ensure that fuel costs are not too far out of line from one country to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to hobble our economies, our industries and those who live and work in our rural and remoter regions. Yes, oil supply is a matter which has to concern us. The Commission's communication and Mr Linkohr's report are valuable contributions to understanding the problem and defining possible solutions. If we can succeed in amending the few unacceptable aspects that I have detailed, this group will be pleased to support Mr Linkohr's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur mentioned, the hike in oil prices just over a year ago gave us an indication of how easily Europe could be destabilised by the speculative manoeuvres of the major oil exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, Europe has been unable to take coordinated action because of its great dependence. Today, therefore, it is particularly crucial that we adopt a coherent strategy to allow the European Union to provide this security. In 2000, Europe imported 75% of its total oil requirements and by 2020, this figure will reach 85%. We must, therefore, take steps to reduce our dependence. These measures include, first of all, diversifying our supply sources and we must develop long-term strategies for the Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Caucasus regions, if only to limit the influence of OPEC. In this connection, we have just cause to welcome the European Commission’s energy initiatives in the context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. The European Union has everything to gain from stepping up the dialogue, by means of the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing our dependence on oil exporting countries can also be achieved by diversifying the energy sources. I am thinking, of course, of sources of renewable energy and biofuels. I am also thinking, however, of nuclear energy, even though I know that many people here are opposed to this. Of course, we must obviously stress the need for research in order to minimise the production of waste and risks to safety. Gas may also represent an alternative energy source and I support the proposal seeking to carry out a feasibility study on the construction of new oil and gas pipelines between the Middle East, West Africa and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of our strategy must focus on the rational use of energy and I welcome the Commission’s proposal to submit to the Gothenburg Council a plan for energy savings and diversification of energy sources, which will aim at more efficient use of energy. Lastly, transport is a sector that deserves all our attention. According to current forecasts, the transport sector will account for 71% of demand for oil by 2020 and, as rapporteur, I note with interest the request from Mr Linkohr to carry out research under the Sixth Programme for Research and Development.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I also believe that tax harmonisation has an important role to play in the strategy that I have just mentioned and I support the proposals that have been made on this by my fellow Member, Mr Linkohr. I would, moreover, like to end my speech by offering him my warm congratulations for his work and for his skilful approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group supports the main points of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s dependence on oil imports is increasing worryingly while, at the same time, the availability of oil is decreasing and its price rising. The goal of the Union’s overall strategy must be to seek to reduce Europe’s dependence on importing energy. At the same time effective dialogue is required with groupings of oil producing countries, exactly as stated in the report. In this context I would like to mention cooperation with Russia. Among other things the gas and oil resources of the Barents Sea area are an important reserve also in terms of European energy provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should also seek more decisively than previously to replace oil with other sources of energy. Renewable energy sources and biofuels in particular can replace part of oil consumption and at the same time promote the Kyoto objectives. This requires that the Union direct more of its resources than previously towards researching renewable energy and promoting its use. Nor should we overlook local renewable fuels whose renewability can be successfully proven, such as peat, cork waste and olive stones, for example, depending on the geographical area.</p>
<p class="contents">An important means of reducing dependence on oil is also saving energy. One example is taking into account energy aspects to a greater extent in construction and transport. The simplest way of saving energy is to improve the energy efficiency of buildings by harmonising building regulations towards energy efficiency. At the same time, oil-based raw materials can be replaced by renewable materials such as wood, for example. In the transport sector, oil consumption can be reduced by better planning, new technology, environmentally-friendly means of transport and by investing in research into fuels to replace petrol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree on the importance of far-sighted policies. When oil prices rise we conserve energy, when they fall we do not. This has been very short-sighted, as I am sure the Commissioner will agree. Energy saving and the rational use of energy must be part of our strategy for security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has rightly pointed out that it is possible to save large quantities of oil using existing technology. Around 20% of production could be saved simply by using energy-saving windows. Oil is a costly, non-renewable energy source, which should not be used wastefully. I therefore support the Commission's proposal to submit to the Göteborg Council a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources aimed at more efficient energy use.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more important is the transport sector. Here the emphasis on biofuels and renewable energies is most welcome. We need to develop a new generation of vehicles. Energy consumption in the transport sector is our greatest problem. The report makes very welcome proposals here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Group cannot, however, agree that nuclear energy is safe or an acceptable replacement for oil. Instead, let us have the same kind of investment in renewable energy that we have seen in nuclear energy over the past 40 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the report under discussion makes no attempt, in my opinion, to address it from the point of view of the interests of the people of Europe. The objective of its basic approach is to enhance Community imperialism within the framework of competition with the United States of America. Certain objectives, such as restricting the power of OPEC and drawing up a long-term strategy for the Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Caucasus regions, are evidence of a multi-faceted policy of imperialistic intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the rapporteur acknowledges that the crisis in 2000 was not a real supply crisis. In fact, subsequent developments proved that speculation by monopoly groups and heavy taxes in the European Union were to blame for high prices. Nonetheless, the report attacks tax cuts and proposes that taxes be harmonised upwards, concealing this anti-grass roots measure beneath a mantle of environmental sensitivity. Of course, everyone agrees that we need to develop energy-saving technologies and promote renewable energy sources. However, the oil supply problem cannot be resolved within a neoliberal economy in which the more we consume, the greater the profit.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that only a fully nationalised energy agency can take charge and make proper use of existing energy sources in each country, taking account of both the economic cost and environmental protection, while safeguarding the interests of the people. This is a highly political issue and has to do with the facility for centralised planning within an economy in which the people own the means of production in sectors of strategic importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is one of the ways of preventing greater dependence on imported oil.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the dialogue with oil-producing countries could lead to a greater diversity of suppliers. This welcome spreading of risk prevents individual countries from assuming too much power in the European oil supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission and rapporteur are using the dialogue as an instrument for more stable price development. However, this is easier said than done. Moreover, both the use of strategic supplies and excise measures are not sufficiently convincing as price instruments. The risk is that these price instruments might only delay the synchronisation of supply and demand because the market does not highlight the incentives sufficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">There are solutions other than price management. For example, it could be examined whether a greater surplus capacity in the refineries could offer solace. Greater capacity can meet an increase in demand without the immediate need to put the prices up.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, diversification according to the type of energy source is necessary, as proposed by the Commission and rapporteur. That is why other energy sources need to replace natural oil in the sectors where that is possible. Natural gas and renewable energy sources can thus contribute to a greater diversity of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, sustainability is more than simply promoting renewable energy sources in a focused manner. National sustainability strategies provide the market with a variety of policies providing additional cover. At European level, it is important to avoid a situation where this diversification in terms of energy sources and geographical origin leads to competition at the expense of environmental standards and working conditions. A first step in this connection is a certification system for type and origin. Specific national policies are then possible for each energy source. In the enlargement process, this approach might meet the need for flexibility for both Member States and candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the pursuit of low prices to the exclusion of everything else will lead to countries with the lowest cost price dominating the market. That is why price management must not be the main issue of the dialogue. The preconditions for a reliable and sustainable energy supply, on the other hand, should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a welcome contribution to the wider debate on security of supply of energy in Europe, on which I am working at present. I should like to pick up on four points.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding paragraph 1, calling for effective dialogues with supplier countries, earlier this afternoon I attended a meeting where we heard about the work of the Energy Charter and the importance of putting that framework in place, in particular for our trading and investment relations with Russia as a primary source of oil and gas. I would like to emphasise the importance of that initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, paragraph 7 calls on the EU to make greater efforts to replace oil as far as possible. I support that paragraph. There is great potential and we are looking forward to hearing from the Commission later this year with proposals to encourage bio-fuels and other alternatives as a supplement – and perhaps a complement – to oil at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, paragraph 27, on a different tack, urges the Commission to encourage enhancing production of oil in Europe through improved techniques of extraction. This also must surely be a sensible policy to make the best use of our own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, paragraph 30 calls on Member States to work on the housing and transport sectors as areas where we can dramatically improve our energy efficiency and our conservation of energy. These both have to be a sensible approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it seems to me that perhaps the most important thing we have to do – which is a challenge ahead of us – is to influence and change public opinion on the need for conservation and efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, however, we are not dependent on oil but dependent on cars and transport. This is what we are dependent on, this is what will soon consume 70% of oil. They also surround this building, all the European Parliament buildings and all the offices, the same vehicles which consume our oil. By the way, who has ever heard of car-free offices? There is no such thing. Engine technology can be changed and fuels developed but the most efficient solution can be achieved by reducing traffic or by switching to rail, as has now been suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes more energy-efficient windows. That is a good saving. It would save 20% of oil. We did this in Finland as far back as 25 years ago – triple glazing. What next?</p>
<p class="contents">Transporting energy is one problem. I support local forms of energy. In Finland, for example, 30% of the land area is bog. We use less than one percent of this and it does not have to be transported anywhere. These are the right solutions. Therefore, for us using the annual growth in peat makes sense.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is clear that these savings will not be achieved in time. Renewable energy sources are not sufficiently fast. Therefore, we will have to do something else and as far as I am concerned this is either nuclear power or natural gas. Let us choose natural gas, it can be found in the north in the Barents Sea area as Mr Pohjamo said. There is an incredible amount of it there, more than in the Caspian Basin. It could be the high point of the northern dimension. I thank the Commissioner for the energy dialogue with Russia but it has to be speeded up. My proposal is to focus on cooperation between the Union and Russia which will create shortcuts. Russia’s partners are large and they are used to shortcuts. They will enable us to gain speed and at the same time develop legislation. Besides, there is a war going on in the Caucasus and there is peace in the north. There is nothing there except polar bears and silent Scandinavians. This cooperation would work and would secure energy provision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A parliamentary debate at the witching hour, just before the witching hour. I apologise for being late, as were other fellow Members, but I do have an explanation. We look around and think, hardly anyone is here and the few that are here, who were here before and have already spoken, evaporate like ghosts which materialise somewhere else shortly afterwards and then disappear again.</p>
<p class="contents">If this were merely a ghost debate, it would not much matter. But we are taking about taxes, transparency, democracy, the substance of a modern economy and mobility. Luckily we have a Harry Potter among us, played tonight by Rolf Linkohr, who is doing his best to ensure that we make some sort of progress here and who has a watchful, unwavering eye for fundamental principles of which many of us are simply no longer aware, fundamental principles for our present society. The fact that only 11 Members are still here says much about both the strength and the powerlessness of this Parliament. Nonetheless, the debate is a central debate, when you think what the problems are, and there are three problems, I think.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there is the problem of democracy, social justice and ecology in Europe. Even if we manage to achieve the breakthroughs which we need in the area of democracy and maintain the tendency towards an equitable mix in the social fabric, the huge ecological question still remains. And this is the subject of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">One point in this report demands our attention because it is, I think, a really important point. I refer to Amendment No 6 which, if it gets through plenary – and I hope it does – will change a general proposal to the Council into a clear demand to push ahead, at long last, with tax harmonisation. Tax harmonisation, especially in the energy sector, is an absolute priority if our citizens are to understand that we have converged not just socially but democratically too. We must put a stop to imbalances whereby a truck driver from Austria, for example, is exposed to totally different conditions of competition than another driver a few kilometres down the road in Germany or France. This is where we call on the Commission and, more importantly, the Council, to do something.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will make some headway here via this energy report. Without transparency there can be no democracy, not even in Europe. That is why I am ardently in favour not just of accepting the report but also of pushing ahead with tax harmonisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Linkohr for his excellent report, which is in line with the Communication on the oil supply that the Commission adopted in October 2000, which in turn continued an initial statement that had been passed on to the Council previously in September. I would like to also point out that in the mean time the Commission has adopted the Green Paper on the security of energy supplies which is so closely linked with this document and, of course, with Mr Linkohr’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that today, although we are not in such as tense situation as we experienced last autumn, the reality is that brent prices are reaching 30 dollars per barrel and that, following the conclusions of OPEC last week, the price situation continues to be a cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The cause of this volatility can be determined to a large extent, and currently it is mainly due to the low level of reserves, which have been historically low since the winter of 1999/2000. However, it is, without doubt, also due to something else which is the lack of transparency in the oil markets. In this respect, as Mr Linkohr rightly points out and has put as the first point in the motion for a resolution that he is presenting to Parliament, dialogue with the producing countries, whether or not they are members of OPEC, is an obligatory step to take in order to solve the problem of the instability of oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we need to be able to make a joint commitment that will enable us to make an analysis of the markets with these countries and establish a permanent dialogue. As Mr Purvis said, it is not about only talking when there is a shortage of oil and the prices are very high, but also when the prices are low. This would therefore maintain a connection that would enable us to offer transparency for the market and maintain a greater stability of prices, which is in the interests both of producer and consumer countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the key issue is that Europe should be able to speak with one voice and that we should not find ourselves, as unfortunately sometimes happens in the field of energy, with a country taking a position that is outside what was agreed the day before – and this happened not long ago. In this context, facilitating the development of production within the European Union, as has been said here and is advocated in the motion for a resolution, but also in countries outside OPEC and not in the European Union, would benefit the Union. This includes issues such as cooperation on energy between the European Union and Russia, through the dialogue launched by President Prodi at the European Union-Russia summit on 30 October in Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">However we can say, in any case, that our options for energy policy should be focused on controlling demand, both in terms of oil and the other energy sources. On the one hand, our energy sources are limited, on the other hand, neither can we forget our commitments on the environment (and I am talking in particular about our Kyoto commitments) on which we undoubtedly have a different position to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">But going back to our Communication, aside from the dialogue that we referred to at the start, it stresses increasing the coherence of national policies between the different countries of the Union. We must, therefore, consolidate our common approaches, both in terms of the strategic reserves and taxation. We need to strengthen the mechanisms of strategic oil reserves by pooling them, and secondly, in terms of taxation, as Mr Linkohr’s report rightly says, we need to resist the temptation to absorb the rise in oil prices through a reduction in tax on oil products.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an approach would go against our objectives in terms of the environment, particularly those arising from the Kyoto Protocol, and would mean transferring tax resources to the producing countries. As a result, we should think more about bringing the special taxes in the different Member States more in line with each other and, in this respect, I think that we should move towards a broad range as the most appropriate option, whereby there could be a combination of a certain margin for the countries of the Union but, at the same time, with greater coherence and fewer distortions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention reducing the impact of oil on the European economy and, consequently, controlling demand, and remind you, first of all, that although it says in paragraph 23 of your motion for a resolution that we are going to present an energy saving plan in Gothenburg, ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to present it. What we plan is, as part of the Green Paper that is being discussed in Parliament, a series of energy saving measures. What we will do in Gothenburg is present one of the proposals in an articulated manner. For example, a proposal on improving the energy performance of buildings, a sector in which, as one of the speakers said, there is a great deal of potential for saving energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and given the growing demand for oil from the transport sector, we need to re-balance the relative importance of modes of transport, and this is going to be one of the focal points, if not the focal point, of the White Paper that I hope will be adopted by the Commission in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission also aims to promote support for the new generation of vehicles and alternative fuels, and we will soon present a communication on alternative fuels, which has been discussed here, and a directive in which we will put forward a proposal on the minimum level of use of biofuels and another on tax relief measures to encourage the use of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the oil crisis has awakened and stirred public opinion on the problem of energy. However, this crisis comes at the same time as other major challenges. I am thinking about issues such as our increasing foreign dependence and the problem of climate change. All this has led us to engage in a debate, an overall, systematic and comprehensive discussion through the proposals put forward in our Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that with this debate and the motion for a resolution in Mr Linkohr’s report we are laying the foundations for what should be the conclusions of the future Green Paper and, in this respect, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again on the excellent work that he has done and thank all of you for your contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
