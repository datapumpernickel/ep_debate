<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to repeat what I said on a previous occasion. One of the main objectives of the 2004 budget will be the smoothest possible integration of the new Member States. We shall therefore be spending the whole year working on a budget for probably 25 Member States and on this basis we shall be taking a political decision in December.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report we speak of the position that Parliament must take in the conciliation procedure and a number of main subjects traditionally have a part to play in first reading conciliation. First of all we have agriculture. The margin of 1.4 billion currently calculated is positive, but all the items in the agriculture budget are based on a dollar-euro rate of 1.07. This is probably on the low side and so we are also looking to the letter of amendment at the end of October, which will also contain the conclusions of the agricultural negotiations in Luxembourg. What are the financial consequences of this rate?</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this point, Parliament has set a number of priorities for the agriculture budget in the form of pilot projects or preparatory actions. In the first place we think that, given the number of outbreaks of infectious animal diseases in the last ten years, there is a great burden on the agriculture budget. In future the agriculture budget will not have the margins that it has had in the past. We therefore think that very serious thought must be given to some form or other of insurance system against infectious animal diseases and some or other European animal disease fund will have to be created. We want to make a start on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, future payments to farmers will be based not only on historical actions, but also on the environment, method, on cross-compliance: one good turn deserves another. All well and good, but these environmental indicators are not all that precise. Mrs Wallström has unfortunately disappeared, but there is much to say about the nitrate directive. Something has to be done about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Other points that we consider important are the development of better vaccines against infectious animal diseases and a quality policy for agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">As for fisheries, the most important point is that the Council, which regrettably is very sparingly present this evening, must as soon as possible take a position with regard to the financing of the reforms that were agreed in December of last year, in particular with regard to the scrapping fund that is mentioned therein. We think that in principle credits must be made available for this. Otherwise better control of the quota and more research into fish stocks are the main points for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Common foreign and security policy. The Council promised to give Parliament information about this policy as of 15 June. This information had not arrived by the time of the printing of this resolution. I understand that it was handed over here just an hour ago. We shall be examining it closely. We think that we should be informed about everything, not only about the actions, but also about the budget of the European Parliament, as well as about the budgets of the Member States themselves. Both are communicating vessels and cannot be seen separately from one another.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the structural funds, we think that the N+2 rule must be applied. We also think it interesting to hear precisely what the estimates have been that are given to the Commission by the Member States each year so that the Commission can draft a good budget. It is always interesting to make this comparison. We should like to have this information from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point for this budget: we want to promote economic development in the new Member States. We think that this can for example be done through the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and through investments in these new Member States. We are therefore expecting good cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London and with the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg. We shall be raising this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have a number of other points, Mr President, but since you, given the lateness of the hour, were so insistent that I keep to my time, this I shall do. Perhaps the position of the Parliament will emerge later in the resolution itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission adopted the preliminary draft budget for 2004 – a historic budget that will, for the first time, cover an EU of 25 Member States – on 30 April and I presented the preliminary draft here in plenary session on 13 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow we will begin the trilogue, that is to say, the actual negotiations. This trilogue traditionally concentrates on expenditure for the agricultural, fisheries and common foreign and security policies, the compulsory expenditure. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his comments. I will not discuss all the points in the report right now – for reasons of time and because talks are continuing today and tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by noting an important point of agreement; this is that we want to reach agreement on the budget for 25 Member States by December 2003. Although the budget resolution can for the time being only be adopted formally for the budget for the EU of the 15, there should be complete agreement on the amending and supplementary budget for the 10 new states in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Adjustment of the multi-annual programmes is also important in the light of enlargement. The Commission has made a proposal for the adjustment of the amounts, and this is now the subject of intensive discussions in the various parliamentary committees. It is, however, important that we settle the procedural questions now so that agreement can then be reached on the amounts and the legislative changes can be made as quickly as possible. With regard to the pending legislative procedures, I would like to return briefly to the legal basis for granting support to various institutions – the A-30 lines. This is also extremely urgent and I am hoping that the Council will deal with it quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a brief word on the various areas of expenditure that will be the subject of the trilogue and which Mr Mulder raised. In October, the Commission will as usual be presenting the adjusted expenditure estimates for agriculture, which will of course take into account the outcome of the Luxembourg agricultural compromise, which contains higher expenditure for 2004 than that suggested by the Commission. So far as the proposal for insurance for farmers against various risks is concerned, the Commission has commissioned a study of the matter and I am informed that the findings will probably be available this summer. The Commission will then make the conclusions known and I hope I will be able to tell you more at Parliament’s first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to expenditure for fisheries, cuts have been made here only in the area of research, and this was the outcome of the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Research Programme, in which Parliament was involved. EUR 55 million are now available for fisheries research. Regarding the fisheries agreements themselves, the Commission has informed Parliament about renegotiations and the estimated costs and here, too, we shall be looking at how far the amounts provided will need to be modified in a letter of amendment in October.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed an increase of 8.4% in the budget line for the common foreign and security policy, in order, among other things, to again fund the expenditure for the special envoys from this budget line.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word about pilot projects and preparatory actions; you say in your report, Mr Mulder, that the margin of EUR 80 million is not very great. I am actually proud to have been able to rescue the EUR 80 million margin, given the various things my colleagues wanted in this category. If we make good use of this area for pilot projects and preparatory actions and cooperate as closely as we did last year, I think it will be possible to agree on good projects here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about the Structural Funds, which you mentioned, and the Member States’ predictions of how much money they will require next year. We are faced here with the usual situation that the Member States estimate a very much higher amount than we have provided for in the proposal. The Member States say they will need EUR 6.2 billion more. But I would like to point out that last year, 2002, the Member States’ estimates were 70% higher than the amount that was actually taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally speak about the question of the number of posts at the Commission. I think it is clear that the Commission can cope with the work involved with ten new Member States only if it has more staff. It is in all our interests, and especially of course in the interests of the new Member States, that the work is done and that it is done well. Since all the institutions are making successful enlargement a matter of the highest priority, I am confident that a good solution will be found here, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the latter I can fully support the three positions that are underlined in the Mulder report. Since the budget for external policy is approximately EUR 5 billion and that for the common foreign and security policy EUR 40 million, our committee wanted to focus attention on a number of other points than common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy seeks further clarification from the European Commission on the financial framework for the southeastern Europe region for the period 2004-2006. Although the European Commission has recently promised an additional EUR 200 million, it is still very unclear precisely where this money is to come from.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is also seeking special attention for the EU police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although the mission is being conducted more than adequately, we are receiving various signals that necessary materiel is sometimes being supplied too late or not at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our committee is seeking special attention for the additional financial needs of the wider Europe<span class="italic"> </span>initiative. Provision must be made for adequate resources for the CARDS, MEDA and TACIS programmes and possibly also for a new neighbourliness tool. It gives me great pleasure that the Committee on Budgets has taken up this and other recommendations and I should like to compliment Mr Mulder on his clear and powerful report and wish him every success in the tripartite talks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In much of it we recognise ourselves as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but at the same time we note that the credits for agriculture and rural development are falling sharply in the 2004 budget. For agriculture alone the share is falling from 40% to 36%, while there is a slight increase for rural development. In its policy plans the European Commission says that agriculture must produce with a greater market focus, but at the same time any incentive to do so in the budget is being taken away. It is not really acceptable that the amount for the promotion of agricultural products for example has been reduced in the preliminary draft budget for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition – as Mr Mulder himself has said – the dollar rate is a great risk: a rate of EUR 1.07 is being assumed and that is substantially lower than the current rate. The question is what that could mean for the budget in the long term. There has also, despite a number of outbreaks of major animal diseases, been almost no extra money set aside for possible future outbreaks.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we have started on a different policy for outbreaks of animal diseases, for example the new policy for foot and mouth disease. This means that in the event of future outbreaks the Commission might spend far less money on slaughter. As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we should like to see this money being set aside to cushion the market consequences for farmers who at the time are vaccinating without the animals being slaughtered, but who experience the consequences of this, that is lower market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the first budget for the Union of 25 Member States and in fact it is very strange that, converted to the structural funds, there is still less money available per head of population for the new Member States than for a number of existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development thinks that the money that is to be spent on rural development, in particular in the new Member States, must be expressly intended for strengthening the small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. There must be extra money for the promotion of agricultural products that meet all the food safety, animal welfare and environmental requirements and money must be set aside, perhaps through fund formation, for cushioning the effects of a different vaccination policy for animal diseases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who can help? Mr Mulder is willing, who else? The Commission or the Council perhaps? Every year we go through the rigmarole of the budget procedure again and unfortunately not everyone’s wishes can be met.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, I naturally also regret that our wishes do not necessarily have top priority. The 2004 budget procedure is, however, unusual in two respects. Firstly, it is the first one to be drawn up using activity-based budgeting; this is an improvement that I very much welcome, since it gives us a clear overview without having to spend a lot of time leafing through the budget lines, especially in the area of fisheries. Secondly, we are faced with the unusual situation that from 1 January 2004 until 30 April 2004 the budget will apply to the present 15 Member States, but from 1 May 2004, the date of accession of ten new countries, it will apply to 25 Member States. We are enlarging and have still not done our homework. The situation is alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the catastrophic state of fish stocks, last December the Council agreed, after much dragging of feet, to the reform of the common fisheries policy, not least because of clear promptings from Parliament. One of the most important features of this was the creation of a ‘scrapping fund’, which was to start before the end of this year. So far, however, the Council has not given the green light for the use of the flexibility instrument. That is hard to understand. I therefore call urgently for this point to be raised in the conciliation procedure beginning on 16 July, so that we can at least learn what position the Council takes on financing reform of the common fisheries policy. I am by no means releasing the Member States from their responsibility. But we cannot allow the Council to use the Member States’ unwillingness to provide the relevant information as an excuse for blocking one of the main purposes of the reform. Please give us your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that our group, the PPE-DE, fully supports the strategy laid out by the general rapporteur with a view to the conciliation with the other two institutions. We believe that this first conciliation is of great importance, given that it is the first real exchange of requests and strategies between the three institutions, and I therefore believe we have proposed a conciliation strategy which will be particularly useful and beneficial to the interests of the European Parliament and of the European citizens in general, which is the reason why we are here.</p>
<p class="contents">From this strategy which we are taking to the conciliation, the report by Mr Mulder, I simply wanted to highlight certain points which are the subjects of our group’s amendments. In particular, with regard to fisheries, we have heard the explanations given us by the rapporteur on budgets of the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs Langenhagen, and we fully agree with them. We believe that the Council must fulfil the commitments which were established for the financing of this scrapping fund, not only in 2003, but also in 2004, and that is why we are proposing amendments to the Färm report and also the Mulder report, although we know that they will possibly not be accepted by some of the groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We attach so much importance to this that the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will form an integral part of the delegation from our group which will go to the budget conciliation, because we want to stress how important the issue of fisheries commitments is to the Committee on Fisheries, to Parliament in general and to our political group.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another issue which we wish to highlight is the application of the N+2 rule, which has been discussed earlier. Our argument – and this is expressed in our amendment – is that there is a need for an assessment. We believe we are at the beginning of the process of applying the N+2 rule and, therefore, rather than making value judgments about what approximation the Commission should carry out in the application of this rule, what really interests us is to be given an assessment of how it is being applied, what the initial results are and, on that basis, to produce a common strategy in this Parliament on the application of the N+2 rule on the part of the Commission in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a report that is very cogent, very concentrated and which we very much support and welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure which we shall now be entering in the next three weeks with the Council and the Commission will continue to exist for a short time. We hope, however, that it will soon be a thing of the past. If the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure were no longer made – and there is much in the Convention to suggest it will not be – then something Parliament has been advocating for many years would actually become reality and we would no longer need this advance mediation. That would be a good development and I hope we shall see it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the individual points. So far as agriculture is concerned, a number of matters are raised here. I want to concentrate on a number of questions. First, the move to increase support for rural areas provided that there is a stronger focus on those areas in the new Member States than we had in the EU of the 15; we expressly welcome this. In view of the current debates – in Poland in particular, where ministers have resigned because they are evidently missing the opportunity to actually create the structures there that will allow the money to be used properly – I believe that all states must understand that no money can flow if the relevant structures are not in place. That must be made abundantly clear, and we shall be watching to see that the money is used according to the rules. All we can do is urge that the foundations be laid for it here.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as insurance against eventualities such as disasters in agriculture is concerned, we are willing to look very closely at the survey and the expert report. Some Member States already have voluntary insurance for such contingencies. They would of course be penalised if the European taxpayer were to be called upon to cover these things elsewhere. We will examine this without prejudice and we are willing to act, but we will of course not go blundering blindly into anything either, because we have to know what the long-term consequences might be.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as fisheries are concerned, I heard very clearly what Mrs Langenhagen had to say and we have always been prepared to support fisheries and the scrapping of ships where necessary. We are not, however, going to write any blank cheques, and we are not going to give a few million euros away in advance for a programme that has not been finally evaluated and on which the Council has not taken a position. We will do the same as we have done with other programmes in the past, such as scrapping in Portugal and Spain. In those cases, we wanted to have the full programme first and we said we would evaluate it and would then say how much would be made available for it. We will proceed no differently in this connection than we did with the Portuguese and the Spanish, even though we are now looking at other regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of increases on the common foreign and security policy. I would point out once again, however, that cooperation in peacekeeping is more than just peace enforcement as provided for in the Petersberg tasks of common foreign and security policy; it is also conflict prevention, and we do not support the envisaged reduction in appropriations. In this matter, we want to continue as before. Prevention is better than having to use military means to clear up afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say something about the question of payment. The N+2 rule was introduced by us all and there was a point to it. Wanting to check whether it is right at this stage, before it has really come into play for the first time, is quite out of order. This N+2 rule must be applied, and those who fail to spend their money accordingly must know that there are consequences. Showing them a way out at this early stage would amount to killing the N+2 rule and we will not go along with that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to thank Mr Jan Mulder, as a member of my own group and as general rapporteur, for an excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year’s budget is legally problematic, as for the first four months the EU will be a community of 15 Member States, but will expand to comprise 25 Member States from the beginning of May. Because each Member State has to be able to participate in decision-making affecting itself, the budget for the enlarged Union cannot be finalised until after enlargement. The budget’s principles of universality and annuality, however, require that it should be drawn up immediately for the whole year. For that reason the solution sought, where the budget will be dealt with, as appropriate, in December, with the part that concerns the new Member States not being finalised until there is an Amending Budget next May, is the proper way to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget has also now been clearly presented as an activity-based one. This will clearly separate operational expenditure, administrative costs and responsibility for implementation for each policy area. This is an excellent reform. It will increase the budget’s information value and facilitate its monitoring. This system, however, should be improved, for example by including all administrative expenditure in the budget for each policy area, as the report points out.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest weakness in the preliminary draft budget is the meagre amounts for payment appropriations. They represent just 0.99% of the Gross National Income of the Member States, which is the lowest they have been for 17 years. At the same time outstanding commitments have skyrocketed and at present are reaching the EUR 126 billion mark. This is an increase of EUR 15.4 billion on last year. If we want to achieve a balance in EU budget policy, commitments and payments have to be balanced. This will mean improvements in administration and simplified systems at all levels.</p>

I concur in general terms with a large proportion of the rapporteur’s quantitative analysis of the amounts suggested by the Commission in its preliminary draft. Even so, I want to take this opportunity to mention a deep and widespread concern at the fact that the preliminary draft budget for 2004 is the smallest, in relative terms, since 1987. It represents less than 1% of the Community’s gross domestic income, and I want to point out that such a low level of expenditure is utterly incompatible with the political ambitions so often claimed for the European Union. It is also incompatible with the ambitions which should be priorities in the current climate of rising unemployment and socio-economic recession.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a logic of constraint, stemming in particular from the Stability Pact, with which we are not in agreement, just as we are not in agreement with the systematic budget reductions made perfectly obvious by the rapporteur’s insistence on the restricted application of the ‘N+2’ rule. The cancelling of authorisations and the policy of redistributing and anticipating expenses underpin this restrictive logic. These practices have not only become common: they also detract from the integrity and transparency of the budgetary process. That is why I can only restate the need for new financial approaches as one way of resolving this situation, which is totally unsustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has already been said, the Commission has based the expenditure on agriculture on too low a euro-dollar rate. Can the Commission give an indication of the expenditure at the current exchange rate? I support Amendment No 2 to increase the resources for the fishing vessels scrapping fund. The Commission must then however exclude any form of capacity expansion or subsidisation from the structural funds, otherwise it is just banging your head against a brick wall. The drop in the structural funds for the current Member States I applaud. Strict application of the N+2 rule is necessary, otherwise the reservoir of commitments will endure artificially.
