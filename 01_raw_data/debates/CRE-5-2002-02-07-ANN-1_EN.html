<p>A document sent by ACSA to members of the Swedish Riksdag on 11 December 2001 reported that the Turkish authorities had closed the Protestant church in Diyarbakir pursuant to a decree issued by the Interior Ministry. The Turkish State is continuing to close Christian churches and parishes. The police in Gaziantep closed the local Protestant church on 23 December 2001 and a preliminary investigation has been opened against the parish representatives. On 6 January 2002, the police closed the Protestant churches in Mersin and Denisli and a preliminary investigation has also been initiated against the parish representatives in those towns. The authorities have also reportedly demanded the closure of a number of Protestant churches in Istanbul. So far, the parishes concerned have refused to comply. It remains to be seen whether they will be forcibly closed. The pace of closure of Christian parishes and churches in Turkey is being stepped up and, despite its status as a candidate for EU membership, Turkey apparently continues to flout the international conventions to which it is a party, and its obligations.</p>

<p>1. To date, the Council has had no knowledge of the facts you have mentioned.</p>
<p>2. In its 2001 periodic report on the progress made by Turkey towards accession, the Commission concluded that, in relation to religious freedom, there were signs of greater tolerance towards certain non-Muslim communities. However, the Commission also alluded to the difficulties faced by Christian churches, especially with regard to property relations.</p>
<p>3. Within the framework of the close monitoring of the application of accession partnership, which includes amongst its medium-term priorities an improvement of the conditions for religious freedom, the Council constantly reminds Turkey of the need for it to respect the commitments it has made. If necessary, the Council reserves the right to appeal to the Turkish authorities in the event that there is evidence that guarantees of full religious rights are not respected and in the event that problems of this type persist.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0013"></a>

The Commission is also invited "to report on the implementation of the proposed measures, on the basis of the information provided by Member States" before the end of 2005, "and then regularly thereafter to consider the extent to which the proposed measures are working effectively, and to consider the need for revision or further action".</p>

<p>What steps has the Council taken to verify the conditions under which prisoners taken during the Afghanistan war are being held by the USA in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and to ensure that the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war is being strictly applied? What steps has it taken, or does it propose to take, to persuade the USA to withdraw its naval base from the Guantanamo Bay area of Cuba? Would the Council agree that such a step would help harmonise relations between Cuba and the USA?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council reaffirms the importance that every detainee be treated humanely in accordance with general standards of international law. The Council is not in a position to ascertain whether the conditions of detention at Guantanamo meet those standards solely on the basis of media reporting. The Council does not dispose of the information necessary to determine whether the detainees at Guantanamo should be regarded as prisoners of war. It recalls that Geneva Convention III regarding the treatment of Prisoners of War stipulates that in case of doubt, a detainee must be awarded the protection of the Convention until such time that a competent tribunal could determine his status. In the meantime, detainees are to be treated humanely, receive proper medical care, clothing and food. The detaining power is entitled however to take such measures as are necessary to ensure the security of the facility and the detainees.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross has been granted full access to the detainees and will be in a position to exercise its mandate.</p>
<p>The question whether the withdrawal of the US Naval Base from the Guantanamo Bay Area of Cuba would help harmonise relations between Cuba and the USA is a matter for Cuba-USA bilateral relations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission's White Paper on the European transport policy for 2010 has already been the subject of an initial exchange of views by Transport and Environment Ministers on the occasion of their informal meeting under the Belgian Presidency in September last. On that occasion, issues pertaining to sustainable mobility were at the heart of the debate.</p>
<p>The Commission has already tabled - or will do so in the near future - a number of proposals pertaining to the specific measures proposed under the action programme in the White Paper.</p>
<p>As a result, the Council has initiated work on the proposal for the revision of the Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. The purpose of the changes is to refocus the priorities for Community action on measures which are most likely to provide a rapid but sustainable response to the problems of bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Concerning the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Council expects the Commission to present, before the Fisheries Council on 8 April 2002, a "roadmap" for the implementation of reform together with a first batch of proposals, on the general principles of the CFP, on fleet policy, on fisheries control and on external fisheries relations. The target is to have a policy debate and possibly a set of Council conclusions, pending the progress achieved, as work will continue at the June meeting of the Council</p>
<p>The specific question of the Honourable Member suggests the establishment of 24 mile exclusive zones in order to protect the interests of coastal populations and to enhance fisheries control. At this stage, the Council can only say that it cannot undertake any commitment in this regard as within the framework of the current reform process, the Council is bound to decide by 31 December 2002 whether to maintain the specific arrangements for the 12 mile zone.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0022"></a>

<p>Since the CAP was first established, improving the viability of all types of farms, including family farms, has been one of the Council's central concerns.</p>
<p>The Berlin European Council of 24-25 March 1999 recognised that Agenda 2000 will permit the development of a multifunctional, sustainable and competitive agriculture on a Europe-wide basis, in such a way as to make, above all, an essential contribution to the vitality of the countryside. The Council will accordingly examine, in a constructive spirit, all proposals which the Commission considers it desirable to submit over the next few months, in the context of the mid-term review of the Agenda. The proposals for particular sectors will be examined in detail in the framework of all the areas of agriculture production for which there is a common organisation of the market.</p>
<p>The author of the question will be aware that the reform of the COM in sheepmeat was adopted by the Council at its meeting of 19 December 2001 (Regulation 2529/2001), and that as things stands no such arrangement exists for wool.</p>
<p>The Council is committed to the terms of the undertakings made at the Cork Conference on prospects for the countryside in Europe, which subsequently bore fruit, in the context of Agenda 2000, in Council Regulation (EC) No 1245/1999 on support for rural development. It intends to launch, during the coming months, a debate on the future of these undertakings.</p>
<p>Over the first half of 2002 rural development will be one of the Council's priority areas in the field of agriculture, in line with the positions set out in the work programme presented by the Presidency to Parliament's Committee on Agriculture on 7 January 2002.</p>
<p>In support of this commitment and as an illustration of the importance given by the Presidency to this subject, it may be noted that the informal Council of EU agriculture ministers to be held in Murcia from 27 to 30 April 2002 will centre its discussions on the subject 'Analysis of the future of rural development policy'.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0028"></a>

<p>In 1998, the Commission published a communication<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> aimed at launching a dialogue among the Member States with a view to combating undeclared work which, according to data at the time, accounted for some 15% of the Union's GDP, while in Greece and Italy the figure exceeded 20% of GDP.</p>
<p>Recent investigations by the Greek authorities, together with other available data, reveal that 10.5% of businesses are not registered with the Social Security Institution and that the percentage of non-registered workers fluctuates between 21% and 30%, resulting in a loss of billions of euro from the public purse and, in particular, the social insurance funds.</p>
<p>What commitments did the Member States make as a result of the dialogue launched in 1998? What progress has been made? What are Greece's commitments and what recommendations have been made to that country? What measures will the Council take to combat undeclared work, in the context of the qualitative employment policy and the open coordination method, to ensure that pension schemes remain viable?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council shares the concern expressed by the Honourable Member of Parliament about the extent of undeclared work in the Union and its impact in terms of the loss of tax revenues, though the Council would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Parliamentarian to the fact that the fight against undeclared work remains in the first instance the responsibility of Member States.</p>
<p>In accordance with the 2001 and 2002 employment guidelines, Member States are encouraged to fight against undeclared work and to further the transformation of such work into regular employment, making use of all relevant means of action, including regulatory measures, incentives and tax and benefit reform, in partnership with the social partners.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is undertaking with the Member States an impact evaluation of the European Employment Strategy (EES). It is widely recognised that the EES is to continue its role as the key instrument for promoting the Lisbon agenda, which aims at full employment, competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. There is no doubt that in this context the fight against undeclared work will be an important issue.</p>
<p>On the sub-question on pensions, the Council would like to point out that the common objectives agreed for the new open method of co-ordination in the area of pensions include raising employment as a way of ensuring the financial sustainability of pension systems. Evidently, increased employment is socially beneficial if it is regular employment subject to taxation and social insurance contributions. Measures aimed at reducing the extent of undeclared work and at bringing such economic activities into the official economy can therefore make a significant contribution to the financial sustainability of pension systems.</p>
<p>6. The open method of co-ordination leaves it to the Member States to determine the appropriate policy mix that is required to achieve adequate and sustainable pension provision in a context of ageing populations. It is clear that the Council cannot prescribe, within the context of this open method of co-ordination, the specific measures to be taken by Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The section of the Spanish Presidency's programme concerning enlargement of the EU (last paragraph) proposes to encourage Turkey with its pre-accession strategy in line with the conclusions of the Laeken European Council. The Presidency also notes that the strategy should mark a new stage in analysing Turkey's preparedness for alignment with the acquis, and, if required, set new objectives in the accession process..</p>
<p>Could the Council describe this new stage in greater detail? Could it specify the possible new objectives of the Presidency and explain how the above relates to meeting the Copenhagen political criteria, which must be fulfilled before accession negotiations can be embarked upon?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Spanish Presidency's work programme for enlargement with respect to Turkey is fully in line with the Laeken European Council conclusions, which note that Turkey's progress towards complying with the political criteria "has brought forward the prospect of the opening of accession negotiations" and which state that "the pre-accession strategy for Turkey should mark a new stage in analysing its preparedness for alignment on the acquis".</p>
<p>The Laeken European Council endorsed the recommendations made by the Commission in its enlargement Strategy Paper 2001 regarding a new phase of the pre-accession strategy for Turkey. The Commission in particular recommended to start a process of detailed scrutiny of Turkey's legislation, focussing on a number of precise sectoral issues to be examined by experts in sub-committees. The EC-Turkey Association Committee, which met on 24 January last, agreed on priorities to that effect and established a schedule for the sub-committee meetings, which are due to be held from March to July this year. The results of this legislative scrutiny will have to be assessed by the Commission, and possible conclusions with respect to "new objectives in the accession process" may be drawn as appropriate in the light of this assessment. This exercise does not affect the requirement for all candidate countries, including Turkey, to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria before accession negotiations can start as reaffirmed by the Helsinki European Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It is the Presidency's intention to discuss the implications which basic education (primary and secondary education), improved access based on equal opportunities, and other central questions linked to education, all have in the sectorial approach in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p>2. For this Council discussion, the Commission is to forward to the Parliament and to the Council a communication on this subject. The Presidency's objective is the preparation of a resolution to be adopted at the Council on 30 May 2002 ("Development") which should contain the Council's views on the policy to be followed in this field.</p>
<p>3. At this stage, it is not possible to give more details on the eventual results of this debate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0055"></a>

<p>The Commission has announced that it intends to bring forward a communication for a Community strategy on health and safety at work in 2002 focusing on ways of reducing the number of accidents, deaths and injuries as well as tackling ill health.

<p>The Commission intends to come up with a new Health and Safety Strategy in the next two weeks. This Strategy forms a central part of the Lisbon Agenda in order to improve quality of work and increase quality of products, thus enhancing competitiveness of European businesses. It will develop a global approach to achieving complete physical, mental and social well-being at work. It will be taking into account changes in the world of work and emerging new risks, and it will be integrated across all Community policies.</p>
<p>The main overall objective is to reduce the number and rate of work-related accidents and illnesses across the Union. Due to the occupational accidents and diseases during last year, more than 350.000 persons have been obliged to change jobs or to reduce the length of their working time and almost 300.000 suffer different levels of permanent disability of which 10.000 have been permanently excluded from the labour market.</p>
<p>The Strategy will therefore place much emphasis on the consolidation of a prevention culture, using different instruments and policies, and based on strengthened co-operation between all actors in the field of health and safety at work.</p>
<p>The Strategy will deal with the particular risks for younger and older people, the problems related to small and medium-sized Enterprises, specific risk sectors, new orms of work, and emerging risks such as musculoskeletal disorders, stress and certain psychosocial problems. The Strategy will also take into consideration the continued increase in female employment and the gender dimension in health and safety provisions.</p>
<p>The document will provide for further co-operation at international level, with various international organisations, as well as bilaterally with the Mediterranean countries and the countries of the Mercosur. A special co-operation and exchange of experience in this field will be established with the United States.</p>
<p>The new strategy aims to reduce the unacceptable toll of accidents and diseases by a combination of traditional and innovative instruments at Community and national levels. Legislative initiatives will be launched when appropriate, for instance to adapt existing standards to the evolution of knowledge and techniques, and to address new challenges, such as mobbing and harassment in the workplace. The Commission will propose a strengthening of the Employment Guidelines by requesting Member States to adopt national targets for reductions in the levels of accidents and occupational diseases. It will also promote best practice in the areas of corporate social responsibility as well as of social dialogue.</p>
<p>The development of a real prevention culture is of particular importance. Raising awareness, life-long learning actions and the integration of health and safety issues in the education curricula from an early age and throughout school are fundamental.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the Parliament and the Council will actively contribute to the success of the new strategy by providing the necessary political support in order to make the objectives set a tangible reality.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0052"></a>

<p>On Christmas night 2001, following an outbreak of fire in unit 2 of the Ayios Dimitrios electricity generating plant, there was a leak of toxic substances, including PCB and chlophen, which exposed the workers, firefighters and the local population to health hazards in the form of dioxins. The manufacturers, ALSTOM, have as yet failed to respond to questions concerning the inherent dangers of the substances contained in the condensers and did not even ensure that they were replaced in good time, while the Greek electricity board, DEI, has not taken any safety precautions to protect the workers, who - with the firefighters - had not even been informed of the risk they were running.</p>
<p>Do the presence of PCB and chlophen in the condensers, the failure to inform the workers and the emergency services thereof and the failure to take appropriate measures constitute breaches of Community legislation?

<p>The Commission does not have any details on the causes and circumstances of this accident and the levels of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), chlophen and dioxins suffered by workers, firefighters and the local population.</p>
<p>The following Community directives are applicable in this particular case:</p>
<p>- the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC;</p>
<p>- the Carcinogens Directive 90/394/EEC (as amended);</p>
<p>- the Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC.</p>
<p>While the Greek legislation that has been communicated concerning the first two directives has been judged to transpose them correctly, the Commission is currently analysing the national legislation relating to the Chemical agents directive.</p>
<p>These directives clearly establish the employer's responsibility in terms of providing the relevant information to workers and lay down the preventive measures to be taken to avoid the occurrence of this type of accident.</p>
<p>Therefore, and without prejudging the results of the investigation to be undertaken by the competent national occupational health and safety authorities, it can be stated that the failure to inform workers and the emergency services of the inherent risk from those toxic substances, to assess the risks and to take the appropriate measures constitutes, in itself, a breach of Community legislation.</p>

<p>The issue of child poverty and social exclusion is already a central concern in the Open Method of Coordination on poverty and social exclusion. It is highlighted in both National Action Plans and in the recent Joint Report on Social Inclusion which was endorsed at the Laeken Summit in December 2001. It is thus certain to be a key concern during the process of reviewing the Nice objectives and drawing up a framework for the next round of National Action Plans in 2002.</p>
<p>However, the Commission recognises that the first round of National Action Plans, while containing much about child poverty, often lack a coherent and strategic approach to the issue. Only the United Kingdom and Portugal set clear targets. Most lack indicators of child poverty against which to measure progress. The general weaknesses in the National Plans when it comes to consultation and participation are even more stark when the position of children is considered. The next round of National Action Plans will provide an opportunity to develop a more coherent and focused framework for tackling child poverty.</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of providing statistics describing the situation of children, this has been part of the work undertaken over the past year on developing common indicators. In particular the list of common indicators on poverty and social exclusion which was endorsed at the Laeken Summit includes an indicator measuring the percentage of children (under the age of 15) living in risk of poverty. There are also indicators on early school leaving (for the age bracket 18-24) and single households at risk of poverty. The major new household survey, Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), which is currently being put in place by Eurostat, will contain a wealth of information pertinent to the position of children.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0033"></a>

<p>The Union has repeatedly expressed its deep concern regarding the human rights situation and the increased use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. At the last sessions of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, on 29 March 2001, it stated that “the EU continues to be deeply concerned about reports of torture and other inhuman treatment or punishment, the increasing use of the death penalty and amputations, discriminatory laws and prohibitions of, or restrictions on, fundamental freedoms”.</p>
<p>In response to this Union's statement the Saudi Arabian Government indicated that the allegations against the Kingdom lacked credibility and failed to recognise the country’s cultural and legal characteristics. It also claimed that the report disregarded the fact that the Kingdom’s aim in applying its laws was to protect the security and stability of its citizens. The Commission regrets this rather defensive nature of the exchange so far on human rights. While of course recognising that there are specific aspects to take into consideration in every country, it cannot accept that they justify any derogation or departure from fundamental and universally applicable principles of human rights, including the ban on torture and degrading or inhuman punishments. It will continue to try to develop a constructive dialogue on human rights matters with Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The Union reaffirms and fully recognises Israel's inalienable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. But the best way to achieve this is through the establishment of a viable, independent and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>Of course the Commission recognises that with the current state of violence in the area, Israel has real and legitimate security concerns. The scourge of terrorism must be fought firmly and persistently. But to achieve security Israel needs the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its elected President, Yasser Arafat, both in order to eradicate terrorism and to work towards peace. The Palestinian Authority must do everything to prevent acts of terrorism, dismantle all the terrorist networks and arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of terrorist acts. But their capacity to fight terrorism must not be weakened. The Israeli Government must temper military action and stop the extra-judicial executions, lift the closures and the restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people and its leadership, and freeze the settlements.</p>
<p>The Union is seriously concerned at the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and other facilities which help Palestinians in their economic, social, humanitarian development and which are financed by the Union donors. The Union has urged the Government of Israel to put an end to this practice. The Commission does not see how this is linked to Israeli security concerns.

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the problem posed by the use of certain trade names which incorporate the name Rioja or names derived from it on the labelling of certain Argentinian wines. This problem has already been raised on several occasions in the framework of relations with Mercosur and in bilateral discussions between the Commission and Argentina.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to point out that the Community regulation in force does not currently permit the use of such names in the Union’s market.</p>
<p>It would also point out that Rioja or La Rioja is not a designation of origin recognised in Argentina.</p>
<p>The Commission, therefore, considers that this is not a case of the same name being used by different products but that, in any event, this problem should be addressed, if necessary, within the World Trade Organisation and, particularly, in line with the provisions laid down in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights – (TRIPs), most specifically in Articles 22.4 and 23.3 thereof.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, discussions between the Community and Mercosur are ongoing and in this context, it should be possible to conclude an agreement with Argentina which upholds the rights of the producers of ‘la Denominación de Origen Calificada Rioja’ [the Rioja Designation of Origin].</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to tariff issues, these are being addressed in the discussions that the Commission is holding with Mercosur and, particularly, within the framework of an agreement on wines and spirits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0953"></a>

<p>On Friday, 30 November 2001 in Toulouse, during a series of information technology study days, the chairman of France’s Conseil supérieur de l’Audiovisuel (Senior Council for Audiovisual Matters), Mr Dominique Baudis, stated that Spanish television broadcasts in Catalan (TV3 and Canal 33) and Basque (Euskaltelebista) which are received by the Catalan- and Basque-speaking populations in the parts of France which lie alongside the Spanish border enjoyed preferential conditions which were soon to be terminated.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that, on French television channels, broadcasting in those languages is merely a token affair and that French Catalan- and Basque-speaking viewers who want to watch television in their own language therefore have no choice other than to tune into programmes from Spain.

<p>Article 87(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for any aid granted by a Member State “in any form whatsoever”. Consequently, the nature of taxation involved in any given measure is irrelevant to the application of the Community regulations on State aid<span class="sup">1</span>.</p>
<p>In its communication on the application of the rules on State aid to measures involving the direct taxation of undertakings<span class="sup">2<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></span> <span class="sup">2</span>, the Commission indicated the criteria that must be met in order for a measure to qualify for aid:</p>
<p>Firstly, the measure must provide its beneficiaries with a benefit that eases the burden which normally strains their budget. This type of benefit could be provided by a reduction in the tax burden of the undertaking in various forms.</p>
<p>Secondly, the benefit must be granted by the State or through State resources. A loss of tax revenues amounts to the consumption of State resources in the form of tax expenditure. This criterion also envisages aid agreed by the regional and local bodies of the Member States.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the measure in question must affect competition and trade between Member States. This criterion requires the beneficiary of the measure to exercise an economic activity, regardless of its legal status or its method of financing.</p>
<p>Lastly, the measure must be specific or selective by favouring “certain undertakings or the production of certain goods”. This selective nature of a benefit can result from an exemption from tax legislation, regulations or administrative provisions as well as from a discretionary practice of tax administration. The selective nature of a measure can, however, be justified by the nature or the economy of the system<span class="sup">3<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></span>. In such cases, the measure is not bound by the qualifications for aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a tax measure is a form of aid, it can benefit, in the same way as aid granted in other forms, from one of the derogations from the principle of incompatibility with the common market provided for by Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. When the beneficiary – whether this be a private or public undertaking – is entrusted by the State with the task of managing services of general economic interest, the aid can also benefit from the provisions of Article 86 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>In accordance with these principles, the Commission will conduct a case-by-case examination of whether the types of tax relief described by the honourable Member do, in fact, constitute State aid and whether they are compatible with the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

General Baki Onurlubas, commander of the Black Sea region, warned in the media of the 'threat posed by the Christians' and asked members of the public to ring the armed forces 156 hotline to report whenever they saw Christians in the region. According to General Onurlubas, the Christians' anti-social intentions are clear because they have distributed free bibles in the region.</p>
<p>Prior to the National Security Council meeting, the Minister for Internal Affairs had issued a decree to all local authorities, giving them a free hand to intervene and close down Christian congregations and church premises. The decree is the reason for the closure on 1 December 2001 of the Protestant church in Diyarbakir, which was followed by preliminary investigations into members of its congregation.

<p>There are many Member States of the Union which pursue the nuclear option for electricity production and border on other Member States that do not: the examples of Denmark–Sweden, Luxembourg–France and Ireland–United Kingdom readily come to mind. Well-established procedures within the Union already serve these relations between Member States, for example the environmental impact assessment procedure related to the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, based on the Council Directive 85/337/EEC1 as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC2. On this basis, Member States already have a framework to communicate with regard to trans-boundary effects of new installations, including those of the nuclear industry. The “Melk Procedure”, established to mediate in the Temelin case, was inspired by these Directives along with further guidance under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty. Member States have often already put in place additional bilateral agreements for discussion and the exchange of information.</p>
<p>The good offices that the Commission provided in the case of the international dispute between Austria and the Czech Republic on the issue of commissioning the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant was a case where one of the involved parties is a Member State, and the other a candidate country for accession to the Union. Thus, this situation is rather unique. The good offices were called for at the explicit request of both sides in view of the international discord that had developed on this issue, impacting on the ongoing enlargement negotiations. The Commission’s intervention was also driven by the need to facilitate a Common Position of the Union on the energy chapter negotiations with the Czech Republic within the timeframe of the Road Map endorsed by the European Council of Nice. The objective of the mediation was also to transform the conflict between the two countries into a relationship of good neighbourliness. The outcome allows these countries to address nuclear issues on the basis of a formalised dialogue lasting beyond enlargement, in spite of opposed approaches to and perceptions of nuclear power. The “Conclusions of the Melk Process” are in any event a bilateral agreement which was not signed by the Commission. The outcome aimed not to make their differences vanish, but to allow for both parties to address them in a framework comparable to the friendly neighbourly relations already prevailing between the above-mentioned Member States.</p>
<p>Given the specific situation between Austria and the Czech Republic as a candidate country, the Commission does not consider the Melk Agreement as a precedent applicable in the relation of Member States. However, the Commission considers that Community law in its present state already constitutes an appropriate framework for the discussion and settlement of similar disputes between Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0972"></a>

<p>Human and democratic rights are systematically and persistently violated in Turkey, a country which is a candidate for membership of the EU. One such instance is the ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name based on the antiquated provisions of Article 96 of the Law on political parties, which dates from 1920.</p>
<p>The Socialist Power Party of Turkey was founded in 1993 and operates legally. It has fought vigorously for democratic rights and takes part in elections. At its last congress, it decided to change its name to the Communist Party of Turkey but, because of the abovementioned undemocratic law, it is in danger of being banned.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Turkish Parliament is in fact debating amending the law on political parties, which may provide an opportunity to abolish the undemocratic ban.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's view of the ban under Turkish law on the foundation and operation of communist parties? Does it consider that Turkey can become a member of the EU without first having lifted the ban? Will it raise the question of amending this undemocratic and reactionary law with the regime in Ankara so that the Communist Party can engage freely in political activity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As a European Union candidate country, Turkey has undertaken to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria. The principles of freedom of association and peaceful assembly are fully part of these criteria. These principles also cover the regime applicable to political parties.</p>
<p>In its Regular Report published on 13 November 2001, the Commission noted that "the constitutional provision on the principles to be observed by political parties has been amended. Sanctions can be imposed upon a political party only if "actions" committed by members violating basic principles, as spelled out in Article 68 of the Turkish Constitution, are endorsed by the party as a whole. Instead of permanent dissolution, the Constitutional Court may decide to bar the political party in question partially or completely depending on the gravity of the "actions".</p>
<p>At the same time, it needs to be pointed out that the grounds for banning political parties remain unchanged (Article 68 of the Turkish Constitution).</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring very closely the concrete implementation of this constitutional amendment. In this context, amending the law on political parties is of particular importance in view of complying with the Copenhagen political criteria.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0003"></a>

<p>According to media reports Continental, the German tyre manufacturer, received a total of Kr 184 million in 2001 from EU Structural Funds to invest in Portugal. Shortly afterwards it closed its factory in Gislaved, Sweden, although investment there would have been the cheaper option if no subsidies had been granted.</p>
<p>The closure of the Gislaved factory will mean that the largest private sector employer in that part of the province will disappear. Nearly 800 jobs will be lost in an area with a population of 10 000.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider this to be consonant with the objectives of EU regional aid and competition policy? If it does not, what does it intend to do to ensure that similar situations do not occur in future?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Continental Mabor company, located in Lousado in Portugal, has received EUR 3 million of Community cofinancing under the Community support framework for the 1994-1999 programming period.</p>
<p>With regard to the 2000-2006 period, pursuant to Article 26 of the general regulation on the Structural Funds<span class="sup">1</span>, the Member States must inform the Commission in advance of any aid of more than EUR 50 million granted to undertakings for investments cofinanced under the Structural Funds, providing all the information necessary for the Commission to be able to assess whether competition rules are being complied with. The Commission can confirm the level of aid proposed or decide that the project does not justify, partially or in full, the involvement of these funds.</p>
<p>For aid of less than EUR 50 million, the Commission must be notified of each individual decision taken by the Portuguese authorities and the Commission must declare whether the decision complies with the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission has not, to date, received any communication on aid provided for an investment undertaken by the aforementioned company within the current programming period. It has asked the Portuguese authorities to provide further information on the matter.</p>
<p>Decisions concerning the location of an undertaking are the responsibility of its own board of management. Such decisions are likely to be influenced by many factors and not only, therefore, by the possibility of receiving public financial aid for making new investments. In any event, any public support of this nature, whether it is Community or national aid, must comply with the Community regulation on State aid.</p>
<p>With regard to the Structural Funds, the current rules contain two measures designed to limit the effects of relocations. Firstly, the Commission has laid down, in its Guidelines on national regional aid<span class="sup">2</span>, provisions that oblige the beneficiaries of structural aid to maintain, for a period of five years, any investment or job created as a result of such aid. Secondly, and along the same lines, the regulation on the Structural Funds lays down that the funds’ involvement in production activities is to remain in place on condition that the location of these activities does not change in the five years following the decision to participate.<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>While no studies on this aspect are currently underway, the Council Recommendation of 5 June 2001 however recommends further research into attitudes and motivations of young people in regard to alcohol consumption. The Community Programme for health promotion has in particular supported a series of projects dealing with this general topic.</p>
<p>Under the Progamme of Community action on Health Monitoring, actions have been launched on improving data collection on health indicators such as on alcohol-related mortality and morbidity and on health determinants such as alcohol consumption. Moreover, one of the three main strands of action mentioned in the proposed future Community Public Health Programme, is on improving health information and knowledge, including on issues such as alcohol-related problems of public health.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission’s White Paper on Transport highlights the need for research policy for transport in Europe and, in the context of preventing traffic congestion which the Commission claims is threatening 'apoplexy at the centre and paralysis at the extremes', it proposes to provide funds (around € 30 million) for a new programme, called 'Marco Polo', to promote intermodality between the different modes of transport. Taking into account the complexity of the issues that need to be tackled in the transport sector across Europe, including in the peripheral areas, and recognising the importance of research policy for transport in Europe, does the Commission agree that it would be advisable to take this approach further and to establish a European Transport Policy Research Centre?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The White Paper on European transport policy for 2010 puts forward a set of legislative proposals designed to reduce congestion, re-establish a balance between the various modes of transport and improve transport safety and quality. The proposals which constitute a practical response to the difficulties of access to the outermost regions include the one put forward by the Commission on 4 February 2002, namely a new regulation setting up the 2003-2006 115-million-euro Marco Polo programme, the purpose of which will be to promote new services designed to encourage the carriage of freight by water or rail instead of by road. The programme will supplement the Community aid made available from the budget allocated to trans-European networks, from the Cohesion Fund and from the European Regional Development Fund for the construction of trans-European transport network infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Commission acknowledges how important research is to the development and implementation of a transport policy. Under the 2000-2006 Sixth Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Framework Programme, and in particular under the new specific programme on integrating and developing the European Research Area (both of which are currently being adopted by Parliament and the Council), a major role is allocated to transport and, in particular, to the safety thereof, to interoperability and to the development of the common transport policy. The programme calls for new ways of supporting projects and networks of excellence and will provide support for initiatives designed to make research into the European transport policy accessible on line. It will also enable the Joint Research Centre to become involved. The Commission also directly organises events designed to disseminate the results of transport research, such as the conference held in Barcelona in October 2001 on the specific issue of safety. In view of these facts and as things stand at present, the Commission sees no reason to set up a European Transport Policy Research Centre.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0021"></a>

<p>The main focus of the Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy is the sustainability of fish stocks. However, how does the Commission respond to the criticism that its Green Paper does not adequately take into account the essential nature of the sustainability of fishing communities, the fact that the fishing industry provides jobs which sustain the social structures of less advantaged areas and that by helping the fisheries sector it supports the livelihood of people, families and local economies and, in this regard, what additional measures will it now put forward to support coastal communities throughout the EU?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Ensuring that those who earn their living from fishing in fisheries-dependent regions – and also their families – enjoy satisfactory and equitable living conditions is a major objective of the common fisheries policy. Although that priority is expressly stated in the Green Paper, it is true that, in that document, emphasis is placed primarily upon the need for a rapid solution to be found to the serious problem posed by the exhaustion of fisheries resources.</p>
<p>One of the precepts of a responsible fisheries policy is that all the parameters which determine or affect sustainability must be taken into account. The most recent information released by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicates that the mortality rate for the main Community fish species needs to be reduced by between 30% and 50% (according to the type of fishing and the sector concerned) in order to allow sustainable fishing activity to continue. The Commission will have to factor this into its fisheries- and fleet-management proposals relating to the new common fisheries policy, otherwise the survival of the sector will be at stake.</p>
<p>At the same time the Commission will propose measures which will provide the best means of ensuring that fishing activities are able to continue in coastal areas which are highly dependent on such activities. These could include granting those who practise traditional fishing methods preferential access to waters and resources in 6- to 12-mile zones.</p>
<p>The Commission will also involve both sides of the industry in examining the special needs of regions in which the local population is particularly dependent upon fisheries and related activities. It will where necessary propose additional welfare measures.</p>
<p>Parliament will be kept informed of developments in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0027"></a>

<p>According to a report which appeared in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 21 January 2002 and subsequent press articles, ten Directors-General in the European Commission and their deputies are apparently to be relieved of their office and to take up new duties.</p>
<p>Why is such a shake-up being undertaken precisely now, during a year in which work of fundamental importance (EU enlargement, constitutional convention) is being carried out, and what steps are being taken to ensure that the vacant positions are filled by suitably qualified, experienced staff?</p>
<p>How does the Commission respond to the widely-held view that the shake-up is further evidence of 'weak leadership' on the part of the Commission President?</p>
<p>What additional financial costs, including in respect of pension arrangements, is the shake-up likely to mean for European taxpayers, and how are they to be financed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In September 1999 and December 2000 the Commission set out the principles and the details of policy which it had adopted on Appointment and Appraisal of senior management of the Institution. All relevant documents and decisions were published and made available to Parliament. The policies adopted as part of the General Strategy for Commission modernisation and reform specified, inter alia, that A1- and A2 officials will be subject to mobility after 5 years and will not, in any event, stay longer than 7 years in the same post.</p>
<p>Consistent with these policy decisions, on 23 January 2002 the Commission set out the way in which its policy relating to appointments of senior staff will be implemented over the coming months.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Prodi Commission's mandate in autumn 1999, the majority of the Commission's most senior officials has already changed posts as part of the policy established by the Commission. The January 23 decision will affect the remaining 15 Directors-General (DG) and Deputy Directors-General (DDG) who are eligible for mobility by the end of 2002.</p>
<p>All staff changes will be based on the principles set out in 1999: that merit is the primary factor that must determine appointments and that every effort should be made to respect the need for a balance of nationalities and of qualified women and men in the most senior posts in the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that its implementation of mobility at specified periods is in keeping with good management practise and will continually ensure that the best qualified candidates secure senior positions.</p>
<p>The Commission has declared which posts will be affected by the current exercise. In the period to May 2002 the Commission will identify and assess all potential replacements among the directly affected officials and will, where appropriate, publish posts in order to invite as many applications as possible from qualified persons. Internal and external applicants will then be assessed with the support of external expert consultants.</p>
<p>The Commission has chosen to undertake mobility changes simultaneously in mid 2002 because that offers more reallocation options to both Commissioners and officials, and because it is more efficient and less disruptive than the alternative which would inevitably be a series of changes made at intervals of a few weeks over an extended period. Furthermore, the decision is in accordance with the time schedule announced in 1999 which involved changing several A1- and A2 staff at the beginning of the Commission term and, subsequently changing others in the mid term period of the Commission (i.e. mid 2002).</p>
<p>The honourable Member will recall the very clear demands for substantial modernisation and reform of the Commission that were strongly expressed by Parliament and Council in 1999. The Prodi Commission has always acted thoughtfully and energetically on that basis, and the 23January decisions are only the most recent evidence of that.</p>
<p>The Commission is not yet in a position to quantify the costs of potential early retirement measures deriving from the current arrangements for mobility among DG’s and DDG’s since it is not possible to foresee, at this stage, how many such measures will be applied. In addition, the costs for procedures under Art.50 vary considerably and depend upon the official's age, seniority and place of residence in retirement. More information will be available after the agreed changes are completed towards the end of this year.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will be aware, the Commission has continually to engage in the very significant – indeed fundamentally important – tasks of initiation and development of policy, Treaty applications, and Union resource management activities and it has to do that every year. Those obligations of the Commission clearly mean that the necessary implementation of mobility can never be accompanied by a period of serenity. There is therefore no realistic possibility that the movement of senior management could wait for a conveniently quiet time, or that events and policy could be suspended whilst senior management was moved.</p>
<p>Far from providing evidence of “weak leadership” the current changes offer yet more practical testimony of the deliberate and determined commitment by the Commission President and the College to carry through the modernisation mission given to them by the Council and Parliament, and to do that consistently and with rigour.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0059"></a>

<p>There are a number of EU rules aimed at guaranteeing the welfare of farm animals, but such rules are frequently not complied with and animals are often mistreated. As long as this situation is allowed to continue, disregard for animal welfare could constitute a competitive advantage. One way of remedying the situation could be for the Commission to bring action in the European Court of Justice against Member States that fail to ensure compliance with the rules in force. Has the Commission any such plans for ensuring that the rules are complied with? Has it any other ideas on how to resolve the problem of mistreatment of animals?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission accepts that problems of inadequate enforcement of Community legislation governing farm animals particularly their transport and slaughter are widespread throughout the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission is prepared to initiate infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty in appropriate cases of non-compliance by Member States with their Community law obligations in this domain and has already done so on several occasions.</p>
<p>However, systematic resort to infringement proceedings is not necessarily the best way forward due to the lengthy delays involved and because evidence of individual failures is not necessarily conclusive as to the general situation in a Member State. Consequently an infringement may be difficult to prove before the Court particularly where a Member State claims to have taken action to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore in relation to Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Directive 95/29/EC relating to the protection of transported animals the text itself has given rise to serious problems of interpretation which have resulted in to enforcement difficulties.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to submit a proposal for a revised legislation on this subject later this year which will, inter alia, be drafted in order as far as possible to avoid the problems which have been experienced with the present Directive.</p>
<p>It should also be borne in mind in the event of an adverse mission report of the Commission’s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) recommendations are addressed to the Member State concerned and a follow-up procedure is initiated in order to secure compliance by that Member State with its obligations. This procedure can result in matters being cleared up without the need to resort to infringement proceedings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
