<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sasi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI)</span> Mr President, the European Union has pushed for the speediest possible implementation of the Test Ban Treaty. All EU countries, whose ratification is needed to bring the treaty into force, have complied – including France and Great Britain, which have nuclear weapons. The EU believes that the CTBT is an important step in the promotion of non-proliferation and the decommissioning of weapons, and its entry into force will be to the benefit of all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, the European Union deplores the decision taken on 13 October in the American Senate not to ratify the Test Ban Treaty. The decision reflects badly on the multilateral attempts that have been made to promote non-proliferation and decommissioning. The disappointment felt as a result of the decision was expressed, while it was still fresh in everybody’s mind, in the statement presented by the country to hold the presidency of the European Union on 13 October. There was also a resolution on the banning of nuclear testing passed at the Tampere Summit. We have also emphasised European Union support for the Test Ban Treaty in political dialogue between the EU and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">In assessing the significance of what has happened, we should point out that President Clinton still assures us that he is doing his best to have the United States ratify the Treaty as soon as possible. President Clinton has stated that the United States will, in the future, refrain from carrying out nuclear test explosions.</p>
<p class="contents">International credibility regarding the nuclear test ban is strong. There is a long history of trying to ban nuclear testing, stretching back to the 1950s. As a result of hard negotiations, a general session of the United Nations approved the Test Ban Treaty in September 1996. 155 countries have now signed the treaty and 51 have ratified it. Of the 44 countries that use nuclear technology, and whose ratification is, under Article XIV of the treaty, a condition of the entry into force of the Test Ban Treaty, in all 26 have ratified it. A strong international reaction to the nuclear test explosions carried out by India and Pakistan last year showed that nuclear testing – no matter who is responsible – will meet with clear global condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 1999 the European Union adopted a common position, whose purpose it was to strengthen EU cooperation in international efforts to bring the CTBT into force. On the basis of the common position, the EU actively participated in the conference held this year on 6 – 8 October in Vienna according to Article XIV of the treaty. In addition, the EU has been involved in bilateral discussions to promote the entry into force of the treaty with all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified it, but whose ratification is vital for the treaty to come into force. These efforts to promote the treaty’s entry into force must continue, with the relevant objectives very much in mind. The EU is appealing to all countries, and especially those, and this includes the United States, whose ratification is a condition of the treaty coming into force, to become associated with the treaty as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union considers the Non-Proliferation Treaty to be a major tool of international security that offers a set of global frameworks for the promotion of both non-proliferation and the decommissioning of weapons. The Test Ban Treaty supports this system of non-proliferation. The European Union is preparing to play a constructive role in the study conference with regard to the Non-Proliferation Treaty to be held in April – May of the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Test Ban Treaty is unique in nature. It prevents all nuclear tests in whatever place, including so-called peaceful nuclear explosions, which were the subject of a heated theoretical debate when the Non-Proliferation Treaty came into being in the 1960s. Compliance with the Test Ban Treaty will be monitored by means of a comprehensive system of verification, whose main element is a worldwide monitoring system consisting of 321 technical survey stations. The verification system also contains legal provisions that enables on-the-spot checks to be carried out when there is reason to suspect that there has been a breach of the treaty. The verification system is effective and makes it possible to check that the treaty is being complied with to a highly reliable degree. The system will support the maintenance of relationships built on trust among the parties to the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament, the European Union will play an active part in the preparatory work being done in Vienna to create an organisation for the implementation of the treaty and a verification system for it. The Union supports the efforts on the part of the CTBTO Preparations Commission to establish a verification system in good time and with the degree of efficiency the treaty requires.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Treaty, as honourable Members will know, is the result of decades of hard work, decades of determined work to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, starting with the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the late 1960s. It constitutes a key element in the international strategy to control, reduce and ultimately to eliminate the risk of nuclear conflict. Its ratification by the present nuclear powers is essential for our efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as the presidency has pointed out, has been and remains fully committed to these objectives. We have worked hard for the earliest possible entry into force of the Treaty. All 15 Member States, bar one, have already ratified the Treaty and work is under way in the 15th state to complete the procedures there.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the American administration shares our objectives. President Clinton and his team worked hard to obtain Congressional approval for ratification of the Treaty. They understood, as well as we do, how important it is for us to take the lead together in order to obtain the 44 ratifications which are necessary for the entry into force of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore all the more regrettable that the Senate voted against ratification. They seem to have done so for internal American reasons as much as on the basis of any assessment of the value of this Treaty for United States’ and international security.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and this is reflected in the motion put before us today – that they made a very grave mistake. In refusing to give their agreement to the Treaty they offer encouragement to the very states which we wanted to draw into the commitments set out in the Treaty and whose ratification is a condition for its entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">What message has been sent to Russia and China? How will this vote help to persuade countries like India and Pakistan to ratify the Treaty? This regrettable vote may even offer encouragement to other countries in their nuclear aspirations and make them cross the threshold by testing their own nuclear devices.</p>
<p class="contents">Any such nuclear tests at this stage might undo all the work which has gone into the Treaty. They would undermine international support and confidence in the multilateral arms control efforts. More seriously, they might trigger reciprocal actions in other countries through testing or through the strengthening of their nuclear programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Senate refusal to agree to ratify the Treaty is a setback but it is not the end of the road. We must now, more than ever, show our commitment to the Treaty and redouble our efforts to promote its early entry into force. This is essential in order to maintain the international momentum in favour of continued arms limitation and a stronger global non-proliferation regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has consistently supported an ambitious European Union policy on non-proliferation issues. Wherever possible, we have complemented CFSP initiatives in this area with action falling within Community competence. Under the Euratom Treaty, for example, we have contributed to the development and strengthening of an efficient nuclear safeguard system in Europe, including the Russian Federation. Activities in this field are supported by financial allocations under the PHARE and TACIS programmes. We are currently considering extending these activities to other areas such as safeguards on chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The common strategy on Russia also contains specific provisions on non-proliferation. In this context we are examining the scope of cooperation with the United States on the expanded threat reduction initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Accession to the Treaty is also a crucial element in our policy towards South Asia, as the presidency made clear. Following the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan the Commission has participated in the international taskforce set up to develop confidence and security-building measures and to engage these countries in constructive discussions on regional non-proliferation and arms control.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years remarkable progress has been made in international arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament, through both bilateral and multilateral efforts. In the multilateral context the ratification of the Treaty and the review of the non-proliferation treaty next year will be crucial to reconfirming earlier commitments and building a platform for further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this we need to work with the United States and other leading partners. The leading role played by the United States has been essential in developing the global non-proliferation regime. I hope we can encourage our American friends to take up that role again.</p>
<p class="contents">We should do everything we can to convince Congress of the importance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for ourselves, for the United States and for the international non-proliferation efforts. I can assure you that the Commission will continue to bring its contribution to this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that all honourable Members have a particular role to play in this respect. I would hope that you would use every opportunity to explain and underline to your colleagues in the Senate why they should reconsider their vote on the Treaty and how a renewed commitment to international non-proliferation and arms control will promote American security interests, as well as broader international security and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In that marvellous newspaper the<span class="italic"> International Herald Tribune</span>, there is today a shortened version of a speech given the other day to the Council on Foreign Relations by the President’s national security adviser Sandy Berger. American opponents of treaties like the one we are debating today neglected the fact, he pointed out, that the United States has already stopped testing and that the Treaty helped freeze the global development of nuclear weapons when America enjoys an enormous strategic advantage. I hope that, to borrow an unattractively appropriate phrase, the fall-out from this lamentable political decision can be contained. I know that is what the American administration wants. It is what we all want. American senators and congressmen should face up to the responsibilities of their country’s global position. It places a high premium on bi-partisanship in foreign policy in general and in nuclear policy in particular. Failure to recognise that condemns us all to live in a much less safe world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morillon (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Sasi, Commissioner, you have just reminded us, in great detail, of the importance of this Treaty Ban, the basic aim of which is to strengthen the measures of the non-proliferation treaty and, in conjunction with this, aims to keep the development of nuclear weapons under control, thereby limiting the proliferation of these weapons and of the technology necessary for developing them. </p>
<p class="contents">As you pointed out, the treaty was established three years ago and was signed straight away by the five nuclear powers which are the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. But, in order for it to come into force, it must be ratified by forty-four specifically designated States amongst which there are the states that actually have nuclear capability, and the nuclear powers, but also those States known as “threshold States”, which are States that, because they have nuclear reactors in the civilian sector, are capable of developing military technology. </p>
<p class="contents">On 13 October, this treaty was defeated in the American Senate, which rejected it by 51 votes to 48 and one abstention. This shows that the margin was very narrow and that it may therefore be useful – and it certainly will be useful – for our Parliament to make its voice heard after those of the Heads of government who, in Tampere, lamented the attitude of the American Senate, pointing out that it represented a timely signal to those who might be tempted to equip themselves with nuclear weapons. </p>
<p class="contents">Among the arguments put forward in the United States, some people thought that it was not yet time to stop nuclear testing at a time when North Korea is making efforts to develop its own weapons, and as China is continuing to build up its arsenal. Others questioned the validity of simulation and felt that in order to ensure the long-term credibility of nuclear deterrence, they should not prohibit themselves going ahead with testing. Finally, others questioned the application of this treaty which, it must be admitted, will be difficult to control even when the 381 monitoring stations that the Representative of the Council told us about have actually been deployed. There is no guarantee in the short term that they have the necessary means to detect weak nuclear explosions in an environment which does not always make it possible to tell them apart from earthquakes. </p>
<p class="contents">All of that is of little consequence, however, in terms of the geopolitical challenge that confront us, consisting of monitoring as efficiently as possible the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. I am pleased that Commissioner Patten mentioned the fact that the threat does not come from nuclear weapons alone. Having dedicated my life to the use of weapons, I know that force is in itself neutral, and that it is the way it is used that can be good or bad. The advent of nuclear weapons has at least had the merit of forcing political leaders to take stock of the risks that their jobs may entail. It was probably the balance of terror throughout the forty years of the cold war which allowed us to avoid a third world war. The strategy of deterrence may therefore have its merits. </p>
<p class="contents">If we do not manage to ban the proliferation of these weapons, we run the risk that they will end up falling into irresponsible hands. This is why, aware of this risk, I am approving the resolution which will be submitted tomorrow for Parliament’s approval.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me first of all to welcome the fact that there is virtual unanimity between the Council, the Commission and, hopefully, the Parliament, concerning such a crucial issue at a time when we have to take decisive steps in the development of the common foreign and security policy. Since we are always so self-critical, I believe that we should welcome this step.</p>
<p class="contents">And, having said this, I believe that rather than debating amongst ourselves, what we have to do is address the American Senate, and especially its Republican majority, because this is not a debate against the United States, but a debate in which we specifically support President Clinton. What we profoundly criticise is that attitude of the Republican majority in the Senate which corresponds more to the former doctrine of the “clear destiny” of the United States, much more than to the moral, as well as military, leadership which they currently hold. I must confess – with some experience of relations between this Parliament and the Congress of the United States – that in the Congress of the United States we have many friends and connections but that we have at no time been able to timetable a positive debate with Senator Helms, who does not even seem to have an American passport and who considers, not only with regard to this issue but also with regard to many others, that it is his job to impose his laws on the world. Think also of the slow and delayed attitude of the United States with regard to UN funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to point out to our American friends and partners the risk involved in this decision, because it encourages States such as Pakistan and India – with the risk of all-out war – to continue with their nuclear tests. It disturbs our relations with Russia and creates a situation which encourages those States which are on the threshold of having a nuclear capability to start again. I believe that this a blatant display of total irresponsibility. And in the Union, where we have all ratified the Test Ban Treaty, we have political and moral arguments to address to our American partners so that we can remind them that they have a serious responsibility to try to stabilise the world and that they can rely on our help if it is really possible to cooperate with them. This type of unilateral measure, which ignores the lessons of history, which puts a dramatic halt to the process which has taken many years and still needs to be promoted, is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that our colleagues in the Delegation for Relations with the United States will remind our American friends of this as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather, it is a number of specific politicians in the American Senate. We are friends of the United States. We admire the United States’ contribution to freedom and peace in the world. We have supported the United States’ and NATO’s nuclear strategy, including their attempts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And that is why, in this situation, we must have a serious word with our friends in the American Senate. It is completely irresponsible to use ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty as a political football in an internal political dispute between the Republican Congress and the Democratic President. How are we to be able to press Russia and China and India and Pakistan to ratify the treaty when our most important ally will not do so? We protested – I think Mr Morillon can remember this – when France carried out its nuclear tests in the Pacific. We protested because this damaged attempts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We need now to criticise the majority in the American Senate. We urge that the matter be taken up again. We hope due note is taken of the fact that the American Senate is today facing a barrage of criticism. It is well deserved. I hope that it leads to the issue being taken up again quickly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution which, incidentally, is supported by the European Parliament and by my own country, Ireland, sets forth a new way of thinking for effective measures to forward the cause of a nuclear-free world.</p>
<p class="contents">The American decision is deplorable and it sends out a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world as regards nuclear disarmament. The recent case in Scotland which has re-endorsed the International Court’s ruling that nuclear weapons are illegal is also interesting and has to be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to look at NATO where there needs to be a review because, as far as I can see, the US has demonstrated quite clearly its contempt for the whole issue of nuclear disarmament at an international level. These are issues which have to be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union should look again at its policy of supporting NATO and the Western European Union. Both military organisations are committed to nuclear weapons, weapons that the International Court has deemed illegal. We are supporting illegal weapons and we really have to look at this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Senator Jesse James pompously said that the Treaty is dead and buried. He is known for his fundamentalism, but he did not realise, or perhaps he realised full well, that the signing of the Treaty was the first step towards the concrete realisation of the hope that what the United States did with the nuclear holocausts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never be repeated. What a sad prospect for our century! In fact, in the country which wishes to set itself up as a moral and strategic leader, groups seem to prevail which, for the sake of profits and military and nuclear supremacy, are not afraid of destroying themselves too. Actually, maybe we should not be surprised. These groups are the same ones which continue to inflict the death penalty and not pay the amounts due to the United Nations, thereby contributing to the loss of legitimacy and functionality of a structure which was founded on the principle of peoples’ right to be free from war. </p>
<p class="contents">What the Senate has done is sheer madness and, as Commissioner Patten was saying, it may not even have been done for strategic reasons but because of internal struggles, which makes the matter worse and even more shameful. Above all, as we have seen, this is encouraging other countries which already have nuclear capabilities, not to ratify the Treaty, and inciting even more countries to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. We have seen that Russia did not waste any time, and the day before yesterday it tested a Steel RS 18 intercontinental ballistic missile. What the Japanese Minister is doing is also worrying. And China, which has carried out 45 nuclear tests, had assured us it wanted ratification to be accelerated. Now all of these things are certainly in doubt. </p>
<p class="contents">Several times, Parliament has come out in favour of an end to nuclear weapons. We must work hard to ensure that those countries which have not yet ratified the Treaty do so as soon as possible. Here are just a few examples – China, Russia, India and Israel, which is still holding Mr Mordekaivanour as a conscientious objector in prison. We must also put a stop to Nuclear Sharing, as laid down in articles 1 and 2 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which states that no State in possession of nuclear weapons can, directly or indirectly, transfer weapons to another country. On the contrary, we have seen that large quantities of nuclear weapons have been brought to NATO bases, against the wishes of the local population who have chosen to live in nuclear-free areas. The European Union is certainly active in consolidating the path to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. I do not want to lose confidence that it is possible to make this world more rational, and that it will stop producing what could destroy it. I am convinced that peace movements against nuclear weapons, which achieved so much in the seventies and eighties, could take up their activities again in cooperation with us and our Parliament, so that we can truly live in a nuclear-free world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My recollection is that he was a gunfighter. We are actually referring to Senator Jesse Helms who normally shoots from the hip, but not with a gun.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three points in this debate. Firstly, we all agree about stressing the dangers of nuclear proliferation. The Commission was right in its statement to highlight the need for a lead from the United States in dealing with countries like Russia, China, Pakistan and India, who are waiting for this lead. They do not have it now. We will have to try to do what we can to make sure the Senate recognises where reality is. Therefore we are right today to strongly criticise the action which the US Senate has taken on the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is interesting that in the previous debate we had on this issue of globalisation we recognised, whether we liked it or not, that economic forces were global, new technologies were global. And yet here we have a US Senate, a legislature, which wishes to resist the global environment in which it lives. Perhaps it is because they have fears of difficulties in verification and that the ban could allow countries such as North Korea and Iraq to conduct low-level tests, or perhaps they fear that by permanently halting testing the US could suffer a deterioration of its nuclear stock-pile and deterrent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner says there was an article in the <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span> from Sandy Berger, but was that the real answer to the question of why Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn the Treaty this time round? There is a second article in the <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span> today on exactly the same page where Mr Crystal, who is editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Standard</span>, says: “Republicans will argue that American security cannot be safeguarded by international conventions. Instead they will ask Americans to face this increasingly dangerous world without illusions. They will argue that American dominance can be sustained for many decades to come, not by arms control agreements but by augmenting America’s power and therefore its ability to lead.” I contend that we will have, as other speakers have said, the absolute right and need to argue with our Congressional colleagues, particularly those in the Senate. As a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States, I will be doing precisely that as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He called this irresponsible. This irresponsibility has dealt a severe blow to all international efforts towards non-proliferation and puts nuclear disarmament into a state of severe crisis. It seems that much more important to me at this time for the EU to take the initiative in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the initiative of President Jacques Chirac, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Prime Minister Tony Blair who, in an open letter to the American public, canvassed in favour of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That was not enough. We know that. Therefore, we must do a lot more. We must think in concrete terms and we must take action. I am a little disappointed, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have only told us what we have read in the newspapers anyway. I congratulate Commissioner Patten on the very concrete steps which he has presented here. Commissioner, I should like to urge you to collate these steps in a kind of action catalogue forming part of a report for the European Parliament. In that way, we can become active, take initiatives or make further proposals to the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">I should finally again like to support what the European Parliament decided on 18 November of last year when it supported the eight States’ declarations of 9 June 1998 concerning the new agenda coalition for the rapid, definitive and complete elimination of nuclear weapons.

They had acted to impede the Trident missile system based on the Clyde. Their aim was to prevent what they consider a grave crime under international law. The judge, Sheriff Gimblett directed the jury to acquit them on the ground that the prosecution had not proved they acted with any criminal intent. Her judgement can be appealed. If he appeals, the Lord Advocate of Scotland will have to contend in our highest appeal court for the lawfulness of a defence policy based on weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The doctrine of double-effect has no application to weapons which, in their intrinsic design are designed to cause mass destruction. The courage and judicial independence of Sheriff Gimblett – the courage of Angela Zetter and her companions stand in sharp contrast with the petulant failure of the United States Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Like most of my countrymen I am deeply hostile to the use of Scottish waters for Trident. I am proud to represent here a party, the Scottish National Party, which opposes this absolutely. I am glad that the entire Green EFA Group is in solidarity with us on this point.

<p class="contents">At a particularly eventful and critical time in the international arena, rejection by the one and only de facto superpower has raised a fundamental issue; that is, the need to reaffirm the political will of the civilised world to monitor effectively the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Without a doubt, modern democratic societies enjoy an order of peace, security, growth and prosperity. However, new forms of political and social instability can indeed threaten the cohesion of our liberal societies, for example as a result of organised terrorism. Terrorism today is regaining strength at all levels and is keeping up to date with new technological developments in both weaponry and communications systems. </p>
<p class="contents">According to available statistics, there may be, at some point in the future, means of mass destruction which will be used to hit specific political targets anywhere in the world. Such a prospect, Mr President, should remain just a prospect. Only by introducing concerted, joint preventative measures to monitor the development, availability and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction can we prevent this from happening. We are under no illusion that limiting nuclear weapons and banning their development will, undoubtedly, discourage some states from acquiring any in the future. We have all seen what has been happening between India and Pakistan. Very often, differences between warring neighbouring countries or even upsetting a geopolitical equilibrium which one state feels is not in its interest is reason enough for some to resort to the nuclear option. It is, however, important in all cases that there are clear and binding expressions of political will, both internationally and on the part of those who can guarantee world peace and stability, that the non-proliferation of nuclear arsenals is a high and non-negotiable priority. </p>
<p class="contents">We would like to believe, Mr President, that the decision by the American Senate is but a temporary diversion from the moral obligation which the superpower has towards public opinion worldwide, i.e. as a country which should lead the way in its policies to reduce nuclear danger.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very many states renounce nuclear weapons voluntarily. The major nuclear powers have scaled down their arsenals by a considerable amount, but that does not mean that we can rest content though. The START process is faltering and too many countries reserve the right to develop a nuclear capability.</p>
<p class="contents">This is increasing tension in some parts of the world. Some time ago a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed. An important step forwards. The treaty was and is the expression of an ambition to eradicate nuclear weapons in the long term. The US was one of the countries that promoted the ban and it is extremely sad that it is precisely the US, or rather the majority in the Senate, that have now declined to ratify the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Non-Proliferation Treaty more or less signifies the acceptance of five nuclear powers. The non-nuclear states went along with it on condition that the nuclear powers would do everything to reduce their nuclear capability. A ban on nuclear testing was and continues to be an essential part of this. This commitment is an important feature of the non-proliferation process and constitutes its moral basis to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">That is another reason why the step taken by the American Senate is so serious. The credibility of the non-proliferation process is thereby impaired. The Senate points to the fact that countries such as Iraq could pose a nuclear threat in the future. The US therefore claims that it must continue to be in a position to have an up to date nuclear arsenal at its disposal and that nuclear tests may be necessary to this end. </p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the significance of this line of argument in political and military terms, it is important to recognise that it is an expression of American provincialism which leaves no room for a reciprocal international approach, in which countries such as Iraq are countered with international embargoes coupled with sanctions. We believe that the EU will have to be quite forceful in fostering this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This behaviour by the US Senate is in conflict with the final declaration of the CTBT Conference which, as the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned, sat in Vienna from 6 to 8 October and emphasised the importance of a comprehensive, verifiable ban on nuclear testing, as well as urging all States to sign and ratify this Agreement quickly. </p>
<p class="contents">Viewed with political realism, the fact that this has not happened in the USA is not of very great importance because, of 155 countries, only 51 have so far ratified the Treaty and, of 44 key States, only 41 have signed it. However, this Treaty’s coming into force in the USA would have put regional nuclear powers under pressure to enter into the Treaty – countries such as India and Pakistan, which are in the process of building up their regional balance of terror, or North Korea or Iran, Iraq or Israel. Not all of these countries are equally unpredictable, but the proliferation of nuclear weapons has, unfortunately, not declined but increased since the existence of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Through the failure of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the United States, fresh impetus will be given to the suspicion on the part of Third World nuclear powers and countries on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers that the Non-Proliferation Treaty<span class="italic"> </span>primarily serves to maintain the large nations’ nuclear status and discriminates against small countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that a non-nuclear power like Austria has signed and ratified the Test Ban Treaty is no doubt laudable but will have no direct effects upon regional nuclear powers. What we want to see and must now strive that much more to achieve is a step-by-step approach to the final goal of nuclear disarmament. A ban on nuclear testing is part and parcel of this process, to the same extent as the continuation of the START process and the verifiable reduction in fissionable material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also mention the impact this has on the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is due to be reviewed next year because that is based on the premise that existing nuclear powers work towards disarmament. That premise must now be called into question. And all this despite the fact that the Test Ban Treaty would have frozen forever US nuclear superiority. That is the stupidity of this.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is actually about a broader issue. This is really about domestic US politics. If, for example, we look at the history of western policy towards former Yugoslavia, we see the effectiveness of that ebbed and flowed with the ebb and flow of US domestic politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Commissioner Patten, if he is still listening, whether or not he agrees with me that this reinforces the need for an effective European Foreign Security Policy and European Defence Policy where we would be capable of taking autonomous action – not to be independent, but rather to protect our security from being blown around constantly in the winds of US domestic policies and US presidential elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to nuclear weapons, there are two central treaties: on the one hand, the Non-Proliferation Treaty in which the nuclear powers have undertaken to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals in return for other countries’ not acquiring nuclear weapons; and, on the other hand, the Test Ban Treaty which is incredibly important because the purpose of the tests is to develop nuclear weapons. </p>
<p class="contents">It is an enormously dangerous signal which the American Senate has sent out to the world community. In this way, the process of nuclear disarmament, which is so extraordinarily important, may be brought to a standstill. Let me say that it is not the case that nuclear weapons are only dangerous when they are used; instead, their mere existence is a source of danger. </p>
<p class="contents">The four-star general, Lee Butler, who was responsible for American strategic nuclear weapons and who has had his finger on the button for many years, is entirely convinced that the very existence of nuclear weapons, which can be triggered not only through political decisions but also through technical mistakes, is a very serious matter. It is important that the European Union should clearly speak its mind to the United States and demand that the present Treaty in fact be ratified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also good that our Member States have comprehensively ratified the treaty. It is unfortunate that the American Senate has given the totally wrong signal in this issue, and especially the wrong signal to those countries that might still feel tempted to carry out nuclear testing. I assure you that, for our part, this issue will be raised continually in political dialogue between the European Union and the United States. But as you know, the US administration is not a problem here: we, and especially you, the Members of Parliament, must target your special efforts at the American Senate, for it to support this treaty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He and I have known one another for 35 years which may surprise honourable Members because we both look much younger than that. But I think that I can honestly say that our respective views on nuclear weapons have not changed in three and a half decades which is an argument, I guess, for consistency through life.</p>
<p class="contents">One rather more serious point. I think that most speakers have made the extremely important distinction between the United States and the United States Administration, on the one hand, and the United States Senate, and in particular its Republican majority, on the other, a point made by Mr Baron, Mr Haarder, Mr Elles and by other speakers. It is important for us to make that distinction and to recognise that it is the Senate and the Members of Congress as a whole on whom we need to put some pressure. One thing we have to argue with them, and it was reflected in the article from which the honourable Member, Mr Elles, quoted, is that unilateralism today as advocated by some Republicans, but not all Republicans to be fair to Senator Logan, is a policy, to borrow from Irish history of “ourselves alone” that would be as disastrous for the world as it was after the First World War.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, we have a lot of persuading to do. The honourable and gallant Member, General Morillon, mentioned the vote in the Senate and that it had been lost by 51 to 48. Actually, it is more serious than that because it requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to ratify a treaty, so we are still almost 20 votes short of that ratification figure. In any event, I can assure Parliament that the Commission will want to join honourable Members in trying to persuade Senators to think again. It is in our interest, it is in their interest and it is in the whole world’s interest.</p>

I totally agree with him on that issue. But perhaps I could go a stage further and say that what would be really damaging for the European Union would be if, having asserted the case for a common foreign and security policy, having argued the case for a European security and defence initiative, we were then to fall way short of our rhetoric in what we actually did. Because in those circumstances we would have had the worst possible effect on American public opinion as well as on our own. It would be the sort of action that would encourage the very unilateralist sentiments in the United States that he and I both deplore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
