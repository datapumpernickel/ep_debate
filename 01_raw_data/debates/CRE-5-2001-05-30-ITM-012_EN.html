<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hedkvist Petersen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, at this very late hour I, as rapporteur, would like to say a few words about the report. Firstly, I would like to thank all my colleagues for such excellent teamwork on the committee. I would also like to thank the Commission for an excellent proposal for a directive regarding safety belts and child restraint systems in vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important issue. I would like once again to repeat that a <span class="italic">very</span> large number of people die in road traffic accidents in EU Member States. We are talking about around 42,000 people a year. We would <span class="italic">never</span> accept such a high death rate in any other form of transport, so we must act. One such action is the proposal now being tabled by the Commission. We must also remember that children are at great risk on the roads. The most common cause of death among children and young people is traffic accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether the EU should legislate on safety belts and child safety in cars. My answer is yes. I think it is very important. Firstly, it has a legal basis in the Treaty of Rome. Secondly there is already legislation, a directive, which must now be strengthened, due to a need for such action.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that safety belts save lives. This is particularly the case regarding children. Accident research shows that the risk of serious injury is seven times higher for children who do not use a restraint system than for children who do use such a system. There is therefore a need for such a system.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, traffic in Europe today is, to a very large extent, transboundary. People travel in private cars, but also in commercial vehicles. Private and commercial motoring is increasing across borders, as we have seen in a report today. We also have rapidly increasing numbers of tourists, which creates a need for common regulations with regard to fundamental safety measures on our roads. It is therefore important that we have a high level of safety in all EU countries, so that we know what regulations apply to private drivers or occupational drivers, and also to car manufacturers. It is important for them to have common safety requirements so that the regulations are clear. At the same time, it is also important to consumers that safety systems become cheaper, which will be the case if the regulations are common throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is a strengthening of a previous directive, which states that all passengers in a vehicle equipped with safety belts must use them, that all children must, without exception, be restrained in approved child car seats, that children under three may not travel in cars without suitable child car seats, with the exception of taxis, and that the use of rear-facing child car seats is forbidden if the air bag has not been de-activated.</p>
<p class="contents">All these are good proposals. The committee agrees that these should also be put forward as Parliament’s proposals. However, we propose six amendments. Briefly, the first amendment is that the Commission, along with the Member States and road safety organisations, should promote an information campaign. Our second amendment is that the height of the child should determine when a child can use an adult seat belt. In Amendment 4, we want manufacturers to state which child car seats fit which car models. We also propose that rural buses used in city traffic – not particularly common, but it happens – should not be covered by the requirement for compulsory use. We also want the Commission, in partnership with the automotive industry, to develop safer and more user-friendly systems for air bags. In addition, a report on this should be incorporated into the report to be presented no later than 1 August 2004 on the implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will discuss the Commission’s proposals at the Transport Council at the end of June. I look forward to our being able to reach a common decision in the EU and to our being able to implement this vital measure which is fundamental to road safety in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As MEPs we therefore have a great responsibility to work for greater safety on the roads. We also know, however, that traffic is increasing from year to year and one of the consequences of this is that it becomes a greater source of danger. In my opinion, the question of the compulsory wearing of safety belts has a crucial part to play.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I am very much in agreement with the Commission’s proposal for improving the safety of drivers and passengers. I also agree in principle that it should be compulsory for safety belts to be fastened at all times in all seats that are fitted with them or with the basic requirement that seats fitted with safety belts or child restraint systems should be used. I also see it as a fundamental obligation that restraint systems should be used for children under 12.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to note, however, that Member States need to be given some leeway for the national transposition of the directive on certain points. I am thinking of the use of restraint systems for very small children. I am also thinking of medical reasons and of quite specific situations such as the requirements for minibuses and coaches which the rapporteur has also mentioned. More details would be taking us too far here. Harmonisation of legislation at European level will make for transparency and clarity and improve the various national regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on this report, which I think is also a very balanced one, and I can already assure you today that my group will agree to this report. I should like to point out, however, that the detailed transposition of the directive must now be undertaken by the Member States and in the end it is the Member States who are responsible for safety on Europe’s roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tremendous progress has been made in road traffic safety. I come from part of a country where there were no child seats or child restraint systems at all ten years ago and retractable seat belts were a luxury. Then in 1991 I had the opportunity of being involved with devising the compulsory seat belt directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are already talking about the need to adapt that directive to scientific and technical progress. The wide-ranging findings of accident research and the modern safety restraint systems developed by the industry make the present-day situation unacceptable. It is irresponsible to allow children under three years of age to be carried on the back seats of cars without anything to hold them or in child seats on the passenger seat without switching off the airbag. It must no longer be permissible for larger children to be secured using the belt intended for adults. Exceptions from the general compulsory safety belt rule for lorry drivers, for example, must in future also be things of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal embodied in six amendments tabled by the European Parliament to amend the directive in question will, among other things, make for technically safer solutions and above all ones that are easier for the consumer to use. The latter point in particular makes it more likely that the restraint systems fitted will actually be used. More than 50% of children still travel without using a seat belt, even where restraints are present in the vehicle. Parents seem to be unaware that the risk of their children suffering a serious or even fatal injury as a result of an accident is seven times greater if they are not wearing a seat belt.</p>
<p class="contents">Development work is continuing. Present-day child restraint systems are evaluated on the basis of frontal crash test results and almost always get good marks. However, 70% of all fatal accidents involving children in cars are the result of side crashes. That is where these systems fail. I recommend acceptance of the amendments before us today for adapting the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It demonstrates her personal sensitivity, and that of the whole committee, to an issue as important as road safety, in an attempt to reduce this unacceptable figure of 42 000 deaths per year, which is the number of people killed as a result of traffic accidents in the European Union. As she says in her report, this figure is too high.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal making the use of safety belts provided for that purpose compulsory for all road-vehicle users and, in the case of small children, child restraint systems in cars. I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that if you visit any retailer you will see that practically all child restraint systems currently on the market already comply with the legislation in force. The proposed directive therefore eliminates the exceptions which appeared in the original directive, since they were conceived of in different circumstances and allowed the use of adult safety belts in the absence of a child restraint system. We now believe that to be unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive, as well as protecting children in cars, will help to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries resulting from accidents in coaches, minibuses and lorries, by making the use of safety belts compulsory for drivers and passengers when those safety belts are supplied. The correct use of safety belts and child restraint systems is one of the most important measures being proposed by the Commission in the field of road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Both you in Parliament and the Council have supported this proposal by firmly backing the Commission’s working programme on road safety priorities in the Union, which include reporting on, detailing and classifying the measures to be adopted, making the use of safety belts and child restraint systems one of the fundamental priorities for road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will now refer to specific amendments. Only one, Amendment No 4, is unacceptable to the Commission. Our reason for not accepting it is that it would require manufacturers of vehicles to indicate which child restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles and can be easily installed in them. While the Commission acknowledges that there have been problems with installing some systems in certain vehicles, the fact is that the amendment would breach the rules on the internal market and establishment as well as the directive proposed in the latest international standard on child restraint systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, non-legislative measures are being adopted, particularly by means of the Euro-NCAP programme, with which, as you know, car manufactures are associated, to persuade those manufacturers to indicate which restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles. I imagine that this initiative will reduce the problem, together with the fact that the restraint systems governed by Regulation 44/03 are easier to install and safer than the systems previously available.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there are two amendments which would force the Commission to adopt measures which it has already planned to take. One is Amendment No 1, which would oblige the Commission to launch an awareness-raising campaign in parallel with the implementation of the directive. Amendment No 6(2), according to which the Commission should, in conjunction with the car industry, study the possibilities of using more user-friendly airbags, especially where rear-facing restraint systems are being used. The Commission would suggest that these two amendments do not appear in the legislative text, but that they be included in the preamble, since we accept that they are of interest and importance for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have summed up the Commission’s position in relation to the report. I repeat that, with the exception of Amendment No 4, which we must reject, we accept all the others, bearing in mind the comments I have made on Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 6(2), which instead of appearing in the legislative articles, would simply appear in the preamble to the final text.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much. It only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, once again, and also Mrs Schierhuber, for her speech, and to express my agreement with her. We will now have to see how the different Member States apply the legislation we are approving here. Precisely for this reason, and not only on this specific issue, but taking account of all the requirements of road safety, we are going to make a proposal on which we are working with Commissioner Vitorino to try to harmonise the effective application by the different Member States of the controls and also the penalties in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
