<p>(FR) Whilst the primary responsibility for the content of teaching – and hence for the choice of languages taught and the level at which they are taught – lies with the Member States alone, it should be pointed out that the Council has always supported initiatives and measures aimed at promoting language learning and linguistic diversity. These initiatives and measures include the transversal sub-programme of the Lifelong Learning Programme established by Decision No 1720/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>; the 2006 recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, from which communication in foreign languages in particular stands out; the conclusions on multilingualism that the Council adopted in May 2008<a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>; and the Council resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism<a href="#defann_1_4" name="refann_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the fact that, under Article 15(5) of the aforementioned Lifelong Learning Programme, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions an interim evaluation report on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the implementation of the Programme, including an analysis of the results achieved, by 31 March 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) In its six-month programme the Belgian Presidency stated its intention to highlight, within the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the potential of cultural and creative industries and the contribution they make to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), growth and employment in Europe. On 18 November the Council adopted its Work Plan for Culture, which defines the priorities in this area for the next four years, the cultural and creative industries being among the main priorities. Furthermore, in October the Presidency held an informal meeting of the Ministers of Culture on the topic of the cultural and creative industries. During that meeting, the Ministers emphasised that the strategies and measures to be developed for these industries at EU level should take into account small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), since they account for the majority of the businesses in the sector. On 26 November the Council adopted conclusions on the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative: Innovation Union. The conclusions recognise that the cultural and creative sectors represent an important source of technological and non-technological innovation, and that this potential must be fully unlocked.</p>
<p>Although the Council has not compiled its own statistics on the matter, according to the Green Paper ‘Unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries’<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, recent studies on the cultural and creative industries confirm that these industries employ around 5 million people across the EU and that they contribute an estimated 2.6% to EU GDP. Beyond their direct contribution to GDP, the cultural and creative industries are also important drivers in many other economic sectors. More detailed and harmonised statistics are currently being compiled by Eurostat, via the ‘ESSnet-culture’ project, with a view to more accurately assessing the economic importance of the cultural and creative industries. The results of the ‘ESSnet-culture’ project should be published by the end of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) After three years of negotiations on the Bali Action Plan, the Cancun Climate Change Conference represented a significant step towards a new international climate agreement.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Cancun Conference succeeded in taking decisions which, firstly, allow for immediate action on the ground and, secondly, lay the foundations for a post-2012 international agreement that is firmly based on the objective of keeping the increase in world temperature below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>As regards areas of immediate action, one can mention adaptation to climate change, technology, the fight against deforestation, and financing.</p>
<p>The Cancun Adaptation Framework has been adopted and an Adaptation Committee set up to strengthen consistent action on adapting to climate change that is aimed at mitigating the effects of changes that have already occurred. This new body should help to support those countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>A new technology facility has also been established with the aim of supporting actions to mitigate (reduction of greenhouse gases) and adapt to climate change. In order to facilitate the implementation of actions in this area, two new bodies have been created: the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network. These new bodies are expected to continue to promote in a more effective way research and technology deployment, dissemination and transfer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a system has been put in place to combat deforestation. Financial incentive measures will have to be developed on the basis of developing countries’ national strategies or action plans.</p>
<p>Lastly, a Green Climate Fund has been established to help meet the objective of providing the USD 100 billion pledged to developing countries by 2020.</p>
<p>However, Cancun is just the beginning. The Cancun texts lay the foundations for a future post-2012 international agreement. They strengthen the system of transparency for developed countries and establish the principles of such a system for developing countries. The big debate that will continue into next year concerns the legal form: the question is whether it will be possible to convince all the developed countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol to agree to a second commitment period, and whether the United States and the large emerging countries will agree to a new legal instrument under the convention.</p>
<p>Throughout next year the Council will begin the task of implementing the results and will focus on turning this process into a binding international framework that could be negotiated in Durban, South Africa. Above all, it will be necessary to ensure that the efforts made by the various parties really are in line with the 2°C target.</p>
<p>The European Parliament will be regularly informed of the progress of the negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0578"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) On 3 June 2003 the Council adopted conclusions on combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental health. In those conclusions, the Council invited the Member States to give specific attention to the impact of stigma and discrimination-related problems due to mental illness in all age groups, and ensure that these problems are recognised, as well as to undertake action to combat stigma and promote social inclusion in active partnership and dialogue with all the stakeholders. It also invited the Commission to give specific attention to active collaboration in all relevant Community policies and actions, and in particular in activities relating to employment, non-discrimination, social protection, education and health, in order to reduce stigma and discrimination in relation to mental illness.</p>
<p>Since the most common type of dementia within the European Union is Alzheimer’s disease (70% of cases), on 26 September 2008 the Council adopted conclusions on a common commitment by the Member States to combat neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>The EU High-Level Conference entitled ‘Together for Mental Health and Well-being’ was held in Brussels on 13 June 2008. During that conference, the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being was launched. The result was the creation of an EU framework for cooperation on mental health in the context of which actions are undertaken in five priority areas. Two thematic conferences on these areas were held during 2010 – ‘Promotion of Mental Health and Well-being in Older People’ (Madrid, 28-29 June 2010) and ‘Combating Stigma and Promoting Social Inclusion’ (Lisbon, 8-9 November 2010) – with the Commission and the Member States acting as co-sponsors.</p>
<p>Only a short while ago, the Belgian Presidency organised, in relation to the priority area of the mental health of older people, a high-level conference on dementia, which was held in Brussels on 25-26 November 2010.

<p>It is well known that the European merchant navy has contributed substantially to Europe's economic recovery. However, the EU faces many challenges if its fleet is to be competitive. One of these – perhaps the greatest – is how to attract suitable recruits. If a high level of technical expertise is to be achieved, an articulated policy is needed to attract young people to the merchant navy and keep them in the profession. A high-quality merchant navy is not merely the objective; it is the precondition for a competitive European fleet. However, the growing shortage of European seamen and the reduction in technical naval expertise pose a very real threat to this sector and the maritime profession.</p>

<p>(FR) With regard to the more general issue of equal treatment of persons with disabilities, in June 2010 the Council adopted a resolution on a new European Disability Framework<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in which it concludes, inter alia, that access to employment, goods and services, and education, and to social and public life, among other spheres, is a prerequisite for the full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in society<a href="#defann_6_2" name="refann_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In this regard, the Council is currently examining a proposal for a Council directive, tabled by the Commission, on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, with the aim of guaranteeing equal treatment in areas other than employment, including in access to goods and services.</p>
<p>More specifically, with regard to the issue of works being accessible to visually impaired people, it should be pointed out that, on 14 September 2010, the Commission signed the ‘EU Stakeholders Dialogue Memorandum of Understanding on access to works by people with print disabilities’. The Council will certainly examine any potential proposal from the Commission in this area.</p>
<p>At international level, the European Union and its Member States have proposed a ‘Draft Joint Recommendation Concerning the Improved Access to Works Protected by Copyright for Persons with a Print Disability’ to the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).

<p>Council Answer</p>
<p>15.12.2010</p>
<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The European Union attaches great importance to maintaining close and productive relations with Russia, one of its strategic partners. These relations cover a very wide range of areas, such as economic relations, issues relating to justice, freedom and security, external security, research, education and culture. All these areas are covered, firstly, by the road maps for the four Common Spaces, adopted in spring 2005, and secondly, of course, by the negotiations on the new EU-Russia agreement, which have just begun their 13th round. The agreement reached between Russia and the EU on 24 November on the bilateral issues that are still outstanding, in relation to Russia’s accession to the WTO, should greatly facilitate the ongoing talks.</p>
<p>At the Rostov Summit, held on 31 May and 1 June 2010, the EU and Russia launched the Partnership for Modernisation, to give fresh political impetus to the implementation of the four road maps and to help resolve any outstanding issues in EU-Russia relations. A joint statement adopted at the summit gives a broad outline of the proceedings. The aim of the Partnership is to establish a flexible framework in order to promote reform, sustain growth and enhance competitiveness, based on the four spaces, also by complementing the partnerships for modernisation which have been developed bilaterally between a number of Member States and Russia, albeit without superseding the ongoing negotiations for a new EU-Russia agreement.</p>
<p>The aim of the Partnership for Modernisation is not only to promote trade and investment, but also and above all – based on a very broad definition of the word ‘modernisation’ – to promote democracy and the rule of law, without which there can be no real modernisation of society. Thus, the joint statement focuses on areas such as the efficient administration of justice, strengthening the fight against corruption and improving dialogue with civil society. A work plan has been developed by the Russian coordinators and the Commission and was presented at the EU-Russia summit in Brussels on 7 December 2010. This work plan is a flexible instrument which should be regularly updated.</p>
<p>Other projects aiming to strengthen our relations are also under way, in particular the discussions concerning the long-term liberalisation of the visa regime between the EU and Russia. At the Permanent Partnership Council on Freedom, Security and Justice, held on 19 November 2010, our ministers agreed on a ‘common steps’ approach, following which a possible abolition of the visa regime could be negotiated. This approach was confirmed at the highest level by both parties at the last EU-Russia summit in Brussels.</p>
<p>Finally, cooperation in crisis management is also very good and has been successful in Chad and off the Somali coast. Our experts are currently examining ways of formalising such cooperation based on already existing arrangements, while, naturally, respecting the EU’s decision-making autonomy.</p>
<p>All these measures are in addition to the intense political and technical dialogue that is taking place between the EU and Russia, including at the highest level, and which is enabling us to work tirelessly towards approximating our positions on the entire range of areas covered by the existing EU-Russia agreement and the four Common Spaces.</p>
<p>The Council has also begun a debate on relations with strategic partners, particularly in the context of the establishment of the European External Action Service, and Russia is, of course, one of the main countries to which the Heads of State or Government are currently turning their attention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0596"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Despite repeated calls from the Council, and as is emphasised in particular in the Declaration of the European Community and its Member States of 21 September 2005 and in Council conclusions, specifically those of December 2006 and December 2009, Turkey continues to refuse to fulfil its obligation of full, non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement and has not removed all obstacles to the free movement of goods, including restrictions on direct transport links with Cyprus.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Turkey has not made progress towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus. It has continued to impose its veto on Cyprus’ membership of certain international organisations, including the OECD, as well as its participation in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies.</p>
<p>The EU’s position on this subject is clear and has not changed: the full, non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement is a contractual obligation that Turkey must fulfil. This message has been clearly addressed to Turkey in the December 2010 Council conclusions on enlargement. The Council conclusions clearly state that, in the absence of progress on this issue, the Council will maintain its measures from 2006, which will have a continuous effect on the overall progress of our negotiations with Turkey. Progress is now expected without further delay.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely monitor this issue, as well as other aspects linked to the reform measures to be taken by Turkey, and to raise them at all levels, as appropriate, since the implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement and the normalisation of relations with the Republic of Cyprus are requirements against which Turkey’s progress in the negotiations is measured.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0598"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The target of lifting at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020 was approved by the June 2010 European Council as part of the Europe 2020 strategy objective of promoting social inclusion<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This target should be measured on the basis of three indicators reflecting different dimensions of poverty and exclusion: the at-risk-of poverty rate, the material deprivation rate and the share of people living in jobless households.</p>
<p>The Europe 2020 strategy also contains seven flagship initiatives, including the European Platform against Poverty to ensure social and territorial cohesion such that the benefits of growth and jobs are widely shared and people experiencing poverty and social exclusion are enabled to live in dignity and take an active part in society. This platform will be presented by the European Commission by the end of December 2010.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2010 the Council adopted, in the framework of the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, a decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, including Guideline 10 specifically relating to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. Since the Europe 2020 strategy emphasises, in particular, the principle of access for all to high quality, affordable and sustainable services, on 7 December 2010 the Council also adopted conclusions on Social Services of General Interest<a href="#defann_11_3" name="refann_11_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. </p>
<p>On 6 December the Council adopted the ‘Declaration on The European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion: Working together to fight poverty in 2010 and beyond’<a href="#defann_11_4" name="refann_11_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, to ensure that the achievements of that European Year continue. To lend still more weight to these achievements, the relevant ministers of the Member States are requested to sign the declaration at the Closing Conference of the European Year, which will be held in Brussels on 16 and 17 December 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Council Answer</p>
<p>15.12.2010</p>
<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Council is deeply concerned by the violence that is raging in Iraq, notably against persons belonging to minorities, and is paying close attention to the development of the situation in the country. The attack on the congregation inside Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad, in which many innocent civilians were wounded or killed, was a real tragedy. The High Representative, Baroness Ashton, immediately condemned that intolerable attack against innocent believers.</p>
<p>The EU is deeply concerned and condemns all forms of intolerance and violence against persons because of their religion or belief, no matter where they are committed. In many countries, the fundamental rights of persons belonging to religious minorities are still not respected. The EU is absolutely determined to combat discrimination based on religion or belief, as confirmed in the November 2009 Council conclusions, in which the EU ministers decided to strengthen the EU’s efforts to promote freedom of religion or belief in bilateral relations and in a multilateral context.</p>
<p>The Council addressed the issue of violence against religious minorities in general and in Iraq in particular during its November meeting and adopted conclusions on that country. It expressed its deep concern and outright condemnation of the recent attacks in Iraq against Christian and Muslim believers. It condemned all incitement to and acts of violence, including those motivated by religious and ethnic hatred.</p>
<p>On that occasion, the Council also underlined the urgent need for a stable and representative Iraqi Government, which is able to rededicate itself to the pursuit of national reconciliation. It welcomed the first steps towards the formation of an inclusive new Government in Iraq. This new government will have to tackle continuing violence in Iraq, as well as many other major challenges. The Council will continue, of course, to put forward its point of view, and it looks forward to engaging with the new Iraqi Government, notably on issues relating to human rights.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to raise the issue of human rights, including the protection of persons belonging to minorities, whenever the opportunity arises and at all levels, and to stress the importance of honouring all the commitments made at international level, in particular those which the Iraqi Government made in Geneva in 2010 on the occasion of the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review.</p>
<p>The EU is preparing to sign a partnership and cooperation agreement with Iraq. The Council hopes that a new government will soon be in place in that country, so that the process of strengthening our relations can continue. The EU continues to provide development aid to Iraq, with said aid including an important section on the rule of law, and the Council recently extended until June 2012 the ‘Rule of Law’ mission EUJUST LEX, which includes a training programme in Iraq.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Government has indicated that it intends to fulfil its international obligations in the area of human rights; minorities will be protected by the Iraqi Constitution. We will continue to cooperate constructively with Iraq in order to support the efforts that the country is making in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0611"></a>

<p>Council Answer</p>
<p>15.12.2010</p>
<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the December 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) At the OSCE summit held in Astana on 1 and 2 December 2010, the members of the Organisation adopted a commemorative declaration. That declaration contains a full and unequivocal reaffirmation of all the principles, norms and commitments made by the participating States of the OSCE within the framework of that organisation, starting with the Helsinki Final Act. Furthermore, the commemorative declaration contains a commitment by the participating States that they will enhance the OSCE and work towards strengthening its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it was not possible to adopt an action plan for the OSCE during the Astana summit; this was and still is a priority for the European Union. However, thanks to the EU’s efforts, the commemorative declaration tasks the future Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE (Lithuania) with organising a follow-up process with a view to developing a concrete action plan for the Organisation, with the support of all its bodies and of the participating States.</p>
<p>Lastly, EU coordination on the eve of and during the summit was excellent. As a result, the EU was able to play a central and constructive role. The President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, also gave a speech on behalf of the EU, in which he outlined its vision of the future of the OSCE and reaffirmed its support for the Organisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0613"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Year of Volunteering (EYV) will be presented at the European Union, national and regional level with the full involvement of civil society organisations. The activities range from conferences, debates, exchange of good practices, from the EYV Tour to showcase volunteering in all the Member States to media events across the EU.</p>
<p>Volunteering provides a valuable contribution to European integration. 2011 will be the year for awareness-raising with four main objectives:</p>
<p>The first is to reduce barriers to volunteering, which in many cases will require legislative and administrative action at the national level. The EY will provide input for policy development to make this happen, by initiating a dialogue within Member States and between the Member States and the volunteering organisations.</p>
<p>The second objective is to empower volunteering organisations and improve the quality of volunteering, e.g. through exchanges of best practice. The recent Call for Proposals<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for Flagship Projects is one tangible step that the Commission has taken to address this objective.</p>
<p>The third objective is to reward and recognise volunteering activities. There are two angles to 'recognition': one is about the measurement of the contribution of the volunteering sector to the economy and society, i.e. improving the availability of internationally-comparable statistics in volunteering. The second angle concerns the validation or recognition of skills and competences that an individual can gain through volunteering.</p>
<p>The fourth objective is to ensure that there is increased awareness both within Europe and abroad of the value of volunteering and its contribution to the economy, society and individual's lives.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that there is strong commitment to ensure that the Year has a meaningful, lasting and positive legacy for volunteering beyond the end of 2011. The Commission will draw upon the results of the various conferences and events during the Year that will serve as platform for broadening and deepening the outreach, content and quality of volunteering. We do not yet know the precise nature of the political outcomes of the Year — we'll find out more during the Year itself. However, under Article 11 of the Council Decision that set up the Year (Council Decision 2010/37/EC of 27 November 2009<a href="#defann_15_2" name="refann_15_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), the Commission is obliged to write a Report to the other EU institutions (Parliament, Committee of the Regions, European Economic and Social Committee, Council) after the Year has ended.

<p>On 11 March 2004 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the accession to the European Union of 10 States, including Latvia and Estonia ((<a href="/doceo/document/TA-5-2004-0180_EN.html">P5_TA(2004)0180</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/A-5-2004-0111_EN.html">A5-0111/2004</a>).

<p>I can inform you that, while Estonia acted on the resolution, Latvia completely ignored it. At present 335 000 non-citizens in Latvia, making up 15% of the population, the majority of whom were born in Latvia and have lived there all their lives, are deprived of their basic rights: non-citizens of Latvia are not allowed to vote, or to stand as candidates, in local elections. To what extent does a situation in which 15% of a country’s population do not have the right to vote accord with European law?

<p>The Commission is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the EU Drugs Action Plans. It published the first assessment of the implementation of the EU Drugs Action Plan (2009-2012) on 5 November 2010. This assessment<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has been sent to the Parliament and Council.</p>
<p>The assessment shows that progress was made on the majority of actions under the Drugs Action Plan. Notable achievements include:</p>
<p>– a decline in the number of new HIV cases among drug users;</p>
<p>– increased cooperation to combat drug trafficking; and,</p>
<p>– a more strategic approach to drug-related research.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, such as:</p>
<p>– the increase in the number of deaths caused by cocaine overdoses;</p>
<p>– the rapid emergence of new psychoactive substances, which are marketed as legal alternatives to illicit drugs ("legal highs") and which can pose health and social risks;</p>
<p>– the increase in the combined use of licit and illicit drugs (poly-drug use);</p>
<p>– the swift change in drug trafficking routes, as organised crime groups seek to circumvent the barriers set up by EU Member States to disrupt their trade; and</p>
<p>– the need to increase focus on policies to reduce the demand for drugs in third countries with regards to external assistance.</p>
<p>Next year, the Commission will launch a wide-ranging independent evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 and its two implementing Action Plans. This will be the most comprehensive assessment of EU drugs policy to date, taking stock of eight years of drugs policy in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The current presidential election campaign in Belarus is a little more transparent and democratic than the previous one, although it still falls far short of EU standards. The EU has promised the Belarusian authorities some EUR 3 billion in loans and aid if the elections are democratic. The Belarusian economy may face serious short-term problems. In response to the challenges presented by the economic crisis, various EU Member States, including Lithuania, have decided to launch a number of joint projects with Belarus and Ukraine in the fields of energy, transport and culture, which they intend to implement with support from the EU. Agreements between Belarus and Poland, Lithuania and Latvia should soon enter into force, making it easier for border residents to cross the border. Negotiations may start early next year between the EU and Belarus on lower visa fees and re-entry.</p>

<p>(EN) Since the release of the political prisoners in 2008 in Belarus, the EU has developed a policy of gradual and critical engagement with the country. This policy has permitted the resumption of high level meetings, the expansion of sectoral dialogues and the participation of Belarus in the Eastern Partnership (EaP). In addition, the EU is currently working on a draft Joint Interim Plan for reforms (to be negotiated and implemented by Belarus) and is discussing negotiating mandates for visa facilitation and readmission agreements that will strengthen contacts between people.</p>
<p>We understand that Belarus, together with other EaP partners and some Member States, intends to put forward revised proposals for joint projects to be supported under the EaP. Once they have been received, we will look into them carefully and assess whether they can benefit from EaP support.</p>
<p>Support of individual EU Member States, including the country’s neighbours, to Belarus is welcome, if it is provided in conformity with the EU approach towards Belarus, as agreed by the Council. In addition, local border traffic agreements between Belarus and the three neighbouring Member States are being finalized. The Commission welcomes the signing of such agreements which will strengthen contacts between the people across the borders.</p>
<p>The Commission learnt with interest the recent reported statements according to which Belarus might count on more than EUR 3 billion support in the next three years, if it holds free and fair elections and improves relations with the EU. While the Commission is not in a position to give a figure, a further increase in EU assistance would be in line with the approach set out by the Foreign Affairs Council in its conclusions on Belarus of 25 October 2010.</p>
<p>On elections, we share the view that some progress have been observed compared to past elections. In line with the OSCE-ODIHR recommendations, the Commission has conveyed to Belarus the EU’s requests regarding the conduct of the elections. We will be watching the conduct of the upcoming elections closely. Clear and measurable progress in the conduct of the elections compared to past elections would give new impetus to take the EU's engagement policy towards Belarus further.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0586"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully supports the on-going efforts at reaching a settlement of the Cyprus problem, which would be to the benefit of Cyprus and the EU in general. In addition, the Commission expects Turkey to fully implement the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement.</p>
<p>The Commissioner responsible for Enlargement is in regular contact with all stakeholders, and closely monitors the developments as regards the Cyprus issue.</p>
<p>Dialogue with all stakeholders takes place within the parameters of the Council's declaration of 21 September 2005 and its conclusions of 11 December 2006.</p>
<p>As regards the second issue raised in the question, the Commission takes good note of the opinion of the JURI committee referred to in the question. Nonetheless, in the Commission's view, Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is the right legal basis for the so called Direct Trade Regulation.</p>
<p>When proposing the direct trade rules with the northern part of Cyprus, the Commission used the legal basis which corresponds to the content of the measures. The purpose of the proposal of the Commission is to provide for a classical trade concession regime, not to lift the suspension and apply part of the acquis in the northern part of Cyprus. The extension of the acquis is only possible after a settlement and reunification of the country. For obvious reasons, the acquis is not enforceable in those areas before reunification.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposed the adoption of this act on the basis of Article 133 of the EC Treaty (now 207 TFEU) which is the relevant legal basis for such trade regimes.</p>
<p>The fact that the areas in question are part of a Member State (Cyprus) does not make this legal basis inappropriate. These areas are outside the customs and fiscal territory of the EU, which is a consequence of the suspension of the acquis there.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal has nothing to do with the status of the 'Green Line' in Cyprus and is in no way tantamount to considering it as an external EU border.</p>
<p>The Commission stands by its proposal and understands the opinion of the Parliament's Committee on legal Affairs to be an intermediate step in the ongoing parliamentary procedure. The Commission will formally react upon adoption by the Parliament of its position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0591"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the importance of the problem posed by school drop-outs, especially in the case of girls in the East and Southeast of Turkey, and it is closely monitoring the efforts made by Turkey to address this issue. While the number of early school leavers remains considerable, Turkey displays a positive trend in this area.</p>
<p>As presented by the Commission in its 2010 Progress Report on Turkey, the share of population aged 18-24 with at most lower secondary education and not in further training decreased steadily from 58.1% in 2000 to 44.6% in 2010. School enrollment rate in Turkey in primary education increased significantly as a result of the 1997 Basic Education Law. Across Turkey, net primary school enrolment rate (grades 1-8) rose to 98.47% for boys and 97.84% for girls during the 2009-10 educational year. These figures also indicate that the gender gap in primary education has virtually closed at national level. In secondary education (grades 9-12), the net enrolment rate rose to 64.95% in the 2009-10 school year. However, there are huge geographic variations: enrolment rates in individual provinces range from 27% to 89%, with Eastern provinces coming out worst, as enrolment to secondary education is not compulsory in Turkey. There is also a significant gender imbalance, net enrolment rates being 67.55% among boys and 62.21% among girls.</p>
<p>The Commission supports Turkey's efforts to increase the enrolment of children in primary and secondary education under the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). In this respect, let me mention two projects which were recently approved by the Commission:</p>
<p>The first project is entitled "Increasing Primary School Attendance Rate of Children in Turkey" and seeks to decrease the incidence of drop-outs, especially in the South-East of Turkey. The total EU contribution for this project EUR 2.88 million. Implementation of the project is expected to start in late 2011.</p>
<p>The second project is entitled "Increasing Enrollment Rates Especially for Girls in Secondary Education". The total EU contribution for this project EUR 16 million. By increasing the enrolment rates for girls in secondary education, the Commission also aims to facilitate women's access to labor market. The implementation of this project is expected to start in 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0606"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission's first progress report on Iceland has been sent to the Parliament on 9 November 2010 and was discussed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) the same day.</p>
<p>Progress was made on the political criteria as Iceland has taken steps to address the shortcomings identified in the Opinion on the appointment of judges and conflict of interest. The report assessed the follow up to the conclusions of the Special Investigation Committee positively. The Commission now needs to closely monitor the effect of these measures on the ground.</p>
<p>On the economic criteria, the picture is a mixed one: while the economy has been stabilising, ensuring the proper functioning of the financial sector and reducing debt levels are still a challenge.</p>
<p>Finally, the report confirms the assessment of the Opinion as regards the main challenges of the accession negotiations: fisheries, environment, agriculture and reform of the financial sector.</p>
<p>As for the accession negotiations, we are still at a relatively early stage. Presently the Commission services are in the midst of the so-called 'screening exercise' – the analytical examination of the acquis - which started on 15 November 2010 and will continue until mid-June 2011.</p>
<p>The Commission services have started with the more complex chapters e.g. financial services, environment, agriculture, fisheries (on the screening agenda for 16 and 17 December 2010) in parallel with less complex chapters, especially those covered by the European Economic Area (EEA). The Commission's first impression after some four weeks of screening meetings with experts from Iceland is that the Icelandic authorities are preparing well for the exercise and are fully aware of the tasks involved.</p>
<p>'Negotiations proper' have not yet started – the Commission is presently in the process of evaluating the degree of preparedness of Iceland and identifying any potential shortcomings in implementing the acquis that may need to be dealt with in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p>In view of the information obtained during screening meetings, the Commission will assess where negotiations can proceed and propose accordingly to the Member States. The Commission hopes that it will be possible to open accession negotiations in a couple of policy areas by mid-2011.</p>
<p>Overall, Iceland is well prepared to take on the obligations of membership in the medium term, particularly in the fields covered by the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Schengen area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0575"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to note that the choice to use public resources to support financial institutions is made by Member States based on their own policies and on the decisions made by their own government bodies. The Commission oversees closely such allocation when it is regarded as State aid, based on the need to maintain fairness in the different markets across the European Union. The Commission would like to stress that limiting the distortions of competition caused by the considerable amounts of aid provided to the financial sector in the EU is a priority for the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has approved the schemes the honourable Member has mentioned in his question on the basis of Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This legal basis allows the Commission to find compatible with the TFEU aid that has been granted to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State. When assessing whether aid measures could be found compatible on this basis, the Commission also has to verify whether the aid is appropriate, necessary and proportionate. In that context the Commission can take into account the amount of aid provided through a scheme.</p>
<p>The Commission would furthermore like to point out that most schemes contain conditions which ensure that a bank that uses the scheme is subject to restructuring. During its assessment of the restructuring plan, the Commission focusses on the criteria specified in the Commission Communication on the return to viablity and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Communication"). The restructuring plan therefore has to show: (1) how the bank in questions returns to viability, (2) that sufficient burden-sharing is achieved and (3) that the distortions of competition caused by the aid are remedied.</p>
<p>The Commission has assessed a large number of different schemes and individual measures before Member States implemented them. These measures are intended to address different problems that financial institutions may suffer. The Commission does not favour any particular type of measure, on the conditions that they can be found compatible with the internal market and they comply with the guidance provided by the Commission in the field of State aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0582"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU-wide stress tests coordinated by CEBS in July 2010 focused mainly on credit and market risks and contained adverse scenarios that were extreme but plausible at the time they were made.</p>
<p>In Ireland the economic situation changed rapidly, and adverse risks have materialised. While the tested banks satisfied the agreed benchmark for the exercise (albeit not by a large margin), the deteriorating situation after the EU stress test increased market expectations regarding capital ratios.</p>
<p>The PCAR exercise carried out by the Irish authorities addressed those market expectations by applying higher capital target levels than those agreed in the EU wide stress test. The EU wide stress test did not apply an individual target capital level for each Member State since the outcome of the test would not have been comparable. Instead, it was agreed to apply a prudent regulatory benchmark that was significantly above the minimum solvency ratio. Nevertheless, it is both legitimate and appropriate that the Irish authorities decided to be more ambitious and raise the capital levels of the Irish banking system above the agreed levels in order to reassure the markets.</p>
<p>As for the honourable Member's question regarding the future of the Irish banking system, since the beginning of the crisis the Commission has always insisted on the need to ensure the viability of fragile credit institutions beyond the simple injection of additional capital. Strengthening the solvency of a financial institution effectively tackles the most acute risks but it does not guarantee the long term viability of that institution. In this context, the Commission, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Irish authorities are committed to the fulfilment of an in depth restructuring of the Irish financial system that will reduce its size and increase its efficiency and robustness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0601"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has received several complaints concerning the alleged State aid to the Dutch football clubs mentioned in the honourable Member's question. However, the alleged State support did not concern infrastructure projects but rather measures preventing those clubs from going bankrupt and assisting them to deal with financial difficulties. Currently, the Commission is carrying out a preliminary assessment of these complaints.</p>
<p>As regards the honourable Member's second question, in line with Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in order for a measure to qualify as State aid, it has to involve a transfer of State resources. Consequently, the potential State aid could result from an intervention of the public authorities and not of the club as such. Furthermore, to qualify as State aid, the measure in question has to involve an economic advantage to the beneficiary of aid, distort or threaten to distort competition, as well as to affect trade between Member States. In principle, the market character of the transactions concluded between the authorities and a given football club, is a possible way of avoiding State aid issues.</p>
<p>Given the small number of decisions taken in this field, the Commission Communication in the field of sport currently being prepared is unlikely to include such guidance.

<p>(EN) The planned Benchmarking Decision is a technical implementation act based on article 10a of the Emissions Trading Directive (2003/87/EC), as amended in the climate-energy package. Article 10a gives certain indications on how the benchmarks should be determined. In principle the Union-wide harmonised benchmarks should be established on the basis of an average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector to ensure that allocation rewards reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Directive, the benchmarks should also take account of the most efficient techniques, substitutes, alternative production processes, high efficiency cogeneration, efficient energy recovery of waste gases, use of biomass and capture and storage of CO2.</p>
<p>In particular, the Directive requires that the benchmarks are calculated for products rather than for inputs, to maximise emissions reductions and energy efficiency throughout each production process of the sector or the subsector concerned. Taking into account the local fuel availability of individual installations would therefore undermine the basic principles for benchmarks mutually agreed upon in the Emissions Trading System (ETS) Directive.</p>
<p>It is also important to recall that the emissions trading scheme is a measure, by which the carbon efficiency of production processes is internalised in the price of carbon and products, aiming at achieving reductions of emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. The benchmark-based free allocation cannot run counter to this objective.</p>
<p>As part of the political agreement on the climate-energy package, the ETS Directive also ensures a redistribution of a significant amount of auctioning revenues to certain Member States, where the historical fuel mix was an important criterion. The auctioning revenues can and should be used to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Member States can use a wide range of measures to facilitate this process, targeting infrastructure, consumers or producers; this may not only concern the industrial sector but also energy production. Insofar as support is limited to specific companies, state aid rules allow for a number of measures under certain conditions, e.g. measures to increase energy efficiency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0610"></a>

<p>(EN) As an acknowledgement of the growing problem of litter in the marine environment, the Commission organized a workshop called: Marine Litter: plastic soup and more in November 2010. The Commission was very pleased with the interest shown by different honourable Members and representatives of a wide range of different stakeholders: science, plastic producers, environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs,) local organizations as well as from Member States, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the USA National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>The report of the meeting and the presentations are available on the website of DG ENV.</p>
<p>The workshop conclusions were as follows:</p>
<p>- There is need to address both sources of waste: waste which comes from the land and from the sea-users. Partnerships with relevant stakeholders such as the shipping industry, fishermen, the offshore industry, local authorities and the producers of plastic products will need to be established.</p>
<p>- Innovations in design and in the use of different polymers, exchange of good practices and pilot projects will teach us more. And there should be a balance between the development of binding and non-binding measures. The upcoming review of the Port Reception Facility Directive will be a good opportunity to look at possible amendments to strengthen this binding measure.</p>
<p>- Cooperation and agreements with the plastic industry are essential to set reduction targets so that use can also be made of market based instruments. An annual high level event could facilitate this.</p>
<p>- There are still knowledge gaps, which must be filled. We need more and better standardized monitoring of marine litter with the EEA and within the regional seas convention areas. Further research is needed on toxicity and on the impacts of litter, especially micro-plastics.</p>
<p>- More awareness has to be created and targeted at specific groups, such as youth, consumers, municipalities, port authorities. The concept of a 'plastic footprint' or eco-labels on plastic products could assist in this difficult and challenging task.</p>
<p>- Finally, there is the international agenda at regional seas level, in coordination with UNEP, in addressing IMO/MARPOL and in cooperation with the USA towards a global approach.</p>
<p>With regard to the question of the potential use of biodegradable plastics, we learned that this type of plastic degrades well under controlled circumstances but much less so in the environment. It needs therefore to be properly collected and will in itself not solve the problem of litter on our beaches and in our seas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0612"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU has always been one of the foremost advocates of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and continues to be supportive and fully engaged in the remaining multilateral negotiations. On 24 November 2010, the EU and Russia reached a satisfactory bilateral deal in the context of Russia's accession to the WTO. This deal brings Russian WTO entry closer and opens the way for Russia to accede in 2011, provided the outstanding multilateral negotiations are completed. The EU will continue to assist Russia in its technical work towards this goal.</p>
<p>The EU is interested in further deepening economic integration with Russia. A closer economic relationship would benefit both parties if it would lead to greater mutual market access, remove trade barriers, further improve the business climate and open up possibilities for investment.</p>
<p>In the current negotiations between the EU and Russia of a new bilateral Agreement to replace and update the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the EU would like to incorporate substantial trade and investment related provisions for the benefit of both Parties since this could be an important first step to furthering a closer economic community between the EU and Russia.</p>
<p>A future bilateral preferential arrangement is also desirable for the EU. However, in this respect the implications of the Customs Union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan need to be clarified by the Russian side.</p>
<p>Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are advancing very rapidly in terms of establishing the legal and regulatory framework of the Customs Union. This has resulted in considerable changes to the previous trade regime, for example a new common external tariff and a new Customs Code. Technical regulation and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are also being harmonised and there are plans to extend this harmonisation into other areas. The Commission is monitoring progress with a focus on the effect these new rules have on its bilateral trade and investment relations and their compatibility with WTO rules.</p>
<p>The Customs Union in itself is not an obstacle to WTO accession, provided that its rules are WTO-compatible. Russia has recently declared that it intends to join the WTO on an individual basis and guarantee that all of its WTO obligations will be implemented upon accession.

<p>(FR) It is important for the legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the future of the CAP that, firstly, payments go to active farmers (in other words, farmers who are actively engaged in agricultural production or the supply of public goods and who make a real contribution to the CAP objectives) and, secondly, that we exclude so-called ‘sofa farmers’, who receive payments without doing anything.</p>
<p>This is a very complex issue, because exclusion rules that are too broad and too general could inadvertently penalise real farmers, particularly part-time ones.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining ways of expressing this political will in legal terms. A number of criteria are being examined that could be used at EU level. Whatever decision is made, it should not compromise the decoupled nature of payments or their classification in the WTO Green Box, nor should it result in the unequal treatment of farmers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0615"></a>

<p>(FR) The Bulgarian authorities informed the Commission in October 2010 that Mrs Kalina Ilieva had been removed from her post on 7 October 2010.</p>
<p>Community rules state that paying agencies shall ensure that appropriate human resources are allocated to carry out operations and that the technical skills required at different levels of operations are present.</p>
<p>However, the appointment and management of directors within national paying agencies is the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission cannot intervene in this matter.</p>
<p>Provided that the aid applications were approved by Mrs Ilieva (as the officially appointed executive director) after satisfactory checks had been carried out to verify that they complied with Community rules, the payments made whilst she was in post must be considered to have been approved pursuant to the procedures in force.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian authorities have confirmed to the Commission that operations within the paying agency will continue. Indeed, one of its vice-presidents (Mr Svetoslav Simeonov, Vice-President in charge of SAPARD and Fisheries) has been made acting head of the paying agency pending the appointment of the next President.</p>
<p>The responsibility for accrediting a given paying agency and for monitoring it on an ongoing basis to ensure that it complies with the accreditation criteria lies with the ‘competent authority’ at national level (in this case the Ministry of Agriculture and Food). As an additional safeguard, an independent audit body (the certification body) examines and reports annually on compliance with the accrediation criteria by the paying agency.</p>
<p>The certification body is due to submit its report on the 2010 financial year on 1 February 2011.</p>
<p>Its conclusions will, as always, be carefully assessed by the services of the Commission, and any identified shortcomings will be followed up by on-site audit bodies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
