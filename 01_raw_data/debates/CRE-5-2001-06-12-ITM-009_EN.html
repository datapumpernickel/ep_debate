<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, soon I will be joining the ranks of the trade politicians and then at least I will get an invitation to a cocktail party. For the rest, however, I have no trouble at all in joining in this debate because in this very area which we are now called on to discuss, that is ASEM, we also have to ensure that we have increased parliamentary participation. That is why we also propose in our report that there should be a second ASEP parliamentary conference before the ASEM IV Summit. Clever executives always get parliaments involved when foreign policy or trade are at issue. That is why we ask in this connection in the report – and this is one of the most important requests that we make – that the Council and in particular also the Commission should keep the European Parliament informed of developments in this area. In particular, they should also report on the implementation of the decisions made at each meeting: this information could then be fed into a process of parliamentary supervision which could be used to speed up progress. I believe that this is in the common interest because this particular initiative, ASEM, is of such exceptional importance.</p>
<p class="contents">If both groups – the European Union in Europe and ASEAN in Asia –, which are after all stable, work together with other states in Asia and manage to cooperate closely in such important areas as the three pillars identified within this process, namely political, economic and cultural dialogue, this can have undreamt-of implications for stability in these regions and throughout the world. That is why I believe that we should take this ASEAN process as seriously as possible, place greater emphasis on it and make it a higher priority.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will illustrate this by way of a few examples. If we manage to table a number of political proposals at the ASEM III Summit, which we are reporting on here, and then also in the run-up to ASEM IV – for example in the area of conflict prevention – then I believe that a considerable amount can be achieved here. You only have to think of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan or North and South Korea. I believe that together in a multilateral process of this kind we can make an important contribution to the situation developing peacefully and decisions being made which benefit the people in the region concerned, but also foster peaceful development in the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should simply like to recall the issue of the proliferation of weapons, because we do actually have political contacts and relations with one or two of the ASEM members, or we have developed mutually dependent relationships with them, and through this it is possible to exert considerable influence to prevent the dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and carrier weapons. In this way we can make a contribution to world peace.</p>
<p class="contents">If we also succeed in internalising this political process and implementing the commitments made in respect of the rule of law, democracy and human rights there, then this is very significant, not only for human rights and the rule of law, but also for the stability of the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic area, these two groups, which are working together in Asia, should also see to it that they use their combined weight to foster positive global economic development, by preparing for WTO negotiations together and by cooperating fruitfully in international fora and the UN. They should ensure that there is greater stability in the field of financial services and, where trade agreements are concerned, they should ensure that social standards are gradually raised across the board so as to contribute to there being greater justice in this world.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in addition, we manage to be active in the third pillar, in the area of cultural relations, by involving people, groups and those working in the cultural sector, and in this way bring people together, because cultural relations do after all lead to ties being formed, then this would seem to be a further important starting point for making a decisive contribution to greater stability in our world.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to table specific proposals for the next ASEM conference in its working document on the development plan for the ASEM process in the next decade and to discuss these with us. Commissioner Patten, I am sure that we will do this in a joint dialogue drawing on your experience in this region, so that we will be able to make a contribution to creating a better world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But, quite honestly, we should also admit that the results of the ASEM III Summit in Seoul last year were not so terribly significant. Many assertions remained very vague and if you look at how many of them have been put into practice you will see that we actually still have work to do on many of them. In this respect I fully share the views of our committee chairman. Commissioner, I think that we are acting as allies when we ask you to table a report on the preparations for ASEM IV, so that both of us – the Commission and Parliament – as we say in Hamburg, have a bit of butter with our fish, that is, actually introduce some substance into the preparations for ASEM IV in Copenhagen next year. We would ask you to provide us with a very substantial report as soon as possible so that we can debate with you, but also with the Council, which areas further negotiations should really focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one additional comment. I should like to take up once more what Mr Brok said about conflict prevention, but also about conflict resolution. We are in the business of helping each other. I need only recall that the Japanese donate a considerable amount of development aid to south-eastern Europe – our area – so as to express their solidarity with us on matters of security policy, and we should not therefore shy away from taking part in discussions about conflict resolution or providing assistance in this respect either, whether it be in China, Taiwan, North Korea or South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further comment which is on the tip of my tongue, Commissioner. Consider the following: this initiative involves ten Asian countries and fifteen European countries. There will soon be eighteen or twenty countries on the European side. We should maintain a balance. That is why I think it is important for us to consider to what extent it might be possible for the Asian side also to admit more members. I believe, for example, that a country like India, which is significant on the one hand because of its abundant population but on the other because of its democratic structure and experience, could be a good partner. Perhaps you could discuss this briefly with your Asian colleagues even in the run-up to ASEM IV, so that we have balanced coverage of both geographical areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we agree here: we need to make it clear in the political discussion that Asia's relations with Europe are of decisive importance, and we should help each other in this respect. In conclusion, I should once again like to refer to Mr Brok's opening comments. Relations between states are of course negotiated formally by their governments. But I would say to the Heads of State and Government: civil servants and ministers need the support of members of parliament. That is why the committee's idea…</p>

Along with the just focus on Europe and surrounding areas, and on the transatlantic dialogue, Asian relations should form the third pillar of the EU’s foreign policy. We cannot afford to leave Asia in the care of the Americans, despite the fact that their military presence is far more conspicuous. We have not reached that stage yet. Irrespective of the geographical distance and cultural differences, there are major political points of discussion. Fortunately, these are high on the agenda in the ASEM process. The EU does well to continue to underline the human rights issue, even in cases of social abuse. We do not believe in the universality of “Asian values”, and these are increasingly consigned to the background in the region itself, which is evident from the democratic breakthroughs of the past decade. However, that does not eliminate the causes of conflicts, such as poverty and ethnic and religious conflicts. I would refer to Indonesia, but also to the need for permanent intervention in the Korea issue. We welcome the fact that the European Union is committed. Alongside the US, Europe must claim a more global role. At the same time, we should not punch above our weight, for then we will remain bogged down in fine words. Asia is large, and Asians will mainly need to solve their problems themselves. The ASEM process, preferably enlarged to include a country such as India, must be more than a discussion forum. We must strengthen the mutual interests on the basis of equality. That will bring Asia and Europe closer together. Those interests are mainly in the economic field. That is where Europe can be of most significance, and there is great potential, given the interconnectedness of the world economy. We would also call for a far more intensive cultural exchange to prevent the ASEM process from remaining an elitist affair. If we draw in the reins more tightly, Europe will be able to better embed its expectations in permanent political dialogue. The emphasis in this connection is on democracy and human rights. However, we should not neglect the safety aspects. Preventing the proliferation or spread of nuclear weapons also springs to mind, for example. However, the ASEM process is not an alternative to sound bilateral relations with Asia’s major countries. Asia cannot be compared to the European Union. It is unclear which country will in time be at the helm in that region. There are major paradoxes. China is developing fast, but is not a democracy. India is large, but vulnerable, and the Japanese engine is misfiring. Europe can help improve regional perspectives, but that should not be at the expense of the direct involvement of the countries in that region. Direct criticism pertaining to special situations should not get lost in multilateral declarations. The region is not served by organised silence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, we already talked last year about ASEM’s Summit in Seoul and, on behalf of my group, I then expressed my disappointment at the outcome, not about ASEM as such, and certainly not about the Commission’s attitude or about that of our Commissioner, which bore witness to a vision and was very intelligent. We were disappointed about the attitude of our Council: the EU ministers had to be dragged to this Summit kicking and screaming. One could be forgiven for thinking it was a Parliament meeting: that was the level of unwillingness that was displayed about going! Their presence did not reveal any sense of involvement. I therefore believe that the meeting was quite a bit weaker than it could otherwise have been.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, understandable. Ministers have to attend so many summit meetings: every other week, they have to attend some summit or other. But if they started by handing over EU matters to the European Commission and the European Parliament, that would free up a considerable amount of time in their diaries and might well lead to decisions which the public could back more. But that is another matter.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is not terribly exciting, except maybe for the point about issuing visas for authorities from Taiwan. This is an important point, in our view. It is odd, to say the least, that a President such as Mr Chen, who has, after all, been democratically elected, cannot enter the European Union, even in a private capacity. The United States has been issuing visas in this connection for much longer.</p>
<p class="contents">We will no doubt be backing some amendments by the GUE Group. But some of their other amendments seem to emanate from the Chinese friendship association, and we will not be supporting those.</p>
<p class="contents">We did find Mr Dupuis’ original report exciting. That report is truly radical in its appeal for a coherent strategy aimed at more democracy and the development of the rule of law, which is also important for the development of the economy. We need no longer place the main focus of policy on China. There is an entire region which is of importance to us, and expansion to include a country such as India, for example, would be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the ASEM process is of major importance to us. We would also like to see MEPs become more involved. We are looking forward to the talks on ASEM IV. We hope and trust that the European Commission will be closely involving us in that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Initially it was a report which I in the committee saw as a diplomatic declaration of war on the People’s Republic of China, which was naturally not the intention. Thanks to the combined efforts of the committee, the report has been radically amended and is now more to do with what its title indicated it was intended to be about. It is largely acceptable to us in the Green Group but some problems still remain. The first is point 21, which attacks the Chinese demographic policy which naturally has many different aspects. The fact is, however, that it is in the process of being changed quite radically. As recently as just a month or so ago the <span class="italic">New York Times </span>–<span class="italic"> </span>of all papers – contained reportage which described in very positive terms how the one-child policy was being <span class="italic">changed </span>quite thoroughly and radically. In this situation I think it is quite unnecessary of us in the European Parliament to attack the Chinese population policy as one-sidedly as in point 21.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is about visas for Taiwan’s top leaders. I have to admit that I think this is quite difficult. In Swedish debates I have criticised visas not being given to these top Taiwanese leaders. On the other hand I have understood that the People’s Republic of China sees this as us attempting to change practice and more or less indirectly begin to recognise the State of Taiwan, which is no-one’s intention. This is clearly problematic. For my part I will abstain from the vote on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has done this, on the other one hand, by transforming the unfortunate and aggressive initial draft and, on the other, by taking on board that the agreements of the Third ASEM Conference in Seoul have replaced the initial proposals contained in the European Commission’s original document.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the enormous importance for the world, globally, and for the European Union specifically, of the improvement in relations between these two regions of the world – the European Union and Asia. And this is the case in all respects: economic, social, cultural, scientific and political.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the current conflicts and problems, Asia is the most dynamic region in the world. It contains three giants: Japan, China and India, which are going to be increasingly important on the international stage. Relations between the European Union and this region must therefore be particularly prudent and positive and at the same time help towards a negotiated and peaceful solution to the problems which are the result of an immediate past originating in the Cold War, as well as the colonial past.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective should be to contribute to the world enjoying a multipolar situation in which international law, peace and economic and social development – which is just and balanced – should have increasing importance, and human, union and social rights and democracy should flourish as an everyday reality.</p>
<p class="contents">China’s access to the World Trade Organisation has been important and the European Union must therefore maintain a special relationship with China in this respect. We therefore believe that, at the Fourth Summit in Copenhagen, parliaments, both European and Asian, must play an ever more important role as representatives of popular sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It offers the Asian and European government leaders the opportunity of consulting each other every two years on truly strategic problems. And it is precisely this fixed regular forum that can have an inhibiting effect on aggressive, unilateral action taken by one of the ASEM participants.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the real fear which various Asian States experience within the ASEM process: that of the Chinese pursuit of regional supremacy, including territorial demands. A case in point is the on-going controversy regarding Beijing’s claim of sovereignty over the South China Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Via multilateral forums, such as the ASEM process, those Asian countries hope to enhance, and mainly stabilise, existing bilateral relations with China. It is therefore no wonder that these smaller Asian States advocate a higher level of commitment by the 15 EU Member States to the ASEM process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add two minor observations regarding this resolution. The first one concerns recital K, in which democratic Japan receives the very dubious honour of being blamed for an unprecedented, post-war political crisis and in which a very harsh judgment is passed on the country’s political establishment. On account of Asian pride, and not just that of the Japanese, such an arrogant Western judgment is nothing short of a slap in the face. From this angle, the European Parliament makes anything but a constructive contribution to the ASEM process.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, various other Asian ASEM Members probably deal with much more serious domestic problems than that in this day and age. The ever more strife-torn Indonesian archipelago is a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, due to political imbalance and careless use of language, recital K is completely inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the draft resolution, in which an appeal is made to the European Council and Commission, as well as to the other ASEM Members, for an Asian expansion of ASEM parallel to the approaching European enlargement, namely the forthcoming accession of the candidate countries to the Union. Three countries are mentioned in this connection: India, Australia and New Zealand. However, honourable European intentions collide here with Asian realities, or rather national sensitivities. In Asian eyes, Australia and New Zealand are still seen as foreign bodies. In short, their ASEM membership will require the necessary time and, probably, Europe’s power of persuasion. As far as India is concerned, the People’s Republic of China is not what one would call hospitable. From that point of view, national barriers still need to be lifted. Not only – as is currently so evident – in the EU’s enlargement process, but also in ASEM. However, when good intentions are coupled with political action to match, we are certain to make headway in Europe and Asia, even jointly, in fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, our own actions rarely live up to our promises. In the past, too many Member States have paid lip-service to the idea, but where there is a choice between trade and defence of human rights, economic self-interest has always taken precedence. Furthermore, where a small country is involved, we have been quick to criticise, but when the offender is a large country, such as China, our response has been much more muted and I very much welcome Commissioner Patten's recent remarks in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I support the proposal contained in paragraph 10 of the report which calls for any state to be excluded which clearly fails to respect human rights, democracy and the rule of law from ASEM activities. I also welcome the proposal for the political pillar of ASEM to encourage political dialogue in several areas, including between China and Taiwan. If we want to play a role in this and want to be seen as honest brokers, then all Member States should follow the recommendation of this report and grant visas to the Taiwanese President and members of the government for private visits to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the reference to resolving the conflict in Sri Lanka given my recent involvement in this area as head of the EU electoral observation mission. Over 70 000 Sri Lankans have died in this conflict since 1973 and any initiative to prevent further loss of life would be very worthwhile. To conclude these brief remarks, I commend the Brok report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This new partnership between Europe and Asia gives both sides a golden opportunity to deepen and strengthen relations, in respect not only of the economy, but also political, social and cultural matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as the third ASEM Summit in Seoul political aspects such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law were successfully promoted from being the subject of a fruitful dialogue between the partners in the ASEM process to prompting relevant undertakings from leading ASEM politicians. It will come as no surprise to anyone to learn that our Parliament, which has made these values the focus of its work for years, attaches quite particular importance to these same values being respected by the Council and the Commission and to the Council and the Commission doing all they can to make these values part and parcel of the ongoing political dialogue with our Asian partners in the ASEM process.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the European Union is almost talking about nothing else but enlargement, it is, I believe, very appropriate to say that this ASEM process and the circle of partners within it should also be extended to include states like India, which might also be deemed to have earned a place in this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address two points which, in my view, have wrongly become the subject of talks with and occasional protests on the part of the Chinese Embassy. Our requiring Taiwan's politicians to have visas for private visits to Europe does not amount to recognition of the Republic of Taiwan or in fact anything at all; it is the pursuance of a consistent policy which Europe has on the freedom of movement of people, consistent in particular if in the future Taiwan were also to follow in China's footsteps and become a member of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to an old demand of the European Parliament: we have always said that with a region such as Taiwan, with which we in Europe have very intensive economic relations, our relations are such as to warrant a representation, that is an information office, being set up there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know how much effort Parliament has put into producing this report. I should like to point out a number of facts. Firstly, the history of the 20th Century has left deep wounds in Asia which have not yet healed. The bloody suppression of the Boxer Uprising in China, the occupation of Manchuria, the Korean War and the aggression against Vietnam are all inextricably linked with the names of states which belong to the exclusive club of the great countries of this world: the USA, Germany and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a peculiar way of perceiving the role and responsibility of states if, given this historical background, it wishes for example to assign Japan a kind of policeman's role in Asia. It is equally disconcerting that the EU is not distancing itself more decisively from the confrontation course which the USA is adopting, for example with its spy planes, against China.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a second point. In Asia, the future depends largely on there being harmonious relations and a balance of interests between China, India and also Russia. Any attempts to play these countries off against each other would seem to me to be very dangerous, including and even in particular for Europe! A sustainable Asian policy must be directed at partnership and constructive dialogue, and not least with the People's Republic of China. Anyone who relies now on short-term interests and gaining a quick advantage will not in the long term be able to make a decisive political contribution to establishing peace, cooperation and partnership between Europe and Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the start of this new decade, a new multipower system is gradually taking shape before our very eyes and, as the European Union, we should make this our strategic choice. In this sense, this proposal for the coming decade is clearly a political proposal with strategic overtones. The single superpower system has entered its next stage and is being replaced by a multipower system and it is precisely at this stage that we, the European Union, should strengthen all the regional initiatives which bring about the rule of law, which bring about economic growth, which bring about social justice and which allow any differences to be resolved peacefully and without conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Αsia, which is the subject of today's debate, is an area in which numerous regions – Pakistan, India, Indonesia and others – are in conflict. These conflicts have complicated root causes. And we, whose job is to send a message not just to the nations of Europe with ideological and political problems, but to the entire world, must act as a force for peace, as a force for cooperation, as a force for progress and as a force for democracy by strengthening the procedures which civilise the world without creating conflict, without there being any cause for conflict and without starting by using military conflict or considerations in order to bring about democratic results.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the committee report presented by Mr Brok is a serious text, far more serious than the Commission proposal, which will, I think, adhere closely to it, within the bounds of what is viable, in order to bring about the anticipated political results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not the point. Despite the amendments made to the original Dupuis report, the guiding spirit behind the Brok report is still crass intervention in the internal affairs of the ASEM countries in the name of the so-called rule of law, human rights etc. etc.</p>
<p class="contents">And just what human rights can anyone who proposes such things as respect for the world trade order be talking about? Crass intervention in purely internal affairs in the countries in the area up to and including condemnation of the democratic policy of the People's Republic of China, a country which the European Union has obviously set its sights on. Conspicuous by its absence is any reference whatsoever to the fact that peace in the area is in jeopardy now that the United States has stepped up its aggression towards China, as seen in the NMD, the new US defence philosophy, flights on spying missions, the visits by the Dalai Lama and the President of Taiwan. But the report does not omit to call – twice – for visas to be granted to members of the government of Taiwan, thereby mimicking the American tactic on this issue.

As sensational as the first ASEM Summit was, relations in very many areas are in fact now perceived as normal. It is particularly when I think of cultural relations and of the very fruitful work of the Asia-Europe Foundation in Singapore that I sometimes realise that there are more encounters involving schools, students, scientists and also managers than involving politicians. That is why I should like to recall once more here that this European Parliament once said – and on one occasion it also made this a reality – that in the same way that there was a summit between governments there should be a summit between parliaments. I believe that it is absolutely essential for contacts between parliaments in Europe and Asia to be intensified and that, before the next ASEM Summit in Copenhagen at the latest, we should put in place a stringent process to monitor these important joint political initiatives, even if some of them are based on conflicting principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I really believe that this is essential because both regions are playing an important part in reforming the United Nations and also the World Trade Organisation. It is also in both regions' interests for progress to be made on security for their people and mankind in general. I am thinking here both of food safety and the fight against organised crime. There really is no limit to the forms which cooperation might take here, and in this respect Europe really needs to move forward. We are fortunate to have been able to initiate a process of reflection on security policy in ASEAN and throughout the Asian area.</p>
<p class="contents">A further matter which is of concern to me is that we should help to combat trafficking in human beings. We are now faced with a situation where millions of people have been abducted, and they are no longer only women and children but also men. I think that both regions of the world have a responsibility here to put an end to this form of freedom of movement on this earth.</p>

It is not the case that we are free to decide with no adverse consequences whether to become involved there or whether to opt out; no, the countries in this part of Asia have very particular and well-founded expectations that the Europeans will become engaged in their part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These expectations exist because there the power of the United States of America in terms of both the economy and security is an established fact and because China is next door and is gaining increasing influence. In this power play, the expectations of many states in South-East Asia are focused on the Europeans considering establishing what the Asians call a strategic partnership, obviously with the aim of producing greater stability and creating a balance between the major powers there in the interests of the Asian states. These have had their first experiences of rapid economic growth which was then slowed by the crisis, and now they see that they have an opportunity to leave this crisis behind. At the same time they realise how essential it is for them to find their way out of the crisis in partnership with others, and not least with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, as I have said, it is not simply a question of our own interests, how and on what conditions we get involved there; instead we are in a situation where expectations are pinned on us. That is why we are not free either to say, no we will do that or we will leave that; we are obliged to become involved in this part of the world. This opens up huge possibilities. If we behave there, not as colonialists as we did in the past, but as partners who are prepared to contribute their own experiences alongside those of another continent, we will be listened to. Under no circumstances must we Europeans let this opportunity pass us by! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – First of all may I thank the House for the attention that honourable Members are paying, not only to relations between the European Union and Asia, but also to the ASEM process in particular. The significant interest that this report has triggered also demonstrates how important Asia is for our Union, a point very well made by a number of speakers. As I am sure the House will understand, this is a subject on which I have certain views myself.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares to a very large extent the evaluation and concerns expressed in the report, in particular those regarding the importance of further strengthening our dialogue with Asian-ASEM partners on political, as well as on economic and social issues. We also think that ASEM should be concentrating upon issues of global concern.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that we keep coming back to is the importance that we attach to the three pillars, political, economic and cultural-social, developing at the same pace. Some of our Asian partners are more interested in having a predominantly economic dialogue, letting the political dialogue lag behind. The Asian partners fear interference in their internal affairs and see the different levels of development as an obstacle to the advocated partnership of equals. The Commission does not share this view and nor do other European partners. Development cooperation itself is, of course, dealt with in other fora, but ASEM is and should remain a forum for dialogue among equal partners.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ago I attended the third ASEM foreign ministers meeting in Beijing. We addressed a multitude of issues. We did not agree on all of them, but there would be no point in having a dialogue if we saw everything identically. At the same time, the need to improve the management of the ASEM process is extremely clear. These very broad agendas – there were 19 items on our agenda for the foreign ministers' meeting – lead to a lack of focus. That is why we have proposed to cluster activities. That is why we have suggested informal, retreat-style meetings for the highest level of participants to allow them to concentrate upon a few key issues. These issues should have some ASEM added value; in other words it must make sense to deal with them on a bi-regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be a high degree of consensus on the need for reform. We agreed on the need to cut down on pre-prepared speeches and pre-cooked and usually over-boiled chairmen's statements, which no one ever reads. I become profoundly suspicious of the added value of meetings where most of the real dialogue takes place beforehand in discussions on the joint statement to be issued, and at which as many people are present as at a less important football match in my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">We need more focus, more dialogue, and more concentration on the principal participants and on fewer subjects. There should be more scope for free discussion and bilateral meetings. For example, I had a very useful first exchange with the new Thai foreign minister and we also held European Union troika meetings with Indonesia and with China.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive step forward is that our Asian partners seem more inclined to increase the involvement of civil society. We have also discussed the importance of involving parliamentarians in the process. Young parliamentarians have met under the auspices of ASEF, the Asia-Europe foundation. Perhaps it is time to go further and revive exchanges between parliamentarians from the ASEM countries, so I warmly welcome the intention to call a second Asia-Europe parliamentary meeting before the Copenhagen Summit in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted by the calls for greater involvement of Parliament in the ASEM process. This is the third time that I have had the opportunity to discuss ASEM in Parliament. The first occasion was a very intimate one, there were two other Members of the House present that evening with me. We shared a sort of post-candlelight supper together. The second occasion we discussed ASEM, there were three other Members of Parliament in the Chamber with me. Today we have seen what can only be seen as an exponential growth in the interest in ASEM and I hope that before my five years are up on 22 January 2005 the Chamber will be packed when we discuss the relationship with ASEM and with Asia as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the request for a new working document in advance of the Copenhagen ASEM meeting and I hope we will be able to have something further to say on EU-Asia relations generally. I expect to return to Parliament shortly to discuss a new communication intended to update the 1994 Asia strategy. This is scheduled for adoption by the Commission in July and it will provide us with an occasion for a wider debate on EU-Asia relations. It will need to cover the sort of points raised by a number of Members in this debate, including the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Mr Marset Campos.</p>
<p class="contents">Our recent visit to the Korean peninsula demonstrated that the European Union has considerable interests well beyond the arc of instability which surrounds the Union from Kaliningrad in the north to the southern Caucasus in the south. My own recent visit to China demonstrated the importance of the European Union there too. It is worth recalling that today China has a 45 billion euro trade surplus with the European Union. When I was in China I was delighted that I was able to meet members of the Chinese Parliament who, like me, expressed wonder at some of the continuing evidence of Chinese economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as Mr Cushnahan said, we have to talk about other issues as well as trade and commercial relations. We cannot have a frank political dialogue with China without having an equally frank exchange about human rights. That is not meant to sound superior and we are not asserting that Europe somehow has a monopoly of wisdom on human rights. But it is our unshakeable view that human rights have universal validity and that a dialogue about human rights is appropriate in all our relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted what the honourable Member said about the development of our external services in Asia. I hope that is a point we will be able to be more open about in a few weeks' time in the communication we are about to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">I could have talked about Japan. I could have talked about South-East Asia. There are a number of subjects which we need to discuss in more detail. There are many reasons for arguing, as the honourable Member did a few moments ago, that the relationship we have with Asia is an exceptionally important part of our external relations overall. I very much hope that in the coming weeks and months we will have many further opportunities of discussing it in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
