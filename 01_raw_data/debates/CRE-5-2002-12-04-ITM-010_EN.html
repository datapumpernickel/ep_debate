<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jillian (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, it is estimated that around 12 million vertebrate animals are used annually in the European Union for the development and the testing of drugs, vaccines, chemicals and other products. A further nine million are bred and destroyed as surplus to requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Directive 86/609, which controls the use of animals in experiments, was first implemented more than 16 years ago, a great deal has changed. The original purpose of the Directive was to avoid distortions in trade. The European Union did not then have a duty, as it does now, to consider the welfare of animals in agriculture, research, transport or single market policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, animal welfare is the subject of extensive public debate and interest and concern about the use of animals has escalated. Also, enormous progress has been made in scientific knowledge and practice. For these reasons, as well as deficiencies in the actual operation of the Directive, with many cases of infringement action taken by the Commission over the years, it is clear that this Directive is in urgent need of revision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already made a commitment to review the Directive next year. I hope that the points on which we have focussed in this report will guide their work because there are many lessons to be learnt. The first is the need for a central European Union inspectorate to coordinate the work of inspectors in the Member States but with the power to visit facilities and revoke licences if necessary. In 1986, Parliament called for a standing committee to monitor the implementation of the Directive but it was not done. I believe this has proved to be a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">There is great variation between the Member States in the way that information is collated and in the way that replacement, reduction and refinement are applied. For example, the Commission has already published two sets of statistics on the number and use of animals in experiments. The data is required every three years. It does not have to contain very much detail and there has been no standard format for presenting it. Some Member States publish very detailed statistics annually while others publish the bare minimum as infrequently as possible. This has made evaluating the implementation of the Directive difficult. We need data to be published annually and in a standard format.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of alternative testing methods is, of course, central. Animal experiments should be seen as exceptions to the rule rather than normal scientific procedures. Work on alternatives is progressing fast. This is where Member States should be concentrating and giving priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Related to this is Article 7(2) of this Directive, which states that animals should be used for experiments only where there is no scientifically viable alternative. Given that the Commission does not currently require detailed information on statistics, it is impossible to monitor whether this article is actually being implemented. That is why the report recommends a central EU database including information on all animal experiments approved, currently performed and finalised. This would allow for EU-wide checks to ensure that article was being implemented and that experiments were not being duplicated.</p>
<p class="contents">While the number of animals used for experiments had appeared to be reducing, the use of transgenic animals is rising. This is something that could not have been foreseen in 1986 when the Directive was adopted. There is inadequate provision for it in the Directive as a result. Transgenic animals must be included.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many complaints from NGOs and other bodies and organisations relate to breaches of Article 5 on the general care and accommodation of animals. This can largely be overcome by an EU-wide standard training course including animal welfare and the ethics of experiments.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four amendments to the report. I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment. I would also like to thank Mr Nisticò in particular for discussing his amendments with me. I regret that I cannot support amendments 1 and 2 as they weaken the report considerably on a point which is of great concern, that is, the use of primates, especially wild caught primates. I can support Amendment No 3.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is general agreement in Parliament and in the Commission that Directive 86/609 is neither suitable nor effective today and that we need new legislation. I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament's recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Parliament and Mrs Evans for the initiative and the work accomplished. The report comes at the right moment to maintain the momentum for the in-depth revision of the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 2003, we will convene a meeting of a technical expert working group. Experts from all stakeholders should elaborate on specific issues including those raised in the report. However, I would just like to say that development and testing of weapons on animals and the respective ban proposed in the report are not covered by Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The report further highlights several cases of incorrect transposition of the Directive into Member States' national legislation and cases of incorrect practical application. We have been actively pursuing these cases and therefore four out of the nine cases presented in the report have already been successfully closed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I consider the report to be most welcome. It provides the key elements for the in-depth revision of the Directive. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support for the two-step approach we have taken for amending the Directive. The first step is currently under way and concerns the inclusion of the procedure for technical adaptation into the Directive. Parliament adopted the proposal in July 2002 without amendments. However, a modification in the wording has recently become necessary and Council is likely to adopt a common position. Therefore, for the second reading, I would like to ask you again for a rapid adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">The second step for amending the Directive will, of course, be the in-depth revision. I would again like to emphasise that I consider the Parliament's report as an important input and I hope that I can count on Parliament's continued support in our efforts to further improve the welfare of animals used in experiments in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Directive 86/609 establishes boundaries and standards which the individual countries of the European Union have to respect in order to ensure maximum protection for animals: I hope that these are applied throughout the European Union. We must remember, however, that the people who devote their lives to scientific research are skilled professionals, as are the Commission’s scientific consultants, who are therefore fully aware of this responsibility and perform experiments with the noble aim of eliminating diseases which are still incurable and fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we need to acknowledge that, for certain specific purposes, it is still necessary to use subhuman primates today. It is necessary for the purposes of assessing the effectiveness and safety of Aids vaccines – every year, another two million people die – for the production of monoclonal antibody vaccines to fight diseases such as cancer, polio, tuberculosis or malaria, and where there are no alternative methods in existence. To prohibit these types of experiments on primates would be to jeopardise the lives of a great many children and adults, Commissioner, depriving them of drugs and vaccines which are essential for the preservation of their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled three amendments. I am going to withdraw the second, but Amendments Nos 1 and 3 stand as before. Amendment No 1 is particularly important to me, and I therefore hope that reason will prevail over emotion tomorrow, for No 1 is of fundamental importance for the protection of human health itself. If Amendment No 1 is not adopted, I shall regrettably be forced – as I have already told the rapporteur – to abstain in the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we were right to highlight the Member States’s poor implementation of the 1986 directive. I also think that the report shows very clearly the need for tightening up the current rules. I can fully support the Commission’s being obliged, by no later than next year, to table a proposal regarding the way in which animal experiments are to be regulated in future. Among the areas I would earmark for tightening up is the area of application. I think it important that animal experiments should also cover the use of animals for educational purposes, and we must look at the conditions under which transgenic and genetically modified animals are used in experiments. We must establish some clear ethical rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is very important for us to obtain a central database for approved animal experiments, both current and completed and both successful and manifestly unsuccessful. I think it important that we obtain a combined database of this kind so that we avoid repeating experiments that have already been carried out. Finally, I want to support Mrs Evans's idea of obtaining better supervision of the circumstances in which animals are kept, possibly through a common EU inspectorate that can help ensure that the rules are observed. May I say that I am able to support Amendment No 3 and that there will be a free vote on Amendment No 4 in the Group of the Party of European Socialists. On the other hand, we are unable to support Amendments Nos 1 and 2. I am looking forward to a proposal from the Commission that will live up to the expectations to which – inspired by Mrs Evans – Parliament’s report has given expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I firmly believe that we are not bound to love animals but that we do have a duty to respect them. This, too, is a way of measuring the degree of civilisation of a people. The almost complete lack of attention on the part of many of the Member States to the need for proper implementation of Directive 86/609 on animals used for experimental purposes, the appalling shortcomings of the directive itself and the delay in realising the need for it to be updated are confirmation of at least two things: firstly, that animal welfare is a taboo subject in this wealthy, opulent Europe, and secondly, that international economic lobbies are still succeeding in preventing free, political debate on certain subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">Admitting, as I do, that scientific progress includes animal experimentation does not mean allowing the Member States to flout and repeatedly violate standards and to subject laboratory animals to unnecessary suffering. Therefore, the European Commission must speed up its reform process in this area and step up its control and monitoring of non-compliant States, and Parliament, without allowing there to be tension between its head and its heart, must summon up the courage, with the resolution before us today, to take up arms and wage ideological war against the egoism and evil ways of mankind and, without jeopardising scientific research, confirm our unquestionable duty to respect defenceless animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted with this report. My thanks to the Commissioner for what she has just said. I am delighted that my proposed amendments were accepted by everyone in the Committee on the Environment. My thanks also to my friend Mr Nisticò, even if there is one question we disagree on. I think it is morally reprehensible to take primates from the wild. If we feel we cannot do without them, then we must breed them.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country where we would no longer dare keep such animals in a zoo, not even the Schönbrunner Zoo, the oldest and most beautiful zoo in the world. The last time a pharmaceutical company dared to bring two chimpanzees to Austria from Africa, they were rescued. They now live, much beloved by the public, as Liesl and Hiasl in an animal rescue centre in Vienna. As one famous English legal practitioner once said, you do not ask yourself, can animals think, can animals talk? No, you ask yourself, can they suffer? And that they certainly can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That, of course, has made the whole debate briefer because it is not interrogatory.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say two things. Firstly, it is extraordinary that a Directive promulgated in 1986 has still not been properly implemented in some Member States. If Ms Evan's report does nothing else, it has brought to our attention the need to speed up the process, because that is at the heart of the reform of our procedures generally: implementation, how it is done, rather than innovation, is now always the motto.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Lund about Mr Nisticò's amendments. I have to say with great respect that I do not think I can support Amendments Nos 1 or 2 which he has withdrawn. The reason, very simply, is that it seems to me to devalue animals caught in the wild, as though they are a cheap supply that can be brought in whilst all our concern goes towards zoo-bred animals and the contents of laboratories. I also feel that we need to look very carefully in this Directive at exactly how the process of experimentation will go in the future. We have this triptych here neatly from Ms Evans: replacement, reduction and scaling down. I would add reflection – we ought to reflect before every experiment is carried out. Why are we doing this? Is it being duplicated? What will the results be? It will be a good day for Parliament if we can do this as well as for the animals under consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each speaker has explained his position calmly and resolutely, and, indeed, I do not even want to use all the time available to me for fear of repeating what has already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 86/609 laid down provisions which reflected the – as yet quite limited – understanding of that time. Over 15 years have passed since that directive, during which time I would say it has had hardly any effect at all, for every day we receive news not of progressive alignment with the directive but of ill-treatment of animals and unlawful behaviour. The States have to a large degree failed to comply with the directive; the whole of society – human society as well as, of course, the animal kingdom – has not felt protected. The report contains a number of very specific provisions on the behaviour of what are, indeed, major countries – Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom – which have behaved in different ways but, in any case, in such a manner as to justify the assertion that almost all the States have failed to comply with the directive for a long time. This failure to comply has taken different forms but it is still failure to comply. Few countries in the European Union have escaped criticism, and that may well be because they were not yet part of the European Union at the time in question and have therefore not been assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there must be an undertaking in this regard. The report’s proposals are certainly sound, the recommendations made by the Commissioner – although I feel she is a little overoptimistic – are certainly sound, but the important thing is for the legislation to be implemented, and so we need inspectors, we need monitoring, we need all possible endeavours to ensure that the directive is respected, even before we start to revise it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
