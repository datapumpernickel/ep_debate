<p class="contents">It seems to us important that we are promoting a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for that recuperation I mentioned, but it also seems to us very important that we roundly condemn the recurrence of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, because that is a worrying reminder of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where Western powers held responsibilities. It is therefore important that this condemnation be accompanied by a promotion of democratic and economic consolidation in Yugoslavia, with regard to which the European Union has much to do and much to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We very soon had him here before the House, as you all know, and we have naturally become aware, as he too is aware, of the dreadful legacy he has inherited, of the economic situation confronting Yugoslavia, and we hope, of course, that he will be able to surmount all these difficulties with our help.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is another point to be made: we must judge Yugoslavia by the same standards that we have applied to its neighbours and that we shall continue to apply to them. That is why we simply must ensure that the problems arising there are not simply settled with a nod and a wink or put on the back burner for possible consideration in the distant future but are resolved in an appropriate manner as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still political prisoners in Serbia today; they are actually the prisoners of Slobodan Milosevic. There is surely no reason at all why Milosevic's political prisoners of yesterday should be Kostunica's prisoners today. Sadly, Mr Kostunica missed his opportunity, on becoming President, to free these political prisoners – the Albanians in particular, but the Serbs too. He let the opportunity slip, but at least the Albanian political prisoners from Kosovo could have been released if he had handed them over to UNMIK in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In that way he would have been able to comply with Resolution 1244 and release them from Serbian prisons, and Dr Kouchner and his people would have had to take care of them. Now President Kostunica has tabled an amnesty law, but our House is not the only place where legislation takes time, and while the legislative wheels are turning down there, hundreds of young people – innocent young people – remain in custody. We expect this problem to be solved quickly. We also expect joint efforts to be made so that the many missing persons – Serbs and Albanians from Serbia and Kosovo – can soon be found; whether they are dead or alive, people want to know what has happened to them. That is the second problem.</p>
<p class="contents">And the last problem to which I wish to refer relates to the dreadful occurrences at the border between Serbia and Kosovo. The fact is that we have a confrontation there between two adversaries, neither of whom has any desire for peace. On the one side there is the Albanian UCK reserve, and on the other there is Slobodan Milosevic's secret service. Neither side wants peace, but we must help to ensure that peace is established in that region.</p>

In mid-January of this year, a few thousand Kosovars held a demonstration in front of the Brussels Council building and a delegation was received by the services of Mr Solana and the Portuguese Presidency. We were told that Mr Solana was understanding of these demands but it was also pointed out that – and I quote – the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to do business with a regime such as that of Milosevic.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Milosevic has now been replaced by Kostunica and I was in Kosovo when Kostunica received a very warm welcome at the Biarritz Summit, and was given several millions of EURO aid unconditionally. However, what has Kostunica done about the problem of prisoners in the meantime? It is true that by way of a symbolic gesture, one of the prisoners, Mrs Flora Brovina has been freed, but that cannot be the end of it, ladies and gentlemen. Our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. We demand a swift release of the political prisoners and an impartial inquiry into the whereabouts of the missing persons. Mr Solana, Mr Patten, I ask you both to put the Kostunica regime sufficiently under pressure to ensure these demands are met. I would like to say the following to Mr Kostunica: you would gain in credibility if you were to take advantage of the forthcoming Christmas celebrations to carry out such an act of goodwill, which can only benefit stability in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, all political prisoners in Serbia must be freed.</p>
<p class="contents">The injustices committed by Milosevic must now come to an end. It is worth repeating that we make the same requirements of the political leaders in Kosovo. The persecution of minorities can <span class="italic">never</span> be justified. The new political leadership in Serbia must act in such a way, and I would like to point this out, Mr President, so that the former president and dictator Milosevic, together with his partners in crime, can be brought before the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

For all our delight at the changes in Belgrade, we still have to press for the earliest possible release of these victims. This has nothing to do with an amnesty, because it stands to reason that an amnesty can only be granted to prisoners who have been justly convicted; what we are demanding is quite simply the release of unjustly convicted people. That may be linked with an amnesty, or their release may precede the amnesty. It is my view that the political prisoners, not least the many hundreds of Albanians, must be released without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appeal to President Kostunica to find out what happened to people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is a need to investigate the fate of those who were abducted, whether they were murdered or whether they are still being held somewhere. All those who are being illegally detained or who are in prison for political reasons must be released without delay. That is the first step towards the establishment of the rule of law. I do have to say that this is not much to ask in return for the substantial aid which the European Union has already pledged. We expect action as soon as the elections are over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the hugely important step of electing Kostunica, many other important steps need to be taken in future. That also includes an unequivocal return to the rule of law, democratic values and a sound handling of the legacy of the Milosevic regime. In order to establish truly lasting peace between the different groups, it is also necessary to shed light on the fate of the prisoners who have been imprisoned by Milosevic simply on the grounds of ethnicity or political views. We either expect a clear amnesty law in the short term with specific details or, and preferably in combination with, a concrete date for the release of the political prisoners. We believe that within Kosovo too, the mentality of ethnic groups which are still fighting each other should make way for mutual respect. The way in which Kosovar-Albanians are currently harassing Serbs on Serb territory is not helping to defuse the situation on either side. What we need now are concrete steps to reach lasting peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The request to President Kostunica to release all political prisoners from the Milosevic era, requires, as before, unrelenting diplomatic effort on the part of the European Council and Commission in Belgrade, especially since most Serb political prisoners, if not those of Albanian origin from Kosovo, have, as far as I know, now been released. An extremely harrowing detail in this respect is that many of these were taken hostage at the time the Yugoslav people’s army withdrew from Kosovo last year. I also agree with the request for help from KFOR to thwart further violence in the Presevo valley. This, evidently, is a case of imported Albanian aggression, as this part of Serbia had not experienced any acute ethnic tension in former days.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I noticed that the draft resolution does not cover the complex issue of the Kosovar Roma gypsies, unlike the draft resolution which was brought forward by the Liberal Group. The unscrupulous Milosevic regime has heavily compromised this entire population group in the eyes of the Albanian Kosovars. However, this fact does not in any way justify the dreadful reprisals on the Albanian side, such as the violent killing of four Ashani-Roma in mid-November when they returned to their burnt down homes, nor the burning alive of a fifteen-year-old Roma boy in Orahovac. Such serious crimes cast a cloud over Kosovo’s political future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure we are all pleased about the progress throughout the region in the course of this year, beginning with the electoral change in Croatia at the beginning of the year, continuing with the change in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and culminating in the extremely successful conference which was quite properly held in Zagreb a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">So much has changed since the autumn: the new authorities in Belgrade have moved fast, for example to restore international contacts; they have moved fast to enable the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take its place at the United Nations and, as well, to take its place in the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">Without blowing our own trumpet, we can also say that the European Union has responded very rapidly to the new situation. Our EUR 200m emergency package has been under way for the last month, delivering huge quantities of fuel and other urgent supplies like medicines and food, to help Serbia to get through the winter.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of political prisoners remains, however, as several members have pointed out, an extremely important one. The European Union has consistently raised the plight of Kosovar Albanians in prison in Serbia. I have done that myself. We have also raised the position of individuals like Flora Brovina and the very brave Serbian journalist Miroslav Filipovic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that there has been some progress. Brovina and Filipovic have both been freed. Indeed, I met Miroslav Filipovic when I was in Belgrade in October – we spent part of an evening together. I know that Members of this Parliament welcomed Flora Brovina to Brussels last month.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, many Kosovar Albanians remain in prison in Serbia and there remain many missing Kosovar Albanians and Serbs whom the ICRC is still attempting to trace. We have tried to display understanding for the new government as it seeks to consolidate democracy in Yugoslavia. But the issue of detainees is plainly extremely important. There has been some movement on the general issue. The Federal Government is working on a general amnesty, not just for Kosovar Albanian prisoners, but also for other political detainees. Contacts have been established. A special envoy of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ambassador Amneus, has been appointed and the ambassador has opened offices in Pristina and Gracanica.</p>
<p class="contents">I raised the issue of Kosovar Albanian prisoners with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities during my visit to Belgrade on 23 October and will continue to raise these issues with the Yugoslav Federal Republic authorities. I can assure honourable Members that it is an issue which I will take up – not least as a result of this debate – on the next visit I make to Belgrade after the elections on 23 December.</p>
<p class="contents">I share honourable Members' concern about the situation in the Presevo valley. We strongly condemn recent violence. The attacks are attacks on democracy: the new democracy in Serbia and the prospects of democracy in Kosovo. I welcome steps now taken by KFOR to tackle the problem and continue to urge restraint on all sides. The Community is, of course, playing its role, for example, by ensuring that the Presevo valley benefits from our assistance programmes for Serbia. We are running three schools for democracy projects in the area and we are looking to help with fuel supplies in the area as well. But, I repeat, we know how important this issue is; it is an issue that we have raised consistently in the past and we will continue to raise it with the new authorities in Belgrade with, I hope, happier consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
