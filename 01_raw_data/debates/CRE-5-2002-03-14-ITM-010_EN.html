This was to be expected. No effort has been spared to achieve this result, although the majority was smaller than anticipated. Nevertheless, I see this as a moral victory for the opposition, which itself uses the term ‘stolen elections’.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the stolen elections in Chad and the rigged elections in Zambia, this is the third round of elections which, with the best will in the world, cannot be considered free and fair according to international standards, no matter how moderate a view some other African countries, for reasons probably known only to themselves, still take. After all, the writing was on the wall: 4.5 million voters expected and 7.5 million ballots printed so as to be prepared for every eventuality; too few polling stations to enable everyone to vote properly; and the inevitable confusion about who had to vote where, since different elections needed to be held for different levels on the same day but at different locations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are only the technicalities which typify Mr Mugabe’s craftiness. More important was the terror which preceded this, the obstructions put in place by the ruling elite in order to prevent the opposition from meeting, the monopoly of the state channels, the prevention of journalists from doing their job, the obstacles placed in the way of observers, the incidents of torture and the abductions, including even the abduction of important union leaders. The list goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the ploy involving the distribution of corn, far away from the polling stations, was predicted by the opposition. The performance about re-opening the polling stations was the icing on the cake, and yet we need to ask ourselves: what now?</p>
<p class="contents">The elections were not conducted freely and fairly, but do we need to condemn them altogether? The elections in Zambia and Chad were not free and fair either. However, we do need to maintain the sanctions. I am not in favour of extending these, but they do need to be applied and monitored. I do call for negotiations between the members of the majority and the opposition, for the country is anxious about a civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that a government of national unity, involving the opposition, will be set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elections in Zimbabwe were an incredible farce, even by African standards. Mr Mugabe made every effort to stay in power, using extremely brutal means. Nothing was too extreme for the purpose of eliminating his opponents: violence, intimidation, murder, large-scale arrests and accusations of high treason. Election laws were changed at the last minute. There were selectively too few ballot stations, identity cards were seized, the media was not allowed to do its job and the observation of the elections was a joke. Politically blind South African observers made absolute fools of themselves by declaring that the elections had been conducted fairly and freely.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe wants – by hook or by crook – to pursue his ill-fated policy which has led Zimbabwe to the brink of starvation, where 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line and 60% are unemployed. Tougher sanctions must be used in order even further to isolate Mugabe internationally. We should not punish the population for the wrong-doings of its leader. What is the scope for tougher sanctions, according to the Commissioner? What will the Commission propose to the European Council in Barcelona?</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, democracy in Africa often leaves a great deal to be desired. African solidarity with the dictator Mugabe is sadly a very bad omen. This is why we must focus our political efforts not only on Zimbabwe, but also on the other countries in that region. South Africa receives a great deal of aid from Europe but is unconcerned about the justified criticism levelled at its neighbour. I pity Africa, I pity the population that has to suffer so much at the hands of incompetent, power-crazed and corrupt leaders. When will we finally have a generation of democratic leaders in Africa? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can still remember electoral victories claimed by presidents who were very soon overtaken, and were very soon presidents no more. I do not wish to draw any direct parallels, but it seems to me that he should not be too quick to celebrate his victory over his opponents. Especially as the elections were held under the worst possible conditions, with intimidation, police action against members and supporters of the opposition and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">What saddens me is not just the situation in Zimbabwe itself, but the fact that numerous African Heads of State and Government and President Mugabe are indirectly providing a shield, even as they acknowledge his election victory. Perhaps this hides the fear of more neo-colonialism on the part of Europe or the United States of America and other countries. That certain parties may be entertaining such thoughts is, of course, no concern of ours. It may be the case, but it is not the policy of the European Union. What concerns us is the people who are starving there, who are suffering repression there. A few days ago, I was on a jury which awarded a prize to the Nobel prize-winner Amartya Sen. This man has stated time and again that democracy and development go hand in glove and cannot be separated. Which is why I think that the European Union should do everything it can to create democracy and the conditions for economic development here too.</p>
<p class="contents">We, by which I mean everyone from the European Union due to attend the session of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Cape Town, shall no doubt be addressing these concerns. Most importantly, we must call on South Africa to do proper justice to its hugely important role in southern Africa. Unfortunately, we shall also have to step up sanctions, despite the economic difficulties. But, and I say it again, if his African neighbours were to work with the European Union in taking against this dictatorship, success would come quickly and we could really help the people in this sorely afflicted country.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in this seriously flawed presidential election, we have good grounds for believing that Mugabe in reality lost the vote, but merely contrived to win the count. He will now be able to have his foot on the neck of the Zimbabwean people for another six years. It represents a new low for democracy in Zimbabwe and a disaster not just for Zimbabwe, but for the whole of Southern Africa. Mugabe personifies all the most negative strains in African development: corrupt and authoritarian power with state leaders lining their pockets at the expense of the people, racial division, the exploitation of envy, political violence and economic backwardness.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is a beautiful and once prosperous country with the potential to be the bread basket for the region. Instead, the economy is in chaos, with rampant inflation and unemployment and half a million of its people living on the edge of starvation, sustained only by world food aid. Mugabe's re-election will seriously exacerbate all of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that Mugabe realised that his game might be up some two years ago, ZANU-PF came close to losing the general election; and that is why for the past two years – not just the past two weeks – he has been trying to fix the political system in his favour by a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against anyone who opposed him. This Parliament should pay tribute to Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC activists and all those who have had the courage to stand up to Mugabe for all this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say it is a pity that the international community took so long to wake up to the situation in Zimbabwe and that the European Union waited until the eleventh hour before imposing targeted sanctions. At least we in this Parliament can hold our heads up. We have been active throughout the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of African countries has been particularly disappointing. We always felt that South Africa, in particular, held the key to restoring genuine democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. However, South Africa's leaders were found wanting. They could not find it in their consciences to condemn what they perhaps saw as one of their liberation brothers. What a pity for the people of Zimbabwe – all the people of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">At least the Southern African Development Community election observer mission has felt able to recognise in its announcement yesterday that: 'the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region'. What they mean, I think, Mr President, is that the election was clearly rigged. Certainly, that is the opinion of the few other international observers that remained. How else do we explain, for instance, the bizarre declaration that turnout in the city areas loyal to Tsvangirai was low, while in the ZANU-PF rural strongholds, it was remarkably high? How else do we explain the missing ballot boxes which suddenly turn up stuffed up with Mugabe votes?</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must maintain its resolve. It must not recognise the legitimacy of this election result. There must be an intensification of the hunt for looted assets held overseas by Mugabe and his cronies. There should be an extension of the EU blacklist, and we need to take further tough measures. South Africa must begin to show leadership and demonstrate that it is committed to democratic principles in the region. Our aim must be to help restore democracy, human rights and the rule of law to Zimbabwe and assist in the process of economic progress there. Our tough resolution today is a contribution to this, and I hope the Council and the Commission will listen to us.</p>

The opposition’s election workers have been threatened, persecuted, imprisoned and killed. Freedom of expression is non-existent. Many Zimbabweans queued for hours and were still not allowed to vote. Mr Mugabe has broken promise after promise and driven his country into the ground. Under his leadership, Zimbabwe, a country with fantastic potential, has headed straight for the abyss.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worrying that so many African leaders have tried to explain away what has been happening in Zimbabwe and maintained that the elections were fair. I assume that the Foreign Ministers and the Commission will discuss Zimbabwe in Barcelona and decide upon suitable, wider sanctions and a strategy to involve the whole region. A lot of pressure must be exerted upon South Africa. In no way can we recognise these elections as fair.</p>
<p class="contents">We waited far too long before taking action against Zimbabwe. We hoped and believed. Our former colleague, Mr Schori, had to be thrown out of the country before the sanctions were introduced.

In my country, the Netherlands, 1 April is often associated with jokes. If only that applied to the people of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, the extension of Mugabe’s term of office is a bitter reality. It is based on the official result of last weekend’s extended presidential elections, which was published yesterday. The run-up to, as well as the course of, these elections is captured neatly in Zimbabwe as ‘flee and fear elections’.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, these Zimbabwean presidential elections were neither free nor fair. The mere fact that many ballot stations are used as torture centres at night, where Mugabe’s uninhibited militia torture and humiliate political opponents, speaks volumes. This abhorrent fact marks out the sinister context of Mugabe’s ruthless campaign to stay in power.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely understandable why Mugabe’s main rival, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, has rejected the election result as nothing but voter deception. In this extremely difficult situation, what Tsvangirai’s party, <span class="italic">the Movement for Democratic Change</span>, needs most of all is level-headedness and wisdom. He is reportedly looking for legal means to fight and revoke the official election result. Tsvangirai and his men are certainly not seeking confrontation, according to their own sources. Given the desolate political and socio-economic situation to which Mugabe’s thirst for power has led Zimbabwe, this attitude on the part of the Zimbabwean opposition deserves the support of the Council and the Commission. For an escalation into civil war will suck the country deeper into the quagmire.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I would urge the Council and the Commission to join forces with the US administration in order to give Mugabe’s regime an even stronger international warning. At the same time, we must consider how we can continue to bolster the constructive forces in Zimbabwe. Those Western reactions to Mugabe’s disputable re-election which I have noted to date elicit this expectation. This is so unlike some African opinions which claim the elections to be ‘free and fair on the whole’. If this is truly the regional, political benchmark, then southern Africa is directly on course for instability. Consequently, a European appeal to the South African authorities, in particular, is just as much called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has been observing events in Zimbabwe with growing concern. Misgivings about the electoral process which the European Union voiced when Article 96 still applied have proven to be wholly justified. I expect the Heads of Government will discuss this issue in Barcelona and that the European Union will be quick to make a statement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the election observers have come to the conclusion that the elections did not reflect the will of people of Zimbabwe and list a whole range of shortcomings in the election process. However, we can emphasise that, however disappointing the outcome of these elections, the main point is that the international community has turned its attention to Zimbabwe and is doing everything it can to contain the crisis there.</p>
<p class="contents">A broad show of force would have serious, mainly regional repercussions. In the short term, South Africa would face a refugee crisis and, in the long term, any such crisis might jeopardise regional prospects for economic growth and sustainable development, all against a backdrop of a serious food shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, together with other partners, will be giving humanitarian requirements a high priority. It is also extremely important for us to work with the SADC governments and the ACP countries in order to find a common basis for overcoming the crisis in Zimbabwe. The European Union is planning to send a high-level troika in the near future, to discuss our misgivings about Zimbabwe with our SADC partners on the basis of our common commitment to the rule of law and democracy. I trust that the European Parliament will be able to play an important role here.</p>

We have long hoped that, even with a Communist regime, this country would stick to economic development and the road towards the European Union. That hope has now been dashed and the Communist government knew that it was playing with fire when it introduced the Russian language and made it compulsory to teach a Stalinist slant on history. Language and culture have already sparked one military conflict in this country, which was only quelled within a few days thanks to a broad social compromise, with stability being established in the country through long-term action by the OSCE. The government has now destroyed all that, and in one of the poorest countries in Europe. I think it is wrong that the government is now trying to keep dragging out excuses. We have seen this over the last few days, with the government maintaining that others are responsible for the political crisis. It is responsible because it has tried to revoke this compromise, in one of the poorest countries in Europe. If this country now falls into political crisis, just when it is on the verge of becoming a neighbouring country, it will also affect us, which is why I think the government urgently needs to give in, reverse these decisions and do something about creating economic and political stability in this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everything that Mrs Schröder said is true. We have before us a very difficult situation which could lead to developments similar to those in Belarus. We must be clear-sighted and see that it is Vladimir Voranin who has stopped economic reforms. These events have led to a suspension of funding from the international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the means used to turn Moldova eastwards and to create problems with Romania. For instance the Moldovan Government refused to allow the people to set up an Orthodox community attached to the Romanian Orthodox Church. This has been condemned as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. Transdniestria does not need mentioning further; we know about it and the present attitude of the government is not helping to solve the problem there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Democrat party has been mentioned. What has been said over the last few days in the Russian Duma, which has accused Romania of interference, is worrying. What has been said in the Russian Duma is not accurate. We now have a situation where a Romanian diplomat has been declared persona non grata. This is creating a good deal of tension.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission need to focus much more on Moldova for the reasons mentioned by Mrs Schröder. We must avoid being confronted with a new Belarus.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>When, after the elections a year ago, a Communist government took up office in Moldavia, it was, of course, only a matter of time before that country was the subject of discussion in this Parliament, and that day has now come. I would have preferred us to use our direct contacts with the parliament in order to raise a few issues which would possibly be the topics of debate at a later date, but I understand that some groups want to discuss this today. It seems like a good idea to me. It is important for the European Union to devote more attention to what is already considered Europe’s poorest country. A country riddled with problems, not only political problems, but also major social problems including those involving poverty, health care and the care of seriously disadvantaged children. Precisely in a situation of this kind, it is, of course, very frustrating that it is the government that should be encouraging these contradictions in a country that is, in fact, disoriented, that is unable to choose between the East and the West, a country that is rather divided.</p>
<p class="contents">What struck me was that the recent protests were not only against the government but also mainly in favour of Europe, and this shows how the contradictions are evolving in that country. In my view, the government has made a huge mistake by presenting controversial proposals which, precisely in the areas of language and the teaching of history, have caused a great stir. Fortunately, the government has since realised that things are not that simple and has retracted a number of these measures, partly under pressure from the loud protest from outside Moldavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, too, we must stress that the government should realise that it should stop interfering with, and sabotaging, the opposition. A warning has been issued about lifting the immunity of certain politicians. This is not acceptable, in my view. The opposition must be left alone, reflecting the dignified manner in which the opposition protested against the government measures. What should be avoided at all costs in that country is a situation in which one group tries to force the other in a certain direction, either the direction of Russia or that of Europe. This is something on which the people themselves must be able to decide in their own time and in a democratic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I already mentioned that this debate is also an opportunity to say that the European Union should do more. I have understood that the Commission is looking into the possibility of granting more direct aid to the people in the country itself. By aid, I mean health care, social development and such like. In my view, we can, above all, ask the government and all the people in Moldavia to create a situation in that country in which the international community can operate more effectively, for we are often very hampered in what we want to do there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important in my opinion to urge the countries in that region to contribute to Moldova’s stability and to help find a solution to the problem involving Transdniestria, for that is also a heavy burden resting on Moldova. It is an issue on which Romania and Russia should exercise restraint, in my view, but to which the European Union in particular, together with the OSCE, should look to find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That alone shows just how important this tiny country is for us in the European Union, quite apart from the fact, as Mrs Schroedter rightly pointed out, that it will border on the European Union once Romania accedes and, hopefully, will itself one day become part of the European Union. Nor should we forget why Moldavia went down the terrible road which it has had to endure over the last few decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldavia was the victim of the Hitler/Stalin pact and, for decades afterwards, it was plundered as a European outpost of the Soviet Union. With such a history, Moldavia does not have the strength to get back on its own feet and, as one speaker rightly said, what we have here is a very dangerous crisis waiting to happen. On one side, Russia is directly involved via Transdniestria or the so-called Dniester Republic which, from Russia's point of view, is a sort of advance guard of nationalistic and militaristic circles in Europe while, on the other side, it has cultural and historic links with Romania, and it will become a dangerous bone of contention between an EU candidate country on one side and the European Union's most powerful neighbour on the other, unless we do everything we can to stabilise this country, by which I mean we must stand up for human rights, for the rights of our Christian democrat and other counterparts in the Moldavian Parliament who are under attack, we must stand up against neo-colonialist efforts to bring this country under control through language and by rewriting history and we must stand up for democracy and the rule of law. I also think, Commissioner, that we should be more active than we have been in the past in helping with institution building, with establishing democratic institutions in this country. It is in our interest to exert a stabilising influence here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcome this resolution by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldavia is the poorest country in Europe and is still no closer to resolving its conflict with the rebel region of Transdnistria. The Moldavian Government has refused to meet representatives of Transdnistria since last summer and a bitter fight is waging over border controls in which Ukraine has also been caught up. An uneasy air of confrontation has recently arisen between the Communist Government of the Republic of Moldavia and the Romanian-speaking nationalists. The reform process is suffering from constant setbacks and the IMF has refused to grant any more loans. In the meantime, there are also worrying indications that the government is looking to Russia to resolve its problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reasons for the country's poverty are of a political nature. The failure to resolve the Transdnistrian conflict is having a particularly serious impact. The European Union is currently examining how it can support OSCE efforts to improve the situation. We have set up a relatively generous aid programme. A provisional sum of around EUR 40 million has been set aside to support this country over the next two years with technical assistance, food aid and special macro-economic financial aid. However, we need a guarantee that Moldavia will also make an effort to put its finances on a more viable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that ECHO has pulled out of Moldavia because ECHO's job is to provide emergency aid, not resolve structural problems. But even if ECHO's work can be continued using other instruments, such as TACIS, we must not forget that aid alone will not resolve political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission is willing and able to see what measures can be taken with the means available to help resolve the Transdnistrian conflict.</p>

There is an enormous abuse of power by the government, and people are thrown into prison at random under false accusations to eliminate political opponents.

<p class="contents">Despite this, there are people who, with great courage, try to uphold democracy in their country, despite major personal risks, as Mr Beknazarov found out. Democratically elected people, journalists and citizens who uphold the rule of law are oppressed and even subjected to torture. But they should know that the European Union is on their side on this. We must apply pressure on the government. We have, in the framework of the partnership and the cooperation agreement, the chance to pressurise the government into engaging in dialogue with the opposition, ending the torture and ensuring that the country is on track to becoming one in which the rule of law applies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is certainly true today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been to Kyrgyzstan several times in recent years, as it emerged from those dark days of the Soviet empire and set the pace for the region in terms of political, economic and health reforms. I paid tribute then, as I have done since, to those periods of progress. But in the last couple of years we have become worried about progress in that country. President Akayev, who came from a background of the Academy of Sciences, was elected in a free vote in 1991 and re-elected in 1995, has subsequently become more of an oppressive president than a democratic one. Both parliamentary and presidential elections in 2000 sadly highlighted the flawed nature of the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">We were concerned about candidates being banned on technicalities not least because of their knowledge of the Kyrgyz language; about the press being suppressed and repressed; about community groups being prevented from playing their part in the process. Symbolic of all this has been the arrest of Azimbek Beknazarov, chairman of the parliamentary committee on judicial and legal reforms. He was arrested in January and brought to trial in February. The trial was then postponed until this month.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a country with many problems within its borders, including a lack of natural resources, racial tensions and incursions from abroad. Eighty-eight per cent of its population lives on an income of under USD 4 a day. It does not need the opprobrium that will come from world opinion if it makes a mess of its democratic processes, its independent judiciary and its freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we move this motion today, asking them to listen. We will be watching for results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time is short, so I shall address what seem to me to be two particularly important points. First, when I visited the region, I saw clearly for myself that the people were raring to go and move towards our values. Unlike all the countries which have since joined and will soon join the EU, the countries of central Asia are basically making their own way towards democracy, without the huge amounts in aid being received by other countries. The only aid is TACIS. The European Union is providing Kyrgyzstan with financial and technical assistance in setting up ministries in the agricultural and social sectors. If you just stop to consider the different mentality, the cultural differences, religious differences and their completely different historical development, then you will begin to understand the huge difference between our and the central Asian understanding of democracy. What I mean to say here is that we must be careful not to be too harsh on other countries in our demands for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as partners and friends of central Asia, it is our duty to point out serious scandals in due and proper form, especially as Kyrgyzstan is in receipt of a certain amount of aid from us under the TACIS programme. This European Parliament resolution takes account of the dilemma to which I referred. As I said, on the one hand, a recognition of what are surely difficult circumstances and, on the other, the difficulty in establishing a working democracy which guarantees the involvement of all sections and groups of the population. I should like to make a point of acknowledging what has been achieved so far. However, when it comes to human rights, as Mr Bowis very impressively pointed out, there appears to be more retrogression than progression and I must express my very serious concern here. Human rights and human dignity are the basis of a modern society and a stable democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission does not want to interfere in the legal affairs of a sovereign state, but the overkill on the part of the Kyrgyz authorities in the Beknazarov case is particularly worrying. It includes isolation and possibly maltreatment of Mr Beknazarov on grounds which appear to boil down to professional misjudgment on his part or perhaps to professional misconduct seven years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proceedings against Mr Beknazarov have unleashed general disapproval among the people and could seriously undermine the credibility of the government and, in the end, the stability of the country. The Commission is also alarmed by the fact that the Beknazarov case appears to be just one in an increasingly long line of judicial proceedings against the government's political opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Parliament that Kyrgyzstan has put its good reputation on the line over the last two years. The Commission has never failed, nor will it fail this time to stress just how much importance it attaches to Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement requiring contracting parties to promise to respect democracy, the principles of international law and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes the infringements appear to pass unnoticed. The opposition is persecuted, there are at least a thousand political prisoners in jail, freedom of expression is minimal and freedom of assembly is restricted. Journalists and workers for democracy are harassed, and lawyers are not permitted to work.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Tunisian human rights campaigners have been nominated for the Sacharov Prize, and we have criticised Tunisia on several occasions in this House. Now, there is cause to do so again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the proceedings against Hamma Hammami and his colleagues in the banned Communist Party. Their trial is a farce, and the way it is being conducted completely unacceptable. There have been protests from all around the world. Even in my own country, where Tunisia is rarely mentioned, there have been a number of indignant press articles in the last few days about the way in which the members of the Tunisian Communist Party are being treated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hammami, Mr Madouri and Mr Taamallah decided of their own accord to come forward and stand trial. Subsequent developments have been alarming and very far from being in accordance with the principles of a constitutional state. The three have been maltreated, they are not allowed to see their lawyers, and the trial itself is one big legal farce.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed that they are prisoners of conscience who must be treated decently and in a manner appropriate to a constitutional state. The trial is to begin again on 30 March and, until then, they should be set free. Because they themselves have given themselves up, that is only right. We must send a message to Tunisia to the effect that we are keeping an eye on the country and watching the trial, which we shall be following extremely closely.</p>

We make tough demands on ourselves and on the candidate countries, but almost no such demands upon Tunisia.</p>

We now believe, however, that these undertakings, which were reiterated at the Association Council session of 29 January, have been flouted by the way in which Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants are being treated by the Tunisian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The defendants, who voluntarily came out of hiding, a state in which they were forced to live following their infamous trials in 1997 and 1998, were again convicted on 2 February before the Court of First Instance and their sentence was confirmed in a farcical judicial hearing which, unfortunately, confirms the serious defects in the rule of law that has been in force in Tunisia for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">Two hundred lawyers gathered in support of the defence. They were set upon by the police and the prisoners were violently assaulted. Hamma Hammami began a hunger strike on 26 February to protest against the conditions in which he is being detained. He was moved to the area in Tunis prison that is reserved for those sentenced to death, despite the fact that he is a political prisoner. This situation is in breach of the Treaties, particularly Article 2 of the Association Agreement with the European Union on the respect of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now crucial that, a few weeks before the start of the Conference on Foreign Affairs (Barcelona V), which is being held in Valencia on 22 and 23 April, we, as Members of the European Parliament, call upon the Tunisian authorities to release Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants. This is a first step which is essential for the respect of the rule of law in Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to demand that the Tunis authorities comply with international law and to instruct its parliamentary delegation to raise this subject more firmly with the Tunisian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last month, after the defendants surrendered to the authorities, those sentences were confirmed in less than one minute without a presentation of evidence by the prosecution or defence or an examination of the witnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also accusations of widespread abuses by the government against other dissident groups. Democracy and the rule of law are attributes enjoyed until recently by few countries even in Europe. They take time to evolve and can appear fragile in the face of threats.</p>
<p class="contents">In states such as Tunisia, it may seem an achievement merely to resist the kind of radical socialism or Islamicism that has blighted the lives of so many in the Arab world in recent decades. We ourselves have to be careful, when we urge greater pluralism and respect for democratic norms around the world, that we do not undermine governments which, however imperfect, are moving in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the EU has an important role to play in helping to provide an example for countries which want to move away from a spiral of poverty, extremism and repression. Nor can we entirely isolate ourselves from the problems experienced by neighbouring countries such as Tunisia. By encouraging economic and political reform together with foreign direct investment, and with respect for good government, democracy and human rights, we help others and we also help ourselves, by reducing not only the resentment often felt against the West in the Arab world, but also the migratory pressures that are generating serious problems in our own societies and which themselves require urgent solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, it is right for the French Government to highlight the importance of giving aid to the Maghreb countries, many of whose citizens are settled in London, which I represent, as migrants or refugees. It is also right to begin to open EU markets, including our agricultural markets, to poorer countries that wish to trade with us, in ways that benefit them more directly and prevent future migratory pressures by the long-term stabilisation of their own economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zrihen (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, convicted in absentia in 1999 to nine years and three months in prison for membership of an illegal association, incitement to civil disobedience, distribution of pamphlets inciting violence and dishonestly spreading false information liable to disrupt public order, Hamma Hammami came out of hiding in order to challenge this judgment on 2 February 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of an eventful trial punctuated with incidents, the Court of First Instance in Tunis confirmed the original verdict and ordered the accused Hamma Hammami to be imprisoned. The appeal trial began on Saturday 9 March before a number of foreign observers, including journalists, Western diplomats posted to Tunis, barristers from France, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as delegates from human rights organisations. A dozen lawyers appealed, one after the other, to the bar to request to be given time to read through the dossier that they had been unable to access and to deplore the fact that they had been prevented from visiting their client as under normal circumstances. After some deliberation, the Court of Appeal postponed the trial until 30 March and refused the request to release the accused men. These are the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has expressed to the Tunisian authorities its concern regarding the human rights violations, but has merely hinted at the fact that these violations may compromise its Association Agreement with Tunisia, which was the first bilateral pact between the European Union and a Mediterranean country and which was signed three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Last January, Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, met with the Tunisian authorities in Tunis whilst on an official visit to North Africa. In a speech that he gave on that occasion, Mr Prodi stated that the negotiations related to trade and cooperation. Instead of taking this opportunity, whilst speaking publicly, to raise the issue of human rights, Mr Prodi welcomed the economic reforms undertaken in Tunisia. He stressed that the European Union respects the political sovereignty of Tunisia and does not wish to interfere in Tunisia’s internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at a meeting held in June in Tunis with President Ben Ali and the Prime Minister, Mohammed Ganouch, the European Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, paid more attention to the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 December 2000, the European Parliament adopted a resolution engaging the European institutions to use all the means provided for by the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights and, whereas the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement lays down the promotion of human rights as a key element, it regrets the fact that this frank and open dialogue had not sufficed to encourage the Tunisian authorities to advance along the path of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I ask you to ensure that this resolution be forwarded to the Council and to the Commission and to the Tunisian Government and parliament for its information, and that we stress that we will follow events closely in the run-up to 30 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After four years of living in hiding, the three activists decided to appear freely before the court in order to challenge their sentence in a court of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The trial of 2 February, as other Members have said, was a sham. The defendants were seized from their seats, taken away by the police during the court proceedings, and swiftly condemned to harsh prison sentences – Hamma Hammami was sentenced to nine years and three months. These men were not given the chance to defend themselves and were not given access to their lawyers. All this happened before a number of Tunisian and foreign observers and protesters. They are being detained in a civilian prison in disgraceful conditions. This trial is a real parody of justice. In response to this situation, the Tunisian Lawyers Council declared a strike. Hamma Hammami and Abdel Jabarmadouri decided to go on hunger strike in protest at their conditions of detention and to demand that their lawyers be given the right of visit.</p>
<p class="contents">These events are part of a continuing campaign of intimidation and repression, which targets political opponents, human rights protesters, journalists, trade unionists, students, lawyers and magistrates. We note that the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, stipulating that relations between the two parties are based on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, has once again been flouted.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask for an exceptional meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council to be organised as soon as possible to tackle the issue of human rights. Parliament must demand the release of Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants, and that Article 2 of the Agreement be respected. The Council and the Commission must use all the means provided for by the agreement in order to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights in Tunisia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, we cannot overlook and we are deeply saddened by the repeated violation of human rights in Tunisia, the most recent case being the sentence passed on Hamma Hammami and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">These human rights violations were really not necessary, not in a country like Tunisia. The type of trial, the procedures surrounding the trial and the argument which Tunisia keeps on using, that democracy is being established, that slow progress is being made is, more is the pity, just not true. Or the steps, the progress being made, is so small as to be indiscernible. I therefore take the view that the current agreement should also be used for dialogue on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see this sort of agreement as a futile endeavour; on the contrary, agreements such as these with countries such as Tunisia give us the opportunity to ensure that the human rights issue is a subject of serious dialogue. I also take the view that human rights organisations, non-governmental organisations, should be more closely involved in the European Union's support instruments, especially as far as the MEDA Democracy programme is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said before both on several occasions in this House and in conversation with Tunisian colleagues, and I shall say it again: the important and legitimate fight against fundamentalism and, more importantly, against potential terrorism, cannot be fought, let alone won if it is paid for by violating human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights violations will not give the country greater security; on the contrary, all they will do is jeopardise the security of the country in the long term, and that is something which neither we nor Tunisia wants. I therefore call once again on Tunisia to start practising its professed faith in human rights at long last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 9 March this year, a representative of the EU presidency attended the court hearing as an observer. The Foreign Ministry was notified of his attendance in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the postponement of the trial to 30 March to give the defence more time to prepare its case. The Commission shall continue to follow developments at the trial very closely through its delegation in Tunis. The EU is taking every opportunity to strengthen the human rights dialogue with Tunisia. At the most recent meeting of the association council on 29 January this year it expressly urged the Tunisian authorities to step up their efforts towards pluralism, democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
