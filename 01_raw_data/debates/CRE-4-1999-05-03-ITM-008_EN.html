<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fayot </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, as this is the last report to be drawn up by the now defunct Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, I should like to say a few words. I should also naturally like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, especially all those who have been members of this committee for a long time and in this respect, special mention must of course be made of Mr Wijsenbeek. I should also like to thank the committee"s secretariat for the excellent work it has continuously carried out to ensure that the Rules of Procedure meet the needs of Parliament"s work.</p>
<p class="contents">From the next parliamentary term, the work of this Committee, of this defunct Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, will be divided between the two larger committees of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights and the Committee on Institutional Affairs. In other words, the work it has carried out is clearly of some considerable importance as from now on it will be dealt with by two committees of greater standing.</p>
<p class="contents">The present report, Mr President, centres on Annex V of the Rules of Procedure and, in particular, the discharge procedure. You will be aware that it was a letter from Mrs Theato, the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that prompted the committee to consider Annex V. The letter inquired as to whether Article 5 of Annex V, which states that an absolute majority must refuse discharge, complied with the provisions of the Treaty. Last December we had lengthy discussions on the matter as well as on the issue of whether or not the proposal for a decision could be amended. At that time we adopted an interpretation, which was also adopted in the House, and also stated our intention to reconsider the whole of Annex V.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we have done within the framework of this report and I should like to point out that it is the result of close collaboration with the Committee on Budgetary Control. I should particularly like to thank its chairman, Mrs Theato, who unfortunately cannot be with us today. I should also of course like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the committee, Mrs Kjer Hansen, and all the members of the committee, who did some excellent work, because this directly involved the way in which their procedures are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Many amendments were tabled to my draft report, although all of them were along the same lines. There was no fundamental disagreement as to which procedure to adopt. The key point was to do away with Article 5 and the absolute majority, to put the refusal to grant discharge on an equal footing with the granting of discharge, and to set out the procedure to be followed in cases where the decision was postponed. I should therefore like to highlight the fact that the new Article 3, the procedure for refusing or granting discharge, is the subject of three proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there is a proposal for a decision concerning the granting or refusal of discharge by, of course, a simple majority. There is a second proposal for a decision that provides for the closure of accounts. This is an important new element which would allow us to separate, on the one hand, the closure of accounts – a type of simple technical procedure, if you like, to check whether the accounts have been kept as they should – and on the other hand, the discussion or opinion of Parliament on the Commission"s management of the budget. Lastly, there is a third proposal, a motion for a resolution, in which Parliament sets out its observations regarding the Commission"s budgetary management. Only this motion for a resolution can be amended, according to the Rules of Procedure, if it is accepted by the House, as we are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have also set out a very specific procedure to be followed in the event of the decision being postponed, in order to highlight the need to develop the procedure further rather than simply leaving it as it is. A final article provides for its consideration by the House. The two amendments that have been tabled do not therefore significantly change the as set out by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, and, as a result, they do not alter the general philosophy behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that this new annex will facilitate the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament. In my view, relations between Parliament and the Commission as regards budgetary management will be developed and enhanced as a consequence and I hope that the new Rules of Procedure will further enhance Parliament"s work in monitoring the Commission"s budgetary management.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MRS SCHLEICHER<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corbett </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Fayot on not just his report but also his chairmanship of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities over these last few years. It has been a truly excellent chairmanship.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reassure him that the committee is not being taken over by the Committee on Institutional Affairs: it is merging with that committee to create a new constitutional committee, which will be a very important committee in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue we have before us arises because the Treaties themselves are not clear on what should happen if Parliament does not give discharge. We ourselves, as a parliament, interpreted the right to give discharge to mean that we also had a right to refuse discharge. That interpretation is shared by the other institutions and has been the practice for a number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Treaty is silent on what should happen if Parliament refuses discharge. We as a parliament for many years interpreted the situation to be such that if Parliament were to refuse discharge, then the Commission concerned, if it was still in office, should take the necessary consequences and resign – it should have to go. In other words, refusal of discharge was tantamount in itself to a sort of motion of censure on the Commission. The Commission itself, through Commissioner Tugendhat, when he was budget Commissioner, appeared to accept that interpretation. That is why we have put in Annex V of our Rules that we needed not just a simple majority but also a special majority of Members of the House – an absolute majority – to refuse discharge, because otherwise the refusal of discharge could have been a backdoor way to censure the Commission by a smaller majority than that normally required under the Treaty. It was therefore to protect the Treaty that we put this special majority requirement in our Rules.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, however, was undermined by the events of last December, when some Members of this House – some Groups indeed – wished to refuse discharge but keep the Commission. That was contradictory, and Parliament was obliged to address the issue through a separate motion of censure on the Commission, thereby destroying the direct link between refusal of discharge and the consequence of the departure of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem appeared in that at that time there was probably neither a majority in the House to grant discharge nor an absolute majority to refuse discharge, and Parliament was therefore a prisoner between these two differing majority requirements in its Rules of Procedure. It is for that reason that it was necessary then to review the Rules. The Rules Committee has done that; we have based ourselves largely on the opinion given by the Committee on Budgetary Control. Where we have not done that, my Group has tabled two amendments which will rectify that situation and, indeed, get rid of a contradiction which we believe exists in the report at present. This will therefore revert us to a simple majority both to grant and to refuse discharge. The consequence though is that refusal to grant discharge from now on is simply a reprimand on the Commission, not a way of censuring the Commission. If Parliament were to refuse discharge, it would then have to debate separately what the consequences should be if the Commission itself did not draw any consequences.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, the Rules of Procedure are intended to enable decisions on issues of substance to be made and if possible to make this process easier, not to make it more difficult or even obstruct it. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case, and both the chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr Fayot, and Mr Corbett specifically referred just now to the particular circumstances in this instance. We remember that in the 1996 discharge procedure, inconsistencies and provisions which were contrary to the Treaty came to light; this was because Annex V laid down a larger majority for not granting discharge than the Treaty itself prescribes in Article 141 of the EC Treaty. That was the main problem! Mr Corbett has in fact pointed out that there was support in Parliament for making something more of this relatively clear provision in the Treaty than it actually stated and still does state. That also contributed to the problems we experienced during the 1996 discharge which have already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this situation, the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, acting on the instructions of the committee, made a request in this House on 15 January 1999 for the Rules Committee to clarify precisely what the Treaty itself provides for, that is to say for the direct link between refusal of discharge and a possible censure procedure to be removed. That has now happened. We ought – and here I fully agree with Mr Corbett – to thank very much the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, Mr Fayot, for dealing with the matter brought to his committee by the Committee on Budgetary Control very swiftly and for being so willing to cooperate. We should also like to thank Mr Fayot for his work in the committee as a whole, and the fact that this committee will cease to exist in its current form – and this is the final point on which I agree with Mr Corbett – should not be seen as reflecting an unfavourable assessment of the work of the committee and especially not the work of its chairman; this is actually happening because in future we want important matters which relate to each other to be dealt with together. Seen in this light, a considerable amount of the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control will be in good hands in the future Constitutional Affairs Committee.</p>

That question is one to be dealt with under the Treaty, but we are getting some clear internal guidelines about what procedures we can use in Parliament. I am pleased that we shall no longer spend hours and hours discussing the procedural options, but are now getting some clear rules. I would therefore like to thank my colleagues, and especially Mr Fayot, for their very constructive cooperation in connection with the amendment of the Rules of Procedure, and I would especially like to express my gratitude for the understanding and sympathy shown to the views I have presented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we now have agreement between the Rules of Procedure, the Treaty and the Financial Regulation. I think it is crucial that it is clearly stated that we have three options. We can choose to give a discharge, we can choose not to give a discharge, or we can postpone reaching a decision on the matter. The rules will now also include a very important distinction between a technical postponement and a political postponement, where the reason must be clearly stated, as well as a clear distinction between the technical closing of the accounts and a political decision on whether or not we can adopt the accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing which is clear is that in December we chose to activate the rules concerning Parliament's role as the discharging authority. And as a follow‐up to the extensive discussions which accompanied that, it is crucial that we now have some clear rules on how we should act in a similar situation to the one we saw before. I therefore think the Fayot report is a good proposal for what our rules should be.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Voggenhuber </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, when the most elementary rules of logic are disregarded in politics, it is rarely out of ignorance of these rules but because there is some interest in doing so. That is why the question I am asking myself today is this: why was it in Parliament"s interests to block its own supervisory powers? Might it not be the case that in the past – and I hope only in the past – it was more in the interests of the large groups in this House to protect the Commission than to call it to account and strengthen their own Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Treaties, Parliament takes the decision on discharge by a simple majority. However, Parliament divided this decision into two procedures. Accordingly, the vote to grant discharge was by a simple majority, but the vote to refuse discharge was by an absolute majority. Hence the comical and completely absurd situation of a majority of this Parliament not voting in favour of granting discharge to the Commission, and the same Commission still not being refused discharge. This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs, which I can only put down to huge self‐interest, and I hope that the large coalitions which put protecting the Commission before Parliament"s right of control have learnt from the events of the past months and will be more loyal to Parliament than their Commissioners in the future.</p>

<p class="contents">The final text contains some positive points, but several other points leave us feeling somewhat dissatisfied. With regard to the more positive points, I should like to highlight the fact that we did not make a limited ad hoc amendment within the framework of the 1996 financial year; instead we set out a reform that will be valid for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that we have kept to our decision to refuse discharge, contrary to what had been expected. Any other decision would have been paradoxical to say the least in view of everything that has happened since December. We have the option of refusing discharge outright. Such refusal does not necessarily lead to a motion of censure, although it should logically lead Parliament to look at the need for one. What is more, we have done away with the anomaly in the Rules of Procedure whereby a refusal must be voted for by an absolute majority of the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not entirely agree with some of the points adopted, for example, the fact that the President can inform the Commission of the reasons behind a refusal of discharge simply by letter, as this seems a rather secretive way of going about things. However, it would of course be necessary to eventually set out the reasons why Parliament might refuse to grant discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second point of contention relates to the role played by the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is in the process of losing the option it has had until now of giving its opinion on the amendments before they are put to the vote in the House. In my view, this responsibility was a positive element and I regret that it has been amended.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, instead of saying that the amendments are inadmissible, the report should be referred back to the committee responsible if they are adopted. These are the points in the report on which we disagree.</p>

However, on the basis of the opinion of its Legal Service, the Commission should just like to make a comment of a legal and institutional nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge procedure is governed by Article 206 of the Treaty and the decision to grant discharge was designed as a means of support to the initial financial nature based on the report by the Court of Auditors, despite the fact that over the years this has taken on a political dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to grant discharge is a single act that cannot be divided up into a political decision on the discharge and a decision to close the accounts, which is to be taken at the same time. Such a division would change the institutional balance and require the Treaties to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if discharge is refused, the accounts for that financial year need to be closed. This would therefore entail Parliament taking a decision to close the accounts, by default, and would mean that the actual procedures followed for the budget for 1982, 1992 and 1996 would be laid down formally. The Commission, for its part, will consider the legal feasibility of including such an option within the framework of the reform of the financial regulation.</p>
