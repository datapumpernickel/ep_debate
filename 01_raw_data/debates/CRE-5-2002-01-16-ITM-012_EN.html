<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold"> Davies (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I had not followed the last report in any detail but if Commissioner Wallström is in the same sort of mood as Commissioner Bolkestein, I am glad I am not tabling any amendments today.</p>
<p class="contents">On a complete change of note, a few weeks ago I was reading to my daughter, Kate, from <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span> by the 19th-century British author Charles Dickens. Scrooge sat in his counting house, he wrote. "The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air."</p>
<p class="contents">It must be a great cause for cheer in European cities today that we no longer have to breathe that "palpable brown air". It is a sign of environmental progress and achievement that air quality now is better than it has been for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is more yet to be done, and in its Clean Air for Europe programme the Commission has identified particulates and ozone as two priorities for action.</p>
<p class="contents">Ozone pollution contributes to the premature death of tens of thousands of people each year; it causes breathing difficulties, coughs, headaches and eye irritation. The World Health Organisation has not been able to identify a threshold below which there are no effects.</p>
<p class="contents">It can also damage vegetation, reduce crop yields and stunt the growth of forests and, like acid rain, it can eat into and destroy the fabric of buildings and works of art.</p>
<p class="contents">And so we have this draft directive to address the problem. It started out as a remarkably weak proposal, the key element of which was to set targets for 2010 for the maximum number of exceedances above WHO guidelines, but these targets would not have been binding on Member States. It also called for the preparation of short-term action plans to deal with acute problems and for more public information and health alerts.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of the past two years, Parliament has been able to use its codecision powers to give this legislation some teeth. We have strengthened the public's right to information. We have made it easier for recalcitrant countries to be named and shamed into improving their performance. We have ensured that damage to materials is included amongst the criteria for consideration. We have re-emphasised our wish to see long-term reductions in ozone levels achieved by 2020 in line with the National Emissions Ceilings Directive proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">But above all, we have addressed the issue of the non-binding short-term targets. Instead of Member States having to work to achieve these "as far as possible", which was the original proposal, we have insisted that effective measures <span class="italic">shall</span> be taken unless the targets cannot be achieved by "proportionate measures". I want to emphasise that we agreed this wording because both the Commission and our own legal services advised us that it <span class="italic">would </span>make the provisions of the directive enforceable and that Member States <span class="italic">could </span>be taken to the European Court of Justice if they failed to take such measures. In other words, we have used our codecision powers to transform a statement of good intent into a legally binding commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, the European Environmental Bureau has criticised us, asking: "Why do we need a directive at all if the 2010 targets are not fully binding?" But this misunderstands the nature of ozone pollution. It is hugely transboundary. While peak exceedances are falling across Europe, the average level is continuing to rise, almost certainly as a result of pollution generated far from our shores.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that Spain, or Italy, or Germany, or any of us should face the prospect of legal sanctions because they are being polluted from China. That would not be fair and it would not be realistic. I want Member States here to be required to do all that they can realistically to meet the targets, no more and no less.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that "palpable brown air" gave a lot of character to the story of Scrooge. But it is not appropriate now. Perhaps I will ask my daughter, Kate, if she will write a 21st-century version featuring clean air.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with the assistance of the Commission and the last Belgian Presidency, Parliament has been able in the meantime to use its negotiating powers to turn a simple wish list into a requirement for our various governments to take action which will significantly improve air quality across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have secured greater changes and a more ambitious directive than we could reasonably have expected when the draft was first proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be proud of what we have achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The concentration of ozone, as we know, is due to the accumulation in the atmosphere of precursor agents, but there is no easy solution, of course, to eradicating them, because these precursor agents sometimes act to reduce ozone in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Various measurements taken at national level have shown that, in climatic conditions such as high luminosity and a stable atmosphere, reducing the precursor agents does not produce the desired effect of reducing the concentration of ozone. In fact, it does the complete opposite. Therefore, the solution to the problem of ozone concentration is extremely complex and simply shutting off the sources that generate precursor agents is not an appropriate measure. An example of this would be closing down a factory chimney that emits smoke, which is a precursor agent of ozone, into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and various members of the Committee on the Environment – including myself – have been working intensely for almost two years to both improve the Commission’s proposal, which was undoubtedly necessary, and also to achieve a balanced proposal that would ensure maximum compliance by the Member States. Lastly, in October, a joint text was produced, which was then approved by the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise a very positive aspect of the proposal that has been adopted, which is the combination of long-term objectives with a short-term approach to these high-risk situations, and all the measures designed to ensure rigorous control and monitoring of ozone levels in the atmosphere in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important to apply the principle of transparency where information is concerned, since the population must be more and better informed about the incidences of ozone levels in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is the consideration of meteorological conditions and comparisons between the various Member States, which must lead to information being provided so that we can monitor developments in this issue in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive represents a major step in the right direction, providing a balanced approach to the problem of contamination and, together with the directive on national emission ceilings, we feel that these will genuinely prove to be very important tools with which we can address environmental problems and especially the problem of contamination in a cross-functional way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, thank you first of all to Commissioner Wallström and Mr Davies for the good work they have done on this matter. Specifically where ozone is concerned, we are of course in an odd situation. High up in the atmosphere, the ozone layer is too thin, which causes problems, including health problems. Down here on earth, on the other hand, the concentration is, of course, far too strong. I think, however, that we have obtained a good result from the conciliation negotiations and, in actual fact, probably a better result than many of us had dared to hope for when we listened to some of the Member States’ negative attitudes towards solving the air quality problem with which we are concerned here. Together with the Directive on National Emission Ceilings, for which Mrs Myller, here beside me, was rapporteur, this directive makes an important contribution to securing a lower concentration of ozone in Europe and, especially, in the large cities of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is good that we have been given a starting point in the form of the WHO’s assessments of the existing risks to health and to the environment. We have got some partial goals established, or target values for 2010, and these must be met. However, it is naturally cause for concern that, for many years, we shall be obliged to accept that the WHO’s thresholds are being exceeded to a certain extent on a certain number of days per year. I therefore think it good that we also obtained agreement to there having to be some more long-term objectives, in terms of which the WHO’s target values must be complied with. What was agreed was not quite so precise as we should have liked here in Parliament. A reference point was set for 2020. Many of us should have liked to have seen 2020 become a more definite deadline for meeting the WHO’s recommendations. I also believe it is good that the Member States should not only be obliged to prepare practical programmes for achieving the targets, but that obligations should also be imposed in terms of informing people about the programmes that are being prepared and about the results – both positive and negative – that are obtained, just as we have acquired a number of rules as to when people are to be notified that there are problems with the unduly strong concentration of ozone – both people in general and people belonging to groups which are especially sensitive to problems in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that I also think it is good that we have got the candidate countries on board so that they can be involved early on. We can of course now look forward to the directive’s coming into force before the first candidate countries accede to the EU so that, even at the time of their accession, they will have to comply with the obligations imposed by the directive upon existing Member States. I hope that, by means of this directive, we can prevent and reduce the harmful effects of the unduly high concentrations of ozone upon people’s health and upon vegetation and that today might prove to have been a good day for future air quality in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It amends the 1996 Directive so as to meet the national emission ceilings for atmospheric pollutants and the recommendations of the World Health Organisation. The work of Parliament in the drafting of the Directive was significant, and so once again our warm congratulations go to Mr Davies and to our other colleagues who were involved in this process, which lasted over two years. In addition, we need to give our special thanks once again for the work of Belgium as Council President.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Directive which has now been approved, the Member States are obliged to submit plans which will allow the limit values necessary for the protection of human health and of vegetation to be lowered by 2010. 2020 will be the benchmark year for long-term objectives and for the subsequent revision of the Directive. In special risk zones, short-term action plans plus active and open information and publicity work are also required.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of this Directive, it is of particular importance that an attempt be made to also involve all the candidate countries at as early a stage as possible, since the distance impact of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds on lower atmosphere ozone levels is significant. In Finland for example the greater part of the ozone present in the lower atmosphere originates from transboundary pollution, in other words from emissions which our country could, in reality, hardly influence at all without the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as you have personally remarked, we have arrived at the half-way point in Parliament's fifth term of elected office. Parliament has already at this stage of its term been able to exert significant influence on the improvement of the air quality in the Union and the candidate countries. In the environmental field, Parliament has thus used its new and enhanced authority in a good and responsible manner. This work needs to be continued, the Commission must be encouraged to be more ambitious when drafting its proposals, and the good cooperation developed with the Council in the field of the environment needs to be kept as warm and effective as it is at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to this directive, we shall be able to protect vegetation and people’s health from the damaging effects of unduly high concentrations of ozone, except in those cases where that cannot be brought about by proportionate measures. I therefore warmly welcome the Conciliation Committee’s joint draft from 11 November 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been pointed out, the directive has been improved on essential points in the process from common position to final directive. It has become clearer and more consistent, and that has been possible thanks to the high quality of the European Parliament’s proposal and of the successful negotiations during the conciliation. I wish quite simply to take the opportunity of conveying my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Davies, and all the members of the Conciliation Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
