We know from the Latvian press that many people are still suffering the consequences, even now. Latvia was not directly affected, but we have 6000 liquidators. Today half of them are invalids and 500 are dead.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal contact with Chernobyl was very close. On the day of the accident I was kayaking in Ukraine and I heard about it only two days later when one of the locals asked me whether I had heard about the accident at the nuclear power station nearby. My second contact with it was through my brother-in-law, an ordinary man who was called to liquidate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">On the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, the European Commission joins the European Parliament in a thorough reflection on the consequences of the accident and, in particular, on the lessons learned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, since 1991, the European Union has provided important financial assistance to improve nuclear safety in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Kazakhstan, including the consequences at the Chernobyl site itself. To Ukraine alone, the Community has provided more than half a billion euros in assistance to projects relating to nuclear safety, including assistance to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">As a measure of continued EU commitment, the Commission has also proposed an instrument for nuclear safety to reinforce it outside the European Union borders for the period 2007-2013, with a proposed budget of EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">For the international community, the Chernobyl accident represented a turning point, raising awareness of the need for rules and common standards to reduce the risk of an accident to a minimum, as well as preparation for immediate reaction in case of a radiological emergency. A number of international conventions signed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency reflect the response of the international community in the wake of the accident: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident; the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency; the Convention on Nuclear Safety; the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material; and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The European Atomic Energy Community and the Member States are contracting parties to all these conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, I would recall that the chapter in the Euratom Treaty on health and safety provides both for the protection of the health of workers and of the general public against the dangers arising from radiation. The Treaty also obliges Member States and operators to supply the Commission with regular information on installations and nuclear material in their possession.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, secondary legislation reflects the lessons learnt from the Chernobyl tragedy. This includes foodstuffs legislation: soon after the accident, restrictions on certain agricultural imports were adopted and some border controls still apply today. If ever needed, a Community mechanism will allow prompt fixing of the maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is secondary legislation on emergency planning: there is an obligation that the necessary emergency plans must be drawn up at a national and local level, including inside the facilities, and emergency teams must be in place. Member States must cooperate in emergency planning and in responding to an emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is secondary legislation on information in cases of radiological emergency: a Community system is in place for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency. All Member States, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey participate in that mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, all Member States have established on their territory a network of facilities for monitoring the levels of radioactivity in the environment. It was such equipment in the Nordic countries that detected the Chernobyl accident well before it was revealed by the authorities of the Soviet Union. Informing the population covers advance information to people living close to nuclear installations, as well as protection mechanisms to be provided to the population actually affected by such an emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has provided financial support for the upgrading of the operating conditions of a number of nuclear installations within the European Union. The reactors where sufficient upgrading could not be carried out will be or have been closed down. The staged closure of the remaining reactors in Ignalina, Bohunice and Kozloduy was agreed in the negotiations for accession to the European Union. They will be closed and we will provide financial support for the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1986, the European Union has made significant progress particularly in the fields of safety, radiation protection and emergency preparedness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to thank Parliament yet again for its support of the EU role in nuclear safeguards, as expressed in the resolution of 15 March 2006 on the Lisbon Strategy. This resolution recalls that the EU possesses globally acknowledged expertise in the area of nuclear energy and notes that this expertise relates, inter alia, to the efficiency and quality of production installations and to decommissioning processes. It is also worth recalling that the Council in June 2004 set up a working party on nuclear safety, which is due to produce a final report at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is also aware that the Commission has made specific legislative proposals intended to provide the Union with common rules on nuclear safety, safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and decommissioning funds. Furthermore, the Commission will make every effort in the area of research and development to help to find a sustainable solution to the issue of the radioactive waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I wish to thank Parliament for its support and I thank you very much for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the accident that occurred exactly twenty years ago in the western part of what was then the Soviet Union was the first European environmental disaster to have an impact on the whole of the continent, and one of our responsibilities today is to ensure that it remains the only one. We are, on a day such as this, profoundly touched by the fates of the victims of this tragedy and their families, of the workers at the power station and the rescue workers who sacrificed their lives in order to save the population from something worse, of those who lived in the immediate vicinity and those who were later to be, directly or indirectly, the victims of the nuclear fallout, among them many children, who were particularly hard hit by the effects.</p>
<p class="contents">An area of some 40 000 square kilometres, corresponding approximately to the territory of Belgium, is so heavily contaminated by radiation that it will, for decades to come, be uninhabitable and incapable of being used for agricultural purposes. I have just been reminded that the explosion in this nuclear power plant occurred, not when it was being used for civilian purposes, but while military experiments were being carried on there.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, today, who have to discuss how dictatorships handle nuclear energy, the name of Chernobyl must be a warning. It still, alas, needs to be said today that the attitude of those who were in positions of responsibility at that time in the Soviet Union towards the people in the affected towns and villages around the stricken reactor was very largely one of contempt.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past twenty years, a great deal has been done in every quarter of the world to help those affected by the disaster and to support people who have to deal with its after-effects. The innumerable associations and institutions that have done such splendid work in this field deserve our gratitude. The sufferings of the victims and the dedication shown by many people in the European Union make it quite improper that that anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster should be used for political ends and as the occasion of a debate on the evils of atomic energy as such. What is of fundamental importance is that nuclear safety be improved and guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The power station at Chernobyl was shut down in December 2000; the decision to do so was welcomed in this House and by the European Union as a major contribution to improved nuclear safety in Europe and I would remind Commissioner Piebalgs of our consistent record of very good cooperation with the Commission. The European Union has also played a substantial part in making safe the site of the accident at Chernobyl. December 1997 saw the setting-up of a fund for the sheltering of the Chernobyl reactor, the intention being that the population and the environment would be protected from further radioactive contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the collapse of the Iron Curtain and – in particular – the eastward enlargement of the European Union two years ago helped to make the use of atomic power in Europe safer. Whereas, as recently as 2001, nine nuclear power stations with a total of 27 blocks of similar design to Chernobyl were connected up to the network, the new Member States, in the accession treaties, undertook to decommission them over the years to come. It is very important that the compromise on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective be used to help make funds for the decommissioning of these sites available as quickly as possible. Rather than now leaving to their own devices those accession countries that have to cope with the problems arising from the Chernobyl disaster, we must act in a spirit of solidarity with them, and in so doing we will be doing something for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, a high standard of safety for atomic power plant has been established within the European Union, and it is now time for our neighbours to share in it, while we, at the same time, must further promote research into reactor safety, to which the research framework programme currently being considered by this House can make an important contribution. This is a policy that we want to pursue and we very much hope that we will be able to guarantee security of energy supply without interfering with sustainable development or the well-being of the environment. Whatever the safety requirements, then – and they are absolutely justified – the peaceful use of atomic power has to be considered in the context of the security of Europe’s supplies, and it is with that in mind that we must all work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The suffering of these people cannot be measured. I myself, when I was the mayor of a German town, had the opportunity to look after the children of families that had been victims of the contamination of Chernobyl, and it was one of the most bitter experiences of my political life. The cynicism of those who bore responsibility for what happened defies description, and I agree with Mr Poettering’s view that, if we are to remember what happened on this day twenty years ago, we have to remember that this was the result of an accident in a dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The suppression of facts and the evasion and denial of responsibility caused time to be lost, time that was needed if action was to be taken at once to reduce the suffering of human beings. If, then, today, you remember the victims, you must also recall who was responsible and be clear in your own mind about how great, how historic, that responsibility is. I do not, however, share Mr Poettering’s view that this recollection should not be used as the occasion for some fundamental decision-making about how atomic power is used.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As in all groups in this House – no, sorry, except perhaps for the Greens – there are differences of opinion within my own group.</p>
<p class="contents">There are party colleagues of mine who take a different view from my own, but every single one of us must, in the aftermath of Chernobyl, answer the question of which it has furnished an example and which it has made visible to every single human being, namely the question as to whether that which is technically possible is, in fact, morally defensible. As I see it, the answer has already been given, and it is in the negative.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are three fundamental reasons for scepticism about atomic energy. Firstly, it can be argued that accidents in atomic power stations are rare; indeed they are, but, when they occur, they are so devastating in their effects that one must, considering the minor risk that may be present against the disaster that it equally well may entail, decide that the slight risk is not worth it. I do not believe that that is a matter of doubt.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is another reason. Only in recent weeks, we have seen in India an example of what we are discussing with relation to Iran, namely that the misuse of civilian use for military purposes is nothing new, but rather something that has been going on for decades. The International Atomic Energy Agency never had any jurisdiction over military use, but nor was it ever able to prevent the ban on proliferation being circumvented by civilian installations being built and then used for military purposes. The risk of that is too great.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is precisely because of the seamless transition from one use to another that the United States of America has, by its misconduct, given rise to yet another example. The basis on which war with Iraq was embarked on was a questionable argument of ‘we do not negotiate with dictators like Saddam who want to acquire weapons of mass destruction’, yet, at the same time, negotiations were in progress with a dictator – one in North Korea – who actually did possess nuclear weapons, so the message sent out was: ‘we will not attack you if you have nuclear weapons, but we will if you do not’. That amounted to an invitation to every dictator on the planet to get his hands on illegal nuclear weapons as quickly as possible. That, too, must be considered when we discuss Chernobyl.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ever since my earliest youth, I have campaigned in my own country against nuclear power. The fact that the experience did not turn me into a Green is, I would say, a happy circumstance for the Greens, but there are many in my political family who think as I do; there are others who do not, and I want to speak out clearly on their behalf too; I have to appreciate their arguments and put them forward too. There are members of my group who, like Mr Poettering, believe that this is a risk that may be taken, and I must have respect for them as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, though, one thing I would like to add: it is that it is an unfortunate fact that we all find a certain cynicism inescapable. Opponents of the use of nuclear energy know that there are those who are in favour of it and that there are those who can make its use a reality. A new nuclear reactor is currently under construction in Finland. There are states around the world that are only now beginning to make civilian use of nuclear power, and it is because the risks are so great that those, too, who are opposed to nuclear energy as a matter of principle have an interest in our investing as much money as possible in the highest possible safety standards for it. That may be cynical, but it is a kind of cynicism that we, twenty years on from Chernobyl, have to put up with.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graham Watson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, at 1.23 a.m. on 26 April 1986 an alarm sounded that signalled the world’s worst ever civil nuclear accident.</p>
<p class="contents">The explosion at the Chernobyl power plant spewed radioactive waste over vast swathes of the former USSR and Western Europe, and rendered an area with a radius of 30 km uninhabitable to humankind. It is fitting that we express today our solidarity with the victims of that accident and that we recognise the serious impact that it had on so many lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Official UN figures predicted up to 9 000 cancer-related deaths as a result of that accident. However, a Greenpeace report released last week estimated 93 000, which could rise to around 200 000 if we include other related illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to speak, however, of the future, not of the past. Chernobyl remains a symbol of the perils of nuclear fuel and the reason why we must work with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that have nuclear reactors based on the same design, to render those as safe as possible while they must function, and take them out of commission as soon as we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the Commissioner’s commitment to the development of renewable technologies. The Commissioner will shortly be visiting my constituency, where we are closing nuclear power plants and developing renewable fuels. With finite resources fast depleting, Europe will have to radically re-examine its patterns of energy supply and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">This is especially true at a time of chronic instability in the Middle East, of alarming hikes in the price of crude oil, and increased competition for resources. If we are to avoid being 90% dependent on Russian oil by 2020, we have to achieve greater autonomy in energy supply and develop a common energy policy with an intelligent, balanced energy mix. Money invested in clean green technology is not money wasted and if Europe can lead the world in researching green technologies it will create more jobs, revive manufacturing, and generate greater export potential for our products.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my Group applauds the Council and the Austrian Presidency for backing plans to double the use of biomass, including organic waste, for energy purposes, allowing us to cut energy imports by over 6% and bring up to 300 000 jobs to rural areas</p>
<p class="contents">With overall consumption rising, greater energy efficiency combined with the renewables could generate around 25% of our needs. We have got to increase that figure, we have got to make a genuine commitment to investment in technologies for the future. Investing in projects such as hydrogen fuel might have the potential to achieve oil savings equivalent to 13% of global oil demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the substantial contribution that nuclear power already makes to our energy autonomy, there must be renewed momentum to invest in safety, both to ensure that nuclear power stations produce less waste and present less risk and to develop Europe’s research into fusion energy through the Euratom framework and the experiment in Cadarache in France.</p>
<p class="contents">Lenin believed that progress could be achieved only through socialism and electricity. History has judged him wrong on the first count but perhaps not on the second. Nobody denies that we need a sustainable and secure energy supply; they disagree only on the mix.</p>
<p class="contents">The anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster is a reminder of the challenges we face in delivering our energy requirements while minimising the risks. We owe it to the victims of Chernobyl to develop safe, reliable and sustainable sources of energy.</p>

We should remember the thousands of people who have died and will die and the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer as a result of the accident at Chernobyl. Despite 20 years having passed, citizens and policy-makers are not well-informed about the extensive consequences of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuclear lobby stated last week in <span class="italic">European Voice</span> that only 50 people died as a result of Chernobyl. The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna spoke about 4000 deaths up to the beginning of last week, and had to revise this figure upwards under pressure from new independent studies, one of these commissioned by our colleague Mrs Harms.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the political lessons to be learnt from Chernobyl? First of all, we need more dignity. Victims of Chernobyl have faced considerable difficulty in getting recognition. The victims deserve dignity. They should not have to fight constantly against those who seek to suppress or to deny their suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need absolute transparency – <span class="italic">glasnost</span> – on the real consequences of the accident. The International Atomic Energy Agency, a UN pro-nuclear biased agency, must no longer be allowed to interfere and suppress studies from the World Health Organisation on the health impact of radiation. We therefore have to end the 1959 agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organisation as provide in Article 12 of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true for Euratom – and I thank Mr Rübig of the PPE-DE Group who, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, has taken the initiative of raising the issue of putting an end to Euratom. This agency cannot be a pro-nuclear agency and be independent on related health issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need absolute transparency on the plans of the nuclear industry. Today 450 nuclear reactors produce 2.5% of world energy and 6% of European energy demands. If nuclear energy is the answer to security supply and to climate change, that percentage would need to rise from 2.5 to 30, 40, 50 or 60% of the mix. We are not speaking about one reactor here and one reactor there. We are speaking about 4000, 5000, 6000 or 7000 reactors. That is what the nuclear industry wants because we do not have plutonium. That means fast breeders, enrichment, retreatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we want this risk to be taken in a world where accidents in the nuclear chain cannot be excluded, where al-Qa’ida and other terrorists lie in wait, where proliferation is revealed in the Iran crisis? Societies must learn. Societies survive only if they learn the lessons from history. Now is the time for decision.</p>

Even today, 20 years after the event, we can see the appalling consequences. We can see these consequences in the form of the illnesses and disablement of thousands of people. We can see them in the form of enormous areas of land that are uninhabitable and that will be so for many generations to come. Even in my own little corner of Europe, in the north of Sweden, the radioactive fallout had an impact over many years through the contamination of the natural world that it caused.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear accident that we have had, but we must not forget that it is not the only one. Do not forget Three Mile Island and all the other near-accidents that have occurred in the history of the nuclear industry. Nuclear power is not safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 20 years there have been very few new nuclear reactors built in Europe. This means that we have a lot of aged reactors that continue to be in full operation. Aged reactors are dangerous reactors. It is time to plan seriously to decommission these older nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chernobyl disaster is a reminder of the risks of nuclear power. To this should be added the fact that the issue of nuclear waste has still not been resolved. We are today producing nuclear waste that we still do not know how we are to store. We are leaving it up to future generations. Nuclear power has also proved to be a very expensive source of energy. This does not just mean that production costs are high but also that there are very high costs for dealing with retired reactors and the waste that is produced.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, nuclear power is a finite resource. The fuel will run out one day. We are currently on the brink of an enormous change–over of energy sources. It is absolutely imperative that we phase out our dependence on oil and fossil fuels. The primary reason for this is not the price of oil but the greenhouse effect. It would be a fateful mistake to replace dependence on oil with a new and even greater dependence on nuclear power. Instead of this, we have before us a unique opportunity to develop durable, renewable ‘green alternatives’. We also need to dramatically reduce our dependence on energy. This is the conviction of the majority of the left in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must, however, play its part in all of this. More of the EU’s research money needs, then, to be spent on sources of renewable energy, and less on research into nuclear power, and the current EURATOM Treaty, which has been outdated for a number of years, needs to be repealed. Only when we have abolished nuclear power will the risks of new Chernobyl disasters be done away with.</p>

We still do not know how many people died. We do not know how many people we need to remember today. Some talk of 4 000, Greenpeace talks of 93 000 and we still do not know what the exact figure will ultimately be. People are still dying. Caesium has an active cycle of 35 years. Twenty years have gone by, meaning that cancer will be lodged in the human body for another 15 years. Deaths from thyroid cancer have multiplied a hundredfold. There have been a great many deaths from leukaemia and this evil will not stop and will continue for a great many years.</p>
<p class="contents">They are already preparing a new 'frame' to cover Chernobyl. At some point they have poured 200 metres of concrete and there are still leaks. So they are going to make a steel cover that will cost several billion euros, in a country in which pensions have been a mere EUR 20 a month for the last 100 years. The fatal radioactive materials will be there for 100 000 years. So that you understand how long we are talking about, Christ died just 2 000 years ago and Noah's flood was just 5 000 years ago. So just imagine how many thousands of years it will be active. What conclusion do we need to draw? That this is very, very dangerous yet, at the same time, the number of nuclear stations is multiplying.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said that Bulgaria has promised to close Kozludy. Yes, this is a promise, but he did not tell us that Bulgaria is already building another nuclear station a few kilometres away, just 50 kilometres from the second largest city in Greece and less than 1 000 kilometres from Rome as the crow flies. If, therefore, a similar incident occurs, you understand what damage and how many deaths we shall have in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us here – in one of the biggest parliaments in the world – must find the courage and vote and talk and argue against nuclear power. We must call for nuclear disarmament. Turkey is already building three nuclear stations and I do not want to say that Turkish and Bulgarian engineers are more inferior to Soviet engineers who, if nothing else, were the first in this field and still suffered the accident. However, if some terrorist were to launch a missile at such a station, do you understand what the damage would be? The probable damage is huge compared to the economic benefit that nuclear stations can bring to the energy problem. We need to weigh up the evil and take important initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also report the following sad fact: this year Greece does not have enough soldiers. Do you know why? Because there were 3 500 miscarriages immediately after Chernobyl and we lost a lot of children who could have been in the army today. We must therefore pay very careful attention to our future, to the future of our children and to the future of the next generations. Democracy needs courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was particularly moved by what Commissioner Piebalgs said in his opening statement about the people who went in immediately after the accident to do the clean-up work, to try to put concrete into the sarcophagus, and to try to protect the rest of the population. Those people are forgotten today in our discussions. They gave their lives knowing that it was a suicide mission but, for fellow mankind and for the greater good of their countrymen and countrywomen, they took that action and took that dangerous task on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Today when we speak about Chernobyl and the nuclear industry, the two go hand in hand. Despite what people may say about advances in technology or the new safety measures that have been put in place, the risks associated with nuclear energy are so vast and so great. The waste product has an active life of thousands of years that we can neither control nor manage.</p>
<p class="contents">Before World War II, a famous American general made this comment about possible atomic weapons: ‘Atomic weapons are to an army what an elephant is to a mouse. If we can control them and use them for our good, it is a great thing; but by scale and virtue of size it is impossible for a mouse to control what an elephant will do’. Likewise, I believe it is impossible for mankind to control what nuclear energy will do. The best option we have is to forego the nuclear option and look at alternatives, as other people have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">To move away from that argument back to today: when we think of the lessons of 20 years, in Ukraine and Belarus and in other parts of Europe there are still children being born with birth defects. There is a cardiac condition known as Chernobyl heart, where young children who should be full of health and full of life suffer severe heart attacks and strokes because of the impact of radiation and the fallout they have in their own systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In the late 1980s and early 1990s a voluntary group called the Chernobyl Children’s Project was set up in Ireland by one woman who saw the horrors of Chernobyl. Since then, every summer, 14 000 children have been brought from Chernobyl to Ireland for a three-week break in a clean environment, to get fresh air, to live with host families, to know what it is like to live in a proper family environment, and to get medical and dental treatment. Over that period of time, that voluntary group has raised over EUR 60 million for humanitarian and medical aid for Chernobyl and Belarus. There are many other small projects like that, which are run by individuals who saw the need.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end with this short quote. Dostoyevsky said: ‘No world event is worth the shedding of one child’s tear’. Just think of all the tears that have been shed by children and by families because of Chernobyl. It is our responsibility to ensure that it cannot happen again.</p>

What is more, we read with alarm about the number of people who, as a result of Chernobyl, still die before their time. I was two months pregnant 20 years ago. As has been well-documented, my country, the then Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, did not escape the nuclear fallout. I would not want anybody to go through pregnancy with the gnawing, agonising fear of whether the child will be born healthy or a victim of the human errors, the propaganda lies and the arrogance of the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the EU has invested hundreds of millions of euros into softening the impact of the nuclear disaster and I believe that it is in the interests of every citizen of the EU-25 to contribute towards the new safe sarcophagus over the Chernobyl plant and towards gradually getting life back on track in the area around Chernobyl, within the realms of what is feasible. I travel to Ukraine and I see the endeavours of the people in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, despite all the horrors and fear that the word Chernobyl arouses to this day, I believe that we must admit that the EU cannot do without nuclear energy. As we are all aware, more than half of EU citizens are firmly opposed to the construction of new nuclear reactors. It is also true, however, that Russia, China, India and the United States have given the green light to nuclear energy. It also disturbs me greatly that in the last four years the price of gas has doubled, and that the EU has become a hostage to the Russian firm Gazprom, which, conscious of its power in the field of raw materials, recently clearly showed what it is capable of doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us be realistic and admit that most EU citizens will not obtain energy from biomass and wind farms, yet all citizens will want to switch lights on, heat their houses and manufacture goods; in short, they will want to live and use energy. I am convinced that nuclear energy is vital if the EU is to maintain both economic efficiency and living standards. In this regard, it would be opportune to tell the citizens openly that this will not be possible without new, modern and, as far as possible, the safest nuclear reactors. I feel that Greenpeace stunts or wind farms cannot take on the competition from Asia and America, which is based on using nuclear energy. I very much hope that this is clear not only to the Commission – which after all is well aware of the fact – but above all to Germany, which wants to decommission nuclear reactors within 15 years, even though it calls itself the industrial engine of Europe and a driving force for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I have a little nugget to offer opponents of nuclear energy, namely the latest report from Euronews. A short time ago, Euronews experts asserted that atomic energy is the best way of reducing global warming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
