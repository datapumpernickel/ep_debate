<p class="contents">The rapid development of the audio-visual media has brought many real benefits in terms of education, spreading greater awareness of public affairs around the world, and not least in the field of entertainment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, along with the undoubted advantages, there have also been concerns that, given the generally greater adeptness of children at using audio-visual resources, in some areas there are dangers of their obtaining access to unsuitable or harmful material. This is most obvious in the fields of overt sexual material and gratuitous violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles which have guided this report are to encourage greater public awareness of these issues and to support parental responsibility and to develop co-operation between the content providers, consumer organisations and the respective authorities, both national and European. Self-regulation is considered to be the main instrument, underpinned by legal requirements where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, which analyses the Commission's evaluation report, is primarily concerned with the Internet and with video games, as it was felt important not to anticipate a possible future review of the Television without Frontiers directive. The report calls for user-friendly content filter systems to enable parents to predetermine the sort of content which they feel is unsuitable viewing for their children and, in this regard I very much welcome the fact that, since the report was first drafted, the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA), has launched a filter system available free of charge, an initiative supported by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We also called for greater public awareness, for education campaigns and hotlines to be set up, as already exists in TV broadcasting, so that complaints about illegal or harmful content may be recorded by consumers, particularly by parents.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that so-called 'Internet Chat Rooms' should be subject to greater monitoring, both of the rules for their installation and in relation to their use. As far as video games are concerned, we call upon the Member States to continue to promote the rating of video games, again through self-regulation, but if that is considered to be inadequate in some cases, it should be backed up by the introduction of agreed minimum standards of content and promotion. It is also hoped that the Member States will continue to exchange best practice in this field and co-ordinate measures which are taken in co-operation with the industry and with content providers.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not seek to sensationalise or exaggerate perceived dangers, but it does provide a useful framework to encourage public awareness of the risks involved and to provide practical remedies. Finally, Parliament calls on the Commission to draw up a further report, preferably before the end of this year, on the implementation of the recommendation with specific reference to implementation in each Member State. I commend the report to the House.</p>

It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission has presented this evaluation report on the progress we are making in this area in relation to audio-visual media and the Internet. Mr Beazley, as Mr Heaton-Harris before him, has drafted a sterling report on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to take this opportunity of drawing your attention once again to the fact that technical resources and legislation from above are not sufficient to guarantee this protection. There are always ways and means, devious or otherwise, to get round this, and certainly children are very resourceful in this area. Self-regulation, as is now being applied on a large scale, appears to be a very handy instrument. However, I want to point out again at this juncture that instilling awareness in minors themselves, as well as their parents and educators, is still the best way forward. This is possible by, on the one hand, paying ample attention to media education at school, so that minors can be taught to identify harmful content for themselves, and, on the other hand, by providing educators with a tool, such as the Dutch ‘viewer guide’ classification system. This is a system on which we had a very interesting hearing yesterday and in which I am also personally involved in the Netherlands. It is a well thought-out system which actually works, and by means of which children can handle audio-visual media products with awareness. The system is also accompanied by an age category. MG6 means: six years, parental guidance desirable, and, in this way, adults are reminded once again of their responsibilities, for uninterested parents produce vulnerable children. I would therefore call on the Member States and the Commission, when studying best practices, to keep this classification system in mind and, when planning school curricula, to make room for media education too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic is, as my predecessor on the floor has confirmed, close to all our hearts. There are many points on which we agree, such as trust being a better fundamental premise for this common endeavour than overall control or even censorship, neither of which would serve as a good basis for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that we must advertise the hotlines more extensively in order for them to be used, as we desire, right across the whole of Europe, and in order for us to be able to establish where protection is needed. We agree, too, that we have to provide parents with the right tools to enable them, together with their children, to assess which TV programmes, computer games, and films are the right ones for their children, and in order to support them in their judgment of the programmes. On this I agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, who spoke before me. This is where moving closer on a European level to a uniform system of classification for the whole audio-visual sector seems to be of the greatest and most urgent importance, as that would be a tool facilitating control by parents and young people themselves, one that could also function on the basis of trust and not tend towards either excessive control or censorship.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to what I believe is at the moment the most important point in connection with this ‘box’, namely that the Internet strikes many as a sort of ‘wonderbox’; they stand in front of it and are simply overwhelmed by all the stuff that comes out of it, forgetting in the process what influences can come into play, especially on children and young people, if we do not consciously discern what is heading in our direction. Let me emphasise it three times, four times, ten times over: media literacy. Media literacy – we cannot start too soon on heightening awareness of it and on playing our part in developing it. To do this, we also need not only the political willingness; we also need more programmes. For them, we need money. Perhaps we will achieve some sort of collaboration with all the players at the European level, something which is, at the end of the day, in the interests of all.</p>

I am sure you have all witnessed in your countries, as I have witnessed in mine, the boom in cheap ‘big brother’ type television programmes in which people agree to be imprisoned, for want of a better word, while viewers are invited to peep through the keyhole, waiting for something titillating to happen, usually – to be frank – a sex scene, or for something unexpected or interesting to happen. But, at the same time, this sort of programme encourages viewers – especially young viewers – to look on the people playing this sort of lottery, betting body and soul in the hope of winning money at the expense of the others, as role models.</p>
<p class="contents">These programmes are objectionable and absurd but we cannot attack them through legislation or administrative intervention. As other speakers have said, technical rules do no good, nor does informing and educating children, because forbidden fruit does, of course, taste sweeter. None of this is enough especially, Commissioner, as everyone will be able to access this sort of programme on the Internet sooner or later. I think we need some sort of European legislation and regulations with more teeth than we have at present. I do not have a great deal of faith in self-regulation because competition lives by its own – very powerful – rules. However, it would be no bad thing if we could come up with some sort of more binding code of conduct than we have at present. If we were to give parents and consumers the right to lay siege to the producers of these cheap programmes, it would, perhaps, provide some small counterweight to competition. And, of course, we could look at the more technical question of watersheds to draw a dividing line between when children watch television and their bedtime and when these programmes go out.</p>
<p class="contents">However, even with all this, unless we come up with something more original and imaginative, I shall persist in my pessimism as to the future and the success of this sort of programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Knowledge and information at your fingertips, 24 hours a day and in large quantities. As I have indicated in previous speeches, however, the Internet and television are a reflection of society. The Commission evaluation report and the report by the rapporteur, Mr Beazley, confirm this. Both media are also used for criminal and degrading purposes. I am pleased with the Commission evaluation report and the rapporteur’s report. It is encouraging that the Commission is able to conclude that, in many Member States, a great deal is being done to prevent the distribution of child pornography. This also applies to other degrading and illegal activities. Attention is rightly drawn to the need for the Commission to continue to urge the Member States to implement the provisions in the recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is also right to draw attention to parental responsibility in the first place, but also to the responsibility of the government and of suppliers of Internet products. They must jointly ensure that human beings are valued as unique creatures and not as instruments to fulfil personal needs. Children, in particular, deserve protection in this area, so that they can develop a healthy image of human beings. This is not just about child pornography. This is also about racism, hatred and other forms of degrading excrescences which can so easily be spread via the Internet and television.</p>
<p class="contents">The global reach of the Internet and television requires an international approach. The wish expressed by Member States to subject national legislative frameworks to minimum standards at European, and probably global, level receives my approval. In my view, the combination of national frameworks and international minimum standards makes sense. This does justice to the global problem and cultural diversity. Moreover, the maintenance of a national legislative framework does not give the Member States the opportunity of hiding behind international legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to consult all parties involved when drafting codes of conduct and other ways of preventing the distribution of pornography and racist material is useful. I should, however, like to add that, in matters of censorship and handling illegal material, the police and justice departments are the legally competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to urge the European Commission to encourage the Member States to continue to pay attention to evils which are distributed via television, video games and films. From the report, it is clear that less progress has been made in these areas than in the area of the Internet. Less clear-cut evils are still evils. And where the protection of minors and human dignity are concerned, we cannot be alert enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On this subject, which concerns the very essence of humanity, there are two main players involved: the family, first of all, which bears full responsibility for the upbringing of its children, and secondly, society, which must ensure that children are protected. It is, therefore, important – as emphasised in the resolution that we are discussing today – to do all we can to ensure that protective frameworks are established, in particular for the forms of media which are used freely by young consumers, be they audiovisual, written resources or on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the victims of abuses of power to be able to turn to a moral authority that can help them. We must increase the means available to these organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Changing the behaviour of adults is something else that will enable us to protect our most vulnerable fellow citizens effectively. We must not be afraid; we must be prepared to go against the flow and to lay down new rules for a moral code that respects all aspects of the individual. We must condemn these counter-models of pleasure, who are all too often idolised by the young, whose points of reference some are seeking to destroy. We should also be inculcating a genuine appreciation of the beautiful, the good and the true in minors, so that they hold the keys to their protection in their own hands.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Mr Papayannakis, I would say that adopting this attitude demonstrates our optimism and I personally am not pessimistic about what society and what individuals can do to effectively protect minors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dangers children and young people are exposed to today are very different to those we were exposed to at that age. TV and the Internet have undoubtedly contributed to this, to a large extent, because they fill youngsters’ heads with ideas that have very little to do with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">A short time ago, a study was published in a Spanish newspaper, which stated that young people seeing, for example, a person throw themselves off the fourth floor of a building and yet run away unharmed or a person stop a speeding bullet with their bare hands without suffering any ill effects, contributes to many young people being unaware of the real danger of such situations. It is thought, furthermore, that such images put too many ideas in their heads and that this is, unfortunately, the cause of the increase in violence amongst young people and even children.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to express my total support for the rapporteur when he calls on Member States to classify video games using self-regulatory mechanisms set up by the industry, and for them to establish ‘abuse departments’. I would also like, of course, to congratulate the Commission on its intention to carry out a study on the classification of films distributed to cinemas, shown on TV, and available on DVD or video.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we need to be aware that we cannot expect to have a world without violence when the adults of the future spend their time watching cartoons, films and news stories that are of an increasingly violent nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the digital age will see the acceleration of current developments in the services offered by the media, which are far from being limited to traditional television, or even to the Internet, but include many other services, and so it is right and necessary that we give thought to the legal form that control and the protection of young people might take, and also set up the means for dealing with them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the legal framework must be adapted to these new developments, at both European and national level. I speak also for my group when I say that I consider self-regulation instruments to be an important addition to a legal framework. We cannot do without standards laid down in law, and these are a compelling necessity. Self-regulation instruments, too, need to be on a legal footing, which means that the promoters, those who provide the programmes, cannot be absolved of their responsibility. To put it another way, we cannot allow service providers to shirk responsibility for their programmes. That is the basic premise. As for how this can be put into practice, there may be – and indeed there are – many ways of going about that. Regulatory arrangements in the Member States are very diverse, which is ultimately due to the fact that they correspond to conventional media systems as these have evolved, and we are not about nullifying all that.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise that self-regulation instruments as additions to the law are something we cannot do without. Technical systems, too, can be indispensable, but they cannot be a substitute for responsibility. We also know that many children and young people, in an age when adults have not mastered the whole range of technical options, are ahead of their parents in that respect. That will change in the long term, but that is the way things are today, and we all know that children can get up to all sorts of tricks, for example when it comes to cracking something. That is why we cannot rely exclusively on technical systems, and why there is a need for contents to be monitored, in which respect there must be restrictions on content, which cannot relate only to real-time<span class="italic"> </span>transmissions. The different time zones in a region over which a satellite broadcasts make that obsolete in any case, and so even that method has serious limitations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that this report takes up my group's call for the continuation and extension of the action plan on the safe use of the Internet, which is due to come to an end at the end of the year. I see this as compellingly necessary. I will conclude by saying that we must take steps to impart media literacy to children, young people and their parents, as a sound capacity for judgment can only come into being if our measures help to develop it.</p>

We welcome initiatives by the Member States in the EU on safer Internet use for children but we need to step up our actions for a more coordinated campaign to fight against Internet paedophilia. When it comes to cybercrime, Member States rightly prioritise the campaign against global terrorism and, additionally, focus on Internet credit card fraud, but more can and should be done on Internet-paedophilia.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I met with the Abusive Images Unit of Greater Manchester Police, a small, committed team led by Terry Jones, leading the field in expertise in the UK on tracing and convicting child abusers on the net. The unit was launched in 1995, when 12 images were seized. In 1999, 41,000 images were seized and one recent conviction revealed a man with over 50,000 images of child abuse. This is not child pornography but gross and indecent sexual abuse. I have seen the pictures. Behind each image is a real child traumatised by their experiences. The police I met with are doing an excellent job and being assisted by new software technology designed again by a local company in my constituency, Surf Control. With this they monitored chat channels for 16 hours. They picked up 48 offenders right across the EU – offenders in positions of trust (teachers and scoutmasters, a foster parent in Germany and a Swedish army sergeant); babies as young as three months had been anally raped.</p>
<p class="contents">Abuse is under-reported. So what should we do in the EU? We need to do more. We need hotlines and to make this a priority at EU and Member State level. This week we voted for a EU network of national monitoring centres on football hooliganism. That is a violent and visible form of abuse, but we can do more for those children who are suffering behind the scenes from fear and violent abuse. Yes, we need self-regulation and partnership, but Internet service providers have to prioritise this. AOL and NTL have excellent reputations, but others are not doing the job. They are not answering the request of police to track down these abusers and they are even beginning to ask to charge the police service for it. I want to see closer cooperation between Europol and EU law enforcement. I want better research and funding for Internet-tracing software. We can do more if we make this a priority and we can protect our children from this violent and heinous form of abuse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You can tell that by the fact that we adopted this report unanimously in committee and that, today in Parliament, there are no amendments to this report left, and that on a topic that involves a very large number of problems and unanswered questions. So many thanks for it. The work we are going to do will be on a very good foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ongoing efforts will be particularly important because the future convergence of the media – television, computers, the Internet – will mean that we will have to find new ways to really guarantee that young people and human dignity will be protected. The proposals submitted by the Commission are therefore very much the right thing, and the Member States' support for them is urgently needed. I would like to again go over the three points that I see as being the most important.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, firstly, new and more highly-developed models of self-regulation, enabling the industry and the responsible Governments to work together on a common basis. It is for this purpose that the model of jointly-coordinated self-regulation has been devised, and we need to develop it further.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is not standards harmonised on a Europe-wide basis that we need, but Europe-wide minimum standards, particularly for video games and the Internet, in order to offer young people real protection.</p>
<p class="contents">And, thirdly, media education is needed not only for children but also for their parents. All these tasks require involvement on the part of the Council, and it is to them, and for that, that I appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The explosion in broadcasting technologies has caused many parents to lose control over what their children watch, and the growth of digital, cable and satellite TV, as well as home computer technology, means that parents are increasingly powerless to monitor their children's viewing habits.</p>
<p class="contents">According to some reports, parents were not aware of the facilities, such as the blocks on pay TV and Internet filters, which help them control what their children watch. Parents need to be given more information on how these work and how trustworthy they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Children's welfare is primarily the responsibility of their legal guardians, but this does not absolve suppliers and distributors of audiovisual content of their responsibilities. Both sides must take full responsibility in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The degree of self-regulation in broadcasting differs from one Member State to another, but we all agree that we must work towards some commonality in this area and that self-regulation must be underpinned by some legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, child pornography on the Internet is unforgivable, and there are vast numbers of websites with illegal content located outside the European Union. I commend the report to the House and thank the rapporteur again for his excellent initiative in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The constantly growing range of multimedia services surely makes safety arrangements necessary – and of a comparable nature right across Europe – in order to protect our children and young people from harmful content and its consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard about the introduction of technical measures such as filters and acoustic warning signals, and also about the possibility of direct intervention in services that offend against the dignity of young people or are a danger to them. These certainly deserve our full support and should be implemented to the same degree in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to remind you that – as the report also points out – many safety arrangements are not there to supplant the responsibilities of the parents, who must, at the end of the day, be the ultimate and most important regulators. We will otherwise not be able to prevent the situation arising where young people may well be unable to buy swastika banners over the Internet, but can do so in the nearest flea market.

I am not going to repeat what other speakers have said but I should like to mention, Commissioner, three specific cases that have been brought to my attention this week.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the mother of a handicapped teenager who goes out to work. For some time, every evening, she has had to go and fetch him, because he is supposed to return home from work at around 5 p.m. but there, he has free access to pornographic sites. This is happening in a major city in France. As things stand, she cannot turn to the local police to close down these sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a letter that I received this week informed me of a site funded jointly by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. This site states that the role of adults is to allow children to sample everything, to try every experience. And there are a number of very specific examples – I shall provide the relevant documents later – funded from the public purse, of the type of thing our children are looking at these days.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, organisations that fight against paedophilia last week sent me a CD-ROM which brings together a large amount of information that is currently available. This CD-ROM was sent to authorities such as Europol over a year ago and no progress at all has yet been made on the matter. Soon, Commissioner, on 8 May, a world summit on children will take place. This afternoon, we will be voting on a resolution on the matter. We would like you, between now and this summit, to hold a meeting with all of the competent bodies to tell us what practical measures you intend to adopt in this field in order to combat this phenomenon.</p>

I must tell you that the Commission supports Parliament, just as Parliament supports the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a shared aim, which is to protect our children. There are different ways of achieving this, as the honourable Members have rightly stated, and in order to accomplish this objective we must, therefore, join forces. I have listened with great interest to the specific and shocking examples provided by the speakers. There are thousands of such examples, which merely confirm our feeling that we must translate our words into action and that we will not be able to resolve the problems in the European institutions alone, but that concerted action by all key players is necessary, including the NGOs working to protect minors and human dignity, at both European as well as national or regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report states, progress has already been made in a very short time. For example, associations of Internet Service Providers have been established in most Member States and the ISPs in most Member States are members of the European Internet Service Providers’ Association (EuroISPA), which has promoted the adoption of codes of conduct for the responsibility of providers. Hotlines have been set up in the vast majority of Member States to deal with complaints about illegal or offensive content.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is supporting the creation of these hotlines with its action plan for safer Internet use. According to the information provided by the Member States, it seems that the majority of Internet sites advocating political extremism or which depict sexual violence, and very many paedophile or pornographic sites are located outside the European Union, hence the importance of a strategy in this field that is not only European, but global.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the industry is also working on establishing classification and filtering systems, on the creation of protected areas or ‘walled gardens’; portals in which ISPs guarantee the quality of the sites to which they provide access. The Community action plan for safer Internet use is also encouraging these initiatives. There have certainly been some very positive experiences, but there have also been sites which are, unfortunately, appalling, and which cannot be effectively closed down.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the application of the recommendation by radio stations and television companies, all the Member States now have devices available which ensure that programmes likely to harm minors are preceded by a warning sound or have a symbol on the screen throughout the programme. We know full well that the times that are supposedly ‘closed’ to children no longer have any meaning today, because our children are perfectly capable of recording programmes that are broadcast whilst they are fast asleep. Furthermore, filter systems can only be used with digital television. It will, therefore, be easier to filter programmes when digital television is up and running, but for the moment, this is happening very slowly.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the Commission had a study produced on parental control of television programmes, which recommended giving the greatest emphasis to self-regulation whilst making filter devices available to families at an affordable price. I agree, on this point, with all Members of the House who approve of self-regulation, on condition that this is backed by legislation. This is the direction we must concentrate on in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to close by answering some specific questions raised by honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I shall address my comments to the rapporteur, Mr Beazely: it would be premature to present a new report by the end of 2002, but under the review, we shall take all of Parliament’s observations into account. We shall continue our work, but the report will probably not be ready by the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the system of classification, a new study on classification was started by my staff in January and should be completed by the second half of 2002. It will be forwarded to Parliament and we will discuss it and draw the relevant conclusions from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, media education: as I have said on many occasions, this is one of my competences, one of my objectives. Our children learn, to a greater or lesser degree, to read, write and to do arithmetic, but they never to learn to read and to gauge this society of images that surrounds them. This is why we have launched the first pilot projects for image education. This is also why the forthcoming ‘Net-Days’ in November 2002, which will link up hundreds of thousands of school classes in most of the Member States and, furthermore, in other parts of the world, will this year be dedicated to image education and image analysis. Our approach, therefore, is extremely practical.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that a single Commissioner, the European Parliament or the Commission alone cannot deal with all of these issues. This is why the proposals will be studied in conjunction with all the Commissioners responsible for the areas affected by this issue, and with institutions other than the Commission that have responsibility in this area, such as Europol, for example. What is needed is concerted action, which we shall continue to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
