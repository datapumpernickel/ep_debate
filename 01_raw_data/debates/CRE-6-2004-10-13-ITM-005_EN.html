<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I am going to talk about Georgia, a very important subject, and I am sure that the majority of the people here are very concerned about the situation there. From the outset of political change in Georgia, the European Union has been fully engaged with the new government and the new political leaders who have been in Georgia since the so-called ‘rose revolution’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you what we have done so far. Firstly, we have appointed a special representative, Mr Heikki Talvitie, who represents us in the region, and particularly in Georgia. The role he has played has been greatly appreciated by everybody, by President Saakashvili, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by the government as a whole, and by the countries of the region. He has been able to act as a link between Georgia and Russia, which, as you can imagine, is a very important element in the situation today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and very importantly, we have included Georgia and two other countries in the region, Azerbaijan and Armenia, in the neighbourhood policy. This has been the most important way in which we were able to help these countries move closer to the European Union. We did it rapidly, and you can imagine the happiness this decision has created for the people and leaders of Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the European Union has already organised a donors conference for Georgia. It was a success, right after the change in government. In July we launched the first ESDP operation for the rule of law in Georgia. It is working very well. It is an innovation, one of the many operations and actions the European Union can carry out among the whole panoply of capabilities we have for helping countries in transition.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Georgia is not good from an economic point of view. GDP has decreased by almost 60%, which is of very serious concern. 60% of the population are probably below the poverty line and there are still around 300 000 displaced persons as a result of the wars in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot finish talking about Georgia without talking about the conflicts and the problems facing the country. Georgia has solved one problem through the autonomy of Ajaria, but there are still two big problems which will not be solved so easily: the problem of South Ossetia and the problem of Abkhazia. The OECD has a role to play there. Mr Talvitie, representing us, will continue to work on that. But the solution of those problems will not be as simple and easy as the one I mentioned before, which was resolved quite smoothly through the autonomy process. This is going to be more difficult. It is going to require a good understanding of Russia. We are ready to play that role if necessary, but we have the impression that these two issues are going to take more time and will be more difficult. But in any case they have to be resolved. Without the resolution of the problem there, Georgia's integrity will never be a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word on regional cooperation. Georgia cannot be isolated from its two other neighbours in the southern Caucasus: Azerbaijan and Armenia. We have a relationship with the three countries. We would like to construct a relationship with the three countries which is vivid, which is important and which is close to the European Union and the European Union dream. I therefore want to say that President Saakashvili has the support of the European Union. It was clear from the very beginning that he had enormous problems in front of him. We are going to help him with the reforms he has to make internally and in Georgia's relations with neighbouring countries, in particular its relations with Russia, which will be highly important. As you know, there are still Russian troops in Georgia. President Saakashvili has said he will not accept forces from any other country in his territory and therefore he will give guarantees to the Russians that they can leave without the risk of any forces from any other country appearing in Georgia. Georgia has a difficult time ahead and needs the help of its friends. Here we are. We are friends of Georgia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, let me briefly address three questions. How far has Georgia come since the 'rose revolution' eleven months ago? How have we tried to assist Georgia in this process? What are the challenges ahead in EU–Georgia relations?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Georgia's achievements. Most importantly of course, all observers judged Georgia's presidential and parliamentary elections in January and March of this year to be the freest and fairest in Georgia's post-Soviet history. Georgia now has a president and government with a very strong popular mandate to carry out the profound political and economic reforms which we all know are so necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">A good start has been made in addressing the structural problems facing Georgia, tackling for example endemic corruption, which has harmed every facet of life in Georgia. Georgia's state finances have been put on a more stable path to recovery. Revenue collection has increased, allowing the Georgian Government to pay salaries on time. Reform of the law enforcement agencies has begun and a new tax code has been presented to the parliament. It is only a start, but Georgia has done well in the last eleven months.</p>
<p class="contents">How have we helped since November last year? Firstly, we have offered consistent political support to the new leadership and we have encouraged it along the path of reform. We have been in close touch with it and with the special representative, who has done such an excellent job. Only recently President Prodi visited Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan. It was the first visit to the South Caucasus by a Commission President and it visibly demonstrated earlier this month the Commission's support to Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also helped to mobilise significant international financial support for the reform agenda of the Georgian Government. Colleagues will be aware of the very successful conference that we co-hosted with the World Bank in June. It went very well. In June we doubled to EUR 137 million our commitment to Georgia over the years 2004 to 2006. So we have made a substantially increased contribution to supporting reform in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">The third way in which we have assisted Georgia is the inclusion of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the European neighbourhood policy. That has been widely supported throughout the House.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the challenges that lie ahead? Firstly, Georgia has got to keep up the pace of reform. Turning reform commitments into realities on the ground is, of course, the hardest job, particularly for a country such as Georgia whose state institutions have been so hollowed out, so weakened over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to work to exploit the possibilities opened up by the inclusion of the South Caucasus countries in the neighbourhood policy that I referred to. As far as Georgia is concerned, the onus will be on that country to demonstrate genuine commitment to achieving political and economic reform, which is the only way of guaranteeing Georgia’s long-term stability. That will be at the heart of the action plan which we hope in due course to negotiate with the Georgian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The other challenge is the conflicts on Georgia’s territory. We welcome – and this point was made by the High Representative – President Saakashvili’s statement at the UN General Assembly confirming Georgia’s commitment to solve the conflicts through solely peaceful means. Our position in the EU is clear: we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia; we call on all parties to work for solutions to the conflicts through negotiation, confidence-building and exclusively peaceful means. Our rehabilitation programmes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia can help to build confidence between the communities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential – if we are to solve conflicts and secure Georgia’s long-term stability – to see a serious improvement in the relations between Georgia and Russia. We hope that the presidents and governments of those countries can work to find solutions to the bilateral differences in full respect of each country’s sovereignty. From our perspective, the South Caucasus is an extremely important part of the common neighbourhood of the European Union and Russia. We will continue to place this region high on our bilateral dialogue with Russia. Our view, as you know, is that strong, stable and prosperous neighbours make the best neighbours. That is what we mean by working for a better common neighbourhood. I hope that is also the view of the government of the Russian Federation. That is the most sensible way of looking at methods of securing a peaceful Europe and European neighbourhood for the years that lie ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to my friend, the High Representative, for what he said which – to borrow a remark – my father would have greatly enjoyed and my mother would have believed. It has been a great pleasure working with Javier Solana over the last five years. It is true to say that even the most scholarly pedagogues and PhD students would have some difficulty in finding any issue on which it was possible to slip a piece of tissue paper between what the High Representative has said in the last five years and what I have said. It has been a pleasure to work with him. There is a lot of cynicism about politics, but I just want to underline that he has been a friend through these five years, he will remain a friend for the future, and I wish him the very best of luck as the Constitutional Treaty comes into place and he takes up the responsibilities of Foreign Minister. I wish my successors as European Commissioners responsible for the portfolio which I have enjoyed the best of good fortune as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to apologise to honourable Members for the fact that I cannot stay for the whole of this debate. I have a medical appointment which involves manipulation of my neck – though not in as permanent a way as some Members of the House might have wanted from time to time!</p>

Its people, who are our European neighbours, need this. For many years they suffered a Soviet dictatorship, after which they have had to endure internal conflict, foreign interference and corruption. We must support Georgia as a country which has affirmed its Euroatlantic aspirations and has already begun to take concrete steps to move closer to the principles and standards of the European Union. It may be that Georgia will have to choose one of the hard alternatives, if the two most important challenges appear too difficult to be solved simultaneously. Due to the well-known forced division of Georgia into one main and two separate <span class="italic">de facto</span> parts, the alternatives for this country are as follows: to either establish a European democracy in that part of Georgia which is loyal to and governed by Tbilisi, i.e. legislative power with a free economy and rights for minorities, or to endeavour to end the division as soon as possible, and to restore the legislative power and administrative control of the Georgian state throughout the country's entire territory. Of these tests, I would advise that that first challenge should be given priority – the building of a democratic state in the area which today is ruled by Georgia. However, Georgia's looking to the West, to its European neighbours and the European Union, also presents a test for the European Union. That is the principle of European openness. When we consider the Continent of Europe itself, which is home to the land of Antique legends and the Golden Fleece, Georgia is one of the oldest Christian states. May those countries which accept our ideals, move closer to us in all respects. And the goodwill of the European Union will encourage their progress. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very quickly, separatist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have managed, by dint of armed conflict, to wrest important parts of the country from central government control. Despite almost unceasing attempts by both the UN in Abkhazia and the OSCE in South Ossetia to reach a peaceful political settlement of these conflicts, not a great deal of progress has been made to date. The continued existence of these hotbeds of conflict constitutes a permanent threat to stability in Georgia. The outbreaks of fighting in South Ossetia in August of this year are only a poignant illustration of this, as are the unlawful, so-called presidential elections in Abkhazia, which jeopardise the development of democracy in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to today’s topic, I should like to make a few more general remarks about the role of the European Union. We support the line as set out by Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, and other Members of this House will undoubtedly make more detailed remarks. After eight new Member States from Central Europe joined the European Union, the problems of the neighbouring countries, particularly the states that were once part of the Soviet Union, have drawn a lot closer to us. With Romania’s imminent accession, the lingering conflict over Moldavia about the separation of Transnistria will form a continuing threat to safety and stability at one of the EU’s new external borders. I can assure you that the situation in Transnistria is very similar to that in Georgia. These developments give us no choice but to follow what is going on in the countries around us much more closely. The European Union is required to shoulder much greater responsibility to a far greater extent than before in order to reinforce democracy and stability in those countries. It follows that a sudden outbreak of conflicts and a permanent suppression of human rights on our doorstep constitutes a threat to stability and democracy in the Member States of the EU itself. The conclusion of partnership and cooperation agreements and the development by the Commission of the strategy for the new neighbours and the action plans ensuing from this were a first step in the direction of shouldering this greater responsibility. On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would urge the Commission and Council to promptly translate these initiatives into concrete measures, both in the field of reinforcing democracy and in the field of a thorough reform of economic and social policy in the relevant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s responsibility will need to go further than that, though. It will also need to include greater involvement in looking for a peaceful solution to the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and not only there, but also in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh. The European Union cannot manage to do this on its own. It will need to seek an alliance with Russia, but the Russian Government will also need to stop playing a dual role in many of those conflict areas; it is unacceptable that Russia should act as an intermediary while at the same time siding with, and supporting, one of the parties involved in the conflicts, whether this be in Transnistria or in Georgia. For the European Union, this is not about wanting to elbow Russia out of that part of Europe and extending its own geostrategic interest in Eastern Europe. The European Union – where possible in tandem with Russia – has an interest in establishing peace, stability, economic and social progress on or near its borders. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sheer lawlessness and the need for stronger law and order; the need for the Russian troops to fulfil their promise and withdraw; the need above all for tolerance between neighbouring peoples in the South Caucasus, to adopt the EU model – the way of learning to live in peace and tolerance and respecting each other, which they have to do.

They aspire to better living conditions and political stability and to seeing corruption fought and a state established that is governed by the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This new impetus must not weaken, and we all have a responsibility for supporting this peaceful movement. The escalation in violence, together with the killings and woundings condemned last summer in South Ossetia show the extent to which Georgia, like the whole of this Southern Caucasus region, remains fragile and in danger of tipping over into armed conflict. This fear is, unfortunately, exacerbated by recent statements by the Russian authorities, who might carry out pre-emptive strikes in the Southern Caucasus under the banner of their security doctrine. We condemned such strikes in Iraq, and we condemn them in this case. Russia remains, however, in a key position to resolve these regional conflicts, and not only in Georgia. It cannot, however, continue to engage in double-dealing by, on the one hand, supporting the international community in its efforts to help the Georgian authorities establish a state governed by the rule of law and, on the other hand, supporting the Abkhazian and Ossetian separatists by, for example, granting them Russian passports or opening the railway line linking Soukhumi and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question is simple: what are the undertakings that the European Union intends to request of Russia in order to bring about a lasting resolution in this region of the conflicts that have died down but that have not been resolved? The EU’s commitment in this region has certainly been stepped up, as you said, in the form of the EU’s Special Representative and the Rule of Law Mission to Georgia – a first, as you emphasised. The urgency of the situation is such, however, that the EU needs to go further. It must prepare a genuine road map for its representative, who might serve as a facilitator or negotiator in successfully bringing about a peaceful resolution of the conflicts. His help might, for example, be valuable at the next meeting between Georgian prime minister Mr Jvania and the separatist leader of South Ossetia, Mr Kokoity. Georgia is one piece of a giant Caucasian puzzle, and these countries, let us not forget, are European countries. They will be the last candidates for joining a successfully completed EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the other issue is that of integration. Is the EU to remain deaf to the public request made by Mr Saakashvili, President of Georgia, for integration with the European Union? That is a serious and legitimate question. We shall not be satisfied with a commitment to the New Neighbourhood policy whereby we, the European Parliament, have forced the hand of the Council with regard to integrating the Southern Caucasus into that new neighbourhood. Let us not leave these countries alone in facing the issue of European borders. Mr Solana, can we open the doors to the Balkans and close them to the Caucasus? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The head of the Georgian state was elected on 4 January 2004, when President Saakashvili received a democratic mandate unprecedented in our part of the world. He has important tasks ahead of him, which involve reform of the state and not merely the restoration of Georgia’s territorial integrity. President Saakashvili’s mandate is also a time of great hope for the entire Georgian people. As a representative of Poland, I am well aware of the immense difficulty involved in sustaining such hope, yet hope is necessary to carry out reforms as important as those which await Georgia. I was particularly interested in Mr Patten’s comments on placing the issue of support for Georgia and President Saakashvili’s ambitions on the agenda for bilateral talks with Russia. I believe we should adopt a very determined approach during these talks, as Russia’s position is key to solving Georgia’s problems in the near future. It is also crucial to resolving a situation which, as can be seen from our motion for a resolution, we all agree is at stalemate, despite all the efforts of the international community. We would like the pressure exerted by Russia to be reduced somewhat, and for cooperation with separatists both ... </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder what sort of peace the Americans are building by training Georgian soldiers there, and who is currently benefiting from this oil pipeline project. In the European Union, we teach the rule of law, not how to fire a gun, and this difference should always be made clear to our friends. The elections that were held were a good example of progress. Special envoy Heikki Talvitie has done a good job there, but the Caucasus region shows all the symptoms of deepening and continuing conflicts: ethnic, economic, religious, military and political.</p>

<p class="contents">The continuing conflict in Georgia concerns us all, because it creates the conditions for the destabilisation of the Caucasus as a whole, with repercussions on the strategic security interests of the European Union and its Member States, the Balkans and the south-eastern Mediterranean and Middle East as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the energy-related risks in the area, the European Union should immediately take specific initiatives to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Within this framework, convening an international conference under the aegis of the UN might help in finding a peaceful and diplomatic solution. At the same time, the European Union should work out specific initiatives within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy and make its strategic presence in the area more visible. Strategic planning is required, together with strong economic aid in the form of assistance from the European Investment Bank and preferential trade relations with Georgia and the other countries in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">Developments in Georgia also concern Greece, because thousands of citizens of Greek descent live in Georgia in a state of insecurity. Greece has taken important initiatives at bilateral level over recent years to fund infrastructure projects in the sectors of health, education and cultural and educational exchanges, in order to build a democratic civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by highlighting the crucial role played by Russia in the area. The European Union needs to dynamically integrate relations with the Caucasus into political dialogue with Russia. At the same time, we need to express our constant opposition to the stand of the Putin administration on preventive military intervention, just as we have consistently done on the US doctrine of the Bush administration. This stand jeopardises peace because it feeds conflict, it feeds the vicious circle of terrorism and organised crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise three points that, in my opinion, are significant and important. Political reforms are needed, and we need to support these. We also need to cooperate with these countries concerning economic reforms, particularly in Georgia. Finally, we need to help them resolve regional problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, to emphasise two other points in particular: first of all, relations with Russia, as several of you mentioned. I can tell you that the issue of relations with the countries of the region is raised at all the meetings we have with our Russian friends, and at all levels; with President Putin, Minister Ivanov and everyone. I can tell you that, at the meetings in New York, we talked in depth with our Russian friends and examined from all angles and in all ways the issue of the countries bordering upon Russia and the enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise the role of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which no one has mentioned. The OSCE is the organisation that is qualified to manage the issues between these regions and that also has responsibility for implementing the commitments of the Istanbul declaration concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia in particular. My friend Mr Wiersma talked about this.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, I can tell you that we are all in agreement as to the need to cooperate with these countries and to provide them with all the political and economic aid they need. These countries, with their European values, belong in Europe. For the time being, however, we must continue to operate within the framework of the neighbourhood policy and continue to make use of all the opportunities afforded to us by this mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
