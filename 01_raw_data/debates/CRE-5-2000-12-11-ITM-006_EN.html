<p class="contents">They include the action plan to combat cancer, the programme of action for the prevention of AIDS, the programme of action for the prevention of drug dependence and the action plan to promote health and, if they are suspended, it will mean an end to the projects and the work being carried out by the networks which have been set up. The codecision procedure to implement the new public health action plans for 2001-2006 cannot be completed by 12 December 2000, when 4 out of the 6 programmes expire, which is why we urgently need to agree to their being extended, initially by one year and then by a second year if the new action programme has not yet entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, I agree with the rapporteur's proposal to speed up the procedures and avoid two readings by reaching an agreement with the Council and the Commission on the budget lines in question. I trust that we shall not have to deal again with this sort of delay in such vital areas as public health in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Τrakatellis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, may I start by pointing out that the programmes which it is proposed to extend, four programmes for two years' training and two programmes for one year's training, are directly related to the new health programme which is currently being discussed in the Committee on the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the new programme, which will run from 2001 to 2006, is still not ready and is not expected to enter into force for some time. Consequently, the request for an extension to the previous programmes – important programmes on cancer, AIDS, diseases such as pollution-related diseases or the monitoring of infectious diseases, i.e. programmes which are of tremendous significance to public health in general – was a logical step. If they are not extended, we shall have a huge gap in public health issues and programmes. We must not forget that the essence of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>from these programmes needs to be passed on to the new health programmes currently being drawn up and it is therefore only right that we extend them.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have agreed with the Council and the Commission and, of course, with Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, so as to avoid a second reading and allow these programmes to continue without a break, thereby avoiding any gaps, is to extend the four programmes by two years, as the Commission has requested; however, the money will only be released a year at a time, so that if the new health programme is approved and enters into force in the meantime, there will be no need for an extension and the money can be used for the second year. If, of course, the new programme has not yet begun, which I do not believe will be the case, then we shall, of course, carry on and use the money for the second year. So that is what we have agreed; we have agreed that the two programmes which expire in December 2001 will be extended for one year and we have also agreed on the amount, which is the same, in fact it is slightly less than the amount which the European Commission originally requested.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have, I think, proceeded very quickly and with excellent cooperation. I would even go so far as to say that we may well have inaugurated a new <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>for codecision issues. Instead of waiting for conciliation, which takes a very long time, we have, to all intents and purposes, dealt with the conciliation in advance, a method which I would recommend to the European Commission, the Council and the parliamentary committees. What a good idea to be able to prepare the way, to proceed as far down the line as possible, to be so close that, even if we need a second reading, we are already within a hair's breadth of a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, of course, like to thank all my colleagues, and the other groups, and of course I should like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, because we had a valuable convergence of opinion and were able to proceed quickly so as to avoid any gaps in the public health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that we shall proceed in the same manner and will use the same method for the new health programme, so that we really can make headway on these issues, and that the European integration which we talk of, constantly telling ourselves that it is not something abstract, is not the sort of integration which only applies to external relations and defence issues. It is a series of convergences. It is impossible to conceive of a unified European Union without convergence in the health sector and in the education and other sectors. So I feel that, slowly but surely, we are making headway. Of course, we know that the health sector is still the responsibility of the Member States, but the Treaties do, of course, give the European Commission a great deal of responsibility for the public health of European citizens. So we are moving in the right direction. I see these programmes as the first signs of convergence, a convergence which should be a straightforward task, because European citizens stand to gain a great deal from action in the public health sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Trakatellis: you cannot play games with patients’ health when they expect our help, or with non-governmental organisations which need these Community budgets to deliver the health policies on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, it is high time the Member States agreed to give the European Union a greater margin of manoeuvre and a more substantial budget, on a legitimately supranational issue: diseases know no frontiers. Above all, a framework programme should not forget the specific actions on the pretext of refocusing. For example, even if the fight against AIDS is not fashionable, it still needs to be a priority because this tragic disease remains very present, particularly in the future candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we hold that the goal of a future European strategy must be the incorporation of health issues into all the other Community policies, so as to put an end to current anomalies, like allocating 50 million euros to the fight against cancer while subsidising the tobacco industry to the tune of one billion! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that, as Mr Trakatellis very effectively pointed out, we need to make arrangements in order to move ahead with the implementation of programmes in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Since all of Europe’s citizens are being affected by common problems relating to food, work, and various issues, it makes sense for there to be common European programmes which are becoming increasingly important in the joint combating, prevention, awareness and action in relation to these issues. It is therefore desirable that the efforts dedicated to these matters should increase.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely on this issue that we believe there is a notable lack of direction in the European Union, in the Council and the Commission, which, with the budgetary cuts – not wanting to reach the ceiling of 1.27% which the regulations in force currently allow – is harming actions such as these at a time when coordination between the different Member States is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the need stated in Mr Trakatellis’s report to balance the different programmes and actions which are underway. Furthermore, we must take account of the fact that prevention and promotion as well as monitoring are all going to be increasingly important and therefore they should be given more resources and a higher profile.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we believe that we should try to ensure that, in the future, situations such as this do not recur, with a lack of speed on the part of the Commission in providing for the renewal of all actions on time. This is a worrying state of affairs, which has caused concern amongst the many organisations involved and the problem should be resolved once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The continuation of certain public health programmes until the end of 2002 will cost EUR 80 million. This will mean that Community action can be taken in the area of health promotion, information, education and training, the combat cancer programme, the programme for Community action for the prevention of AIDS and certain other communicable diseases, and the prevention of drug dependence.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European institutions, primarily the European Commission and Parliament, should be given broader powers to promote the health programmes within the European Union. Certainly, the European Community action programme for the prevention of AIDS has done much to reduce the number of people contracting this awful disease within the European Union. Indeed, I intend to play a central and active role in ensuring that increased funds will be made available for cancer research within the Union. It is imperative that this budget is increased so that we can ultimately find out the cause of cancer and cure those who contract it.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevention of drug dependence programmes must also be focused not only on black spots, but across many other areas within the European Union. International organisations such as Europol have estimated that the importation of drugs into the Union is actually increasing. So the battle to defeat international drug trafficking and to defeat the importation of drugs into the Union is still a very real challenge for the years ahead. The Irish Government runs a very successful programme called "The Young People Facilities and Services Fund" which supports the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas. It targets those areas experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, significant drug problems. This is an area that can be looked at in the context of the new Community health programme which is due to come on stream.</p>

<p class="contents">We can read the basic principles for European public health policy in Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam: “Community action, which shall complement national policies. (…). Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges.” I would also like to refer to the principle of subsidiarity, which stipulates that non cross-border tasks should be performed by the Member States. As I see it though, efforts have been made recently to raise the profile of public health as a relevant and fundamental topic for Europe, although this development is at odds with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">European public health policy only comes into play if there is a cross-border issue involved or if Member States cannot implement a particular task in isolation. Relevant examples include legislation concerning cross-border trade in human organs, tissue and blood, and the programme for orphan drugs. Since the Member States need each other where the aforementioned examples are concerned, I am in favour of a common European approach in such cases. There is no need for this when it comes to tackling problems such as cancer, AIDS and drug addiction. A European approach does not lend a great deal of added value over and above the efforts undertaken by the Member States. Certainly, when it comes to the provision of information and raising awareness, action at national level is to be preferred over that at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union could do more in the way of raising health standards for the candidate countries, where even basic health care is lacking. In addition, relatively straightforward illnesses cannot be treated owing to lack of funds and other resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also perturbed by the fact that the various healthcare systems of the European Union will come up for discussion in new proposals soon to be on the agenda. It is possible that national systems will be called into question in the process, or even adversely affected in the future, which I think would be an undesirable development.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, Madam President, I must say the developments in the public health sector in the European Union go too far for my liking. Public health is national policy and should stay that way. I therefore do not support public health programmes that can be used as a stepping stone to erode national policy, when the programmes currently on the table scarcely provide anything over and above what the Member States themselves can offer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an example of how much can be achieved when all the institutions work well together.</p>
<p class="contents">The text being agreed today on the extension of six public health programmes reflects what has been informally agreed between the institutions. The Commission can therefore accept all the amendments put forward by Mr Trakatellis. I understand that the Council has also signalled its agreement in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension is important for two reasons. First, it will enable some important public health activities to continue and to fulfil their objectives. Second, it provides us with the necessary breathing space in which we can take forward the discussions on our proposed new public health programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just reassure you about one thing. The work to be carried out in the extended programmes, and indeed all current health programmes, will be geared towards preparing some of the key actions foreseen by the new programme. Within the framework of the individual programme decisions, their work programmes will be adapted to these needs. As far as the text in front of you is concerned, I now hope that once it is voted by Parliament the decision will be adopted by the Health Council on 14 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
