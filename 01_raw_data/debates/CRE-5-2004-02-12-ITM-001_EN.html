<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brie (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you have ever visited Afghanistan or endeavoured to become more deeply informed about it, you will know how appalling and how extensive is the damage that has been done there – materially, culturally, socially and in human terms. Civil wars, the power struggles of local warlords, the Soviet war of occupation, the Taliban dictatorship, and the Northern Alliance’s bombardments too have killed and maimed millions, destroyed the economy of what was already an extremely poor country and left much of its society in ruins.</p>
<p class="contents">For centuries, Afghanistan was the plaything of foreign powers’ strategic interests. In my view, the present situation is above all the consequence of the wars sparked off by the Soviet invasion, and of the USA’s short-sighted policies, both of which gave the Taliban real military and political power in Afghanistan. The victims have always been Afghan women, children and men – in their millions.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, however, is not meant to be about our differences on the past – although we certainly have them – but about our common position that the international community must take responsibility for providing, on a massive scale, political, financial and economic support for the people of Afghanistan in shaping a peaceful, democratic and social future for themselves. This aid, and the financial support provided by the Commission in particular, must not be cut back; it must be stepped up to take account of the prevailing conditions. It would be irresponsible of the international community, in the shadow of the war in Iraq and of the tragic difficulties there, to backtrack on its commitment to Afghanistan and weaken its solidarity with its people. I believe that it is precisely because of the situation in Iraq and the unilateralist approach to it that Afghanistan must be one of the international community’s successes, on the basis of the UN Charter and with a pivotal role for the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant and positive changes have been made since the Taliban were ousted. This has been principally to the credit of the political forces in Afghanistan itself. The constitution that has just been adopted is a particularly important indicator of progress, guaranteeing as it does fundamental democratic and human rights, doing justice to all ethnic groups and stressing equal treatment for women and men – the latter being immensely significant not only in view of the overthrown regime’s brutal oppression of women and girls, but also in view of the fact that the situation remains totally unsatisfactory today, with women and girls still at a massive disadvantage, excluded from participation in many aspects of social life and with dreadful violence against women a fact of day-to-day life, with thousands of incidents. The international community must, as we do in our report, demand universal human rights, with women’s rights included among them. Whilst not adopting an imperial approach to doing this, it must be consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these – and other – advances, the situation in Afghanistan is extremely volatile. The most pressing problems are the non-existent or minimal security in many regions, the potential for conflict inherent in the unbroken military might of warlords, governors and drug traffickers; the disarmament process has ground to a halt, it is proving difficult to demobilise soldiers from the private armies and reintegrate them into society, the Taliban are regrouping in some parts of the south and south-east of the country and there has been a dramatic increase in opium poppy cultivation and in drug trafficking. As these problems must not be allowed to prevent the forthcoming presidential elections being conducted successfully, I appeal to all Members of this House, and especially to those belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, not to support the amendments seeking to delete the description of these problems. Were we to do that, we would, I believe, be doing the people of Afghanistan no favours, nor would we be doing ourselves any if we want to keep Afghanistan as an international policy priority. Let me also remind you in this regard that, when we recently honoured the Secretary-General of the UN by awarding him and his organisation the Sakharov Prize, we did so in memory of the UN personnel killed in Iraq; the warning of a worsening security situation given as recently as 15 January by Lakhdar Brahimi, who was at the time the UN’s special envoy in Afghanistan and is now its special envoy in Iraq, must be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee, and all the groups. I believe that we had a common will to make clear how much Afghanistan is a priority. Many thanks also to the EU Commission, to its staff in Kabul and to Francesc Vendrell, its special representative there. </p>

But I would like to say how much I agreed with the rest of it, particularly what he said about the continuing priority that we must give to Afghanistan. I also agree very strongly with what he said about the commitment, the dedication and the courage of some of those who are implementing our programmes in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss Afghanistan in the week before I go there again and in the run-up to the most challenging goal set in the Bonn Agreement of 2001 – the free and fair election of a democratic government in Afghanistan. There was enormous optimism at Bonn about building a strong and democratic Afghanistan, and delivering a peace dividend to the whole population. Since then there have been huge strides forward, but there are still formidable challenges ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year I suggested that Afghanistan was at a critical crossroads and that the international community should redouble its efforts to help President Karzai extend his authority across the country. It is increasingly clear that this also means stamping out opium poppy production. The 2003 UN opium poppy survey makes extremely disturbing reading: not only has production risen by 6% from the bumper levels seen in 2002, but cultivation has spread into new areas – it now affects almost 90% of provinces. This pernicious trade – valued at about EUR 2.5 billion – undermines the efforts to build a functioning plural democratic state and also fuels ongoing instability and conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">But before discussing how the international community is working with the Afghan Government to tackle this, I would like to highlight what Afghanistan has achieved in the last twelve months. Firstly, a new constitution – which recognises women as equal to men – has been agreed by the Constitutional Loya Jirga. Next, the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration has started, and there have been some encouraging early results on the reduction of heavy arms in Kabul and the Panshir valley. There has also been a start to the election registration process, though we need to speed up the pace.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, GDP growth raced ahead by 30% in 2002, with a figure of 20% expected in 2003. The new currency introduced in late 2002 has remained stable and the Afghan Government has succeeded in increasing the flow of tax revenues to Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has also continued 'to do more' than we promised at Tokyo. Total European Union commitments in 2003 exceeded EUR 835 million, of which just over EUR 300 million came from the Commission. As in 2002, over 70% of the Commission’s support has been contracted in year, which is an impressive track record by any standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s development programme has ensured that health services are delivered in six provinces, covering 20% of the population; travel times on the Kabul-Jalalabad road have already been cut by up to half, and work to fully reconstruct the road is now beginning. Key public sector workers – including doctors, teachers and the police – are back at work. The rural economy continues to grow, reflecting the provision of improved seed, animal vaccination and the widespread rehabilitation of irrigation structures. De-mining continues to enable people to return to their own homes. In addition, funding from ECHO of EUR 127 million has helped to support the return of 2.5 million refugees to Afghanistan since 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Afghanistan’s future depends critically on security. The escalating violence in 2003 has, as the honourable Member said, claimed the lives of aid workers, ISAF troops and many Afghan citizens. It has left large parts of the south and south-east off limits for international staff. By the end of 2003, EUR 13 million of Commission projects in high-risk areas had been temporarily suspended. We must recognise that insecurity and burgeoning opium poppy production are two sides of the same coin. Without better security, reconstruction will certainly stall, and we will find ourselves struggling to hold open and credible elections. So I strongly welcome Member States' engagement in the Provincial Reconstruction Teams, as well as their continued support to ISAF. I strongly hope that NATO will be able to provide more troops.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the role that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom are playing in helping the Afghan Government to build an efficient army, police force, and judicial system, as well as to implement an effective anti-narcotics policy. Without stronger institutions and better law enforcement, we will get nowhere in the fight against drugs. This is exactly why the Commission committed an extra EUR 50 million to support the police in late 2003, and why we will continue to play our part in delivering security, including tackling opium production.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure the House is aware, in May 2003 the Afghan Government adopted a robust anti-narcotics policy embracing alternative livelihoods, institution building, effective law enforcement and demand reduction. The Commission has worked closely with the Afghan Government, the UK – the lead donor on anti-narcotics – and the UN to help develop and implement this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, in 2003 the Commission committed EUR 9 million to promote alternative livelihoods in the Eastern region; EUR 3 million to reinforce border control along the Afghan-Iran border; and EUR 65.5 million to support the police in delivering effective law enforcement across Afghanistan. In addition, the wider EUR 100 million committed for rural development for 2003-2004 will help to provide long-term legitimate employment for those currently involved in poppy production. This underlines the huge importance we attach to curbing the drug economy. I have asked Commission services to report back on how this will be taken forward following the Drugs Conference a few days ago on 8 and 9 February. I hope to have substantive discussions on this when I return to Kabul with the Ministerial Troika next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Building a secure Afghanistan will not be achieved overnight. We all know that the road ahead is far from easy. But we cannot afford to let reconstruction fail in Afghanistan and it is critical that the international community underlines its strong and continued support for President Karzai at the upcoming International Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by thanking this House for its unwavering commitment to Afghanistan, especially as regards the budget. I look forward to building on this over the coming year and to informing the House, in due course, of the conclusions I arrive at after my next visit to Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is home to over 30 different ethnic groups, among them Pashtoons, Hasara and Tajiks, who co-exist in an equilibrium that has developed over history, but is very unstable. It is thus clear to us all that Afghanistan’s problems can be resolved only if proposed solutions and aid programmes are in harmony with Afghan culture and history. As the rapporteur said, the situation of women in Afghanistan is particularly tragic. The rate of maternal mortality is among the highest in the world; that is also the case for deaths of infants and children. According to official estimates the incidence of illiteracy among Afghan women stands at 90%. I believe that the position of women can be improved only if we involve the men. Women cannot be helped without persuading their husbands, fathers, brothers and their clan chiefs as well. If we want to help Afghan women, we have to respect their culture, and, in a country in which women have endured years of oppression, it is the men to whom it has to be explained that, if things are good for their wives and children, then they will be all right too and so society as a whole is better off.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, women and men must be accorded the same rights. It is also important that we should build schools for girls – and for boys too – so that there can be some changes in the way they think. Reference has been made to the Afghan constitution, which accords equal rights to women and men, and which prohibits discrimination of any kind. As it gets involved, the European Union should continue to respect all this and allow its aid measures to benefit the population as a whole. I wish to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation on this issue and am behind both him and the Commission in their conviction that Afghanistan must continue to be a priority on our political agenda if the people who live there are to be helped.</p>

<p class="contents">Since 2001 and following the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan, with the aid of the European Union and with international assistance, has had to face numerous challenges in order to ensure, on the one hand, its physical reconstruction and, on the other, its political reconstruction. I am clearly delighted with the adoption of a new Constitution for Afghanistan, on 4 January, by the Loya Jirga. This new Constitution marks a step forward on the road to democracy, as well as being a fundamental condition for the organisation of the future presidential and legislative elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the reconstruction to become a reality, however, and for the political process to be a success, a secure environment is necessary, so that the governmental bodies, the agents of international assistance and civil society can combine their efforts to reconstruct the country's infrastructures and civil institutions. There will be no reconstruction without security. That is why we must support the establishment of future provincial reconstruction teams, PRTs, which should soon be deployed outside Kabul. These teams will have the task of ensuring security, but also helping in the reconstruction of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Our support must extend to the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into civilian life. Finally, we must support the Afghan Government in its fight against opium growing, with a view to helping it to find effective alternative solutions. We must be aware that opium production has increased by 6% since 2002, which means that the country is the world's biggest supplier with 77% of world production.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union and the international community must continue to actively support the numerous NGOs which, despite the climate of insecurity, provide considerable assistance to the Afghan population. Within this humanitarian framework, we must encourage implementation of prevention centres and help centres for women, expectant mothers and children. In fact, even though we must take pleasure in the reference to equal treatment in the new Constitution, we all know that the situation of women is fragile and that respect for their fundamental rights will only be achieved with the help of the international community and as a result of intensive information and education campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan needs financial aid and logistical support from the European Union now more than ever. The democratic process has begun, but it remains fragile. It is important that the Commission quickly mobilises the necessary resources to ensure effective financial aid. That is why I believe that the creation of the European agency for reconstruction in Afghanistan, similar to the one implemented in Kosovo, should receive our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I would like to remind you that we owe a debt to Afghanistan. For many years we have been absent when that country needed us. It is now our responsibility to do everything to help Afghanistan finally live in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United Nations Security Council agreed to the military action aimed at eliminating the terrorist bases where the attacks against the United States in Kenya, in Yemen, in New York and in Washington had been promoted. Also unlike secular Iraq, the Afghanistan of the Taliban had taken the form of a retrograde clerical State in which one of the worst forms of repression consisted of reducing women to the status of nonentity.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these clear differences, there are certain similarities between the economic and political reconstructions of Iraq and of Afghanistan. As in Iraq, in Afghanistan there is also increasing insecurity, which obliges civilian and military personnel, both indigenous and foreign, to dedicate much of their efforts to their own protection. Afghanistan and Iraq are both countries with a tribal structure where local bosses and ethnic and religious leaders only want to take the biggest slice of the national cake. In the past, national unity was only guaranteed by means of a dictatorship, and foreigners or occupying forces are not considered as allies unless they serve the interests of a certain clan chief. But as time passes, their presence is becoming more and more embarrassing, and at any time irritation may turn to hate, with a war of liberation just around the corner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brie report on Afghanistan brings us face to face with this reality by reminding us of certain essential truths, including the need to speed up the pace of reform and reconstruction. It rightly criticises the ambiguities of the new Constitution adopted by the tribal grand council, particularly with regard to the restriction of freedom of expression and the situation of women. When in 2004 we still see the shadows of women imprisoned in their burkas wandering amongst the ruins and the misery, the advantages over the previous regime are not at all obvious. The challenge of nation building is far from being won. Nevertheless, like our rapporteur I believe that, for the moment, the United Nations, the European Union and NATO have no choice but to continue their efforts to apply great courage to constructing a democratic Afghanistan which respects the rights of men and women. It is essential to establish decentralised institutions and the withdrawal of foreign troops. It is then up to Afghanistan to take control of its own destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Taliban regime was destroyed at that time, but that involved a genuine civil war and consequently exiles, displaced persons and a series of destructions of the country’s structures. What is the situation today? Afghanistan is a country that needs not just political and social reconstruction but also economic reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the report which the European Union's special representative in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, presented to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy around a year ago. He had the experience of having been a United Nations delegate to Afghanistan and he described to us the lack of security in the majority of the territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Today Afghanistan has an extremely serious problem with the drugs trade. The trade is estimated, as Commissioner Patten has said, to stand at USD 2.5 million per year, which is equivalent to approximately half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product. We hear about 70 000 to 80 000 hectares of cultivation by the bosses who control the territory, cultivation which is not restricted to raw production, since there are also ‘refining’ plants so that the drug can be exported directly.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), two-thirds of the world’s heroin is produced in Afghanistan. This naturally creates serious problems in the country and, in this regard, I hope the support of the European Union and the international community can continue with a view to eradicating consumption as well, which, as the Commissioner has said, is the other face of the existing insecurity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contains absolutely everything we may wish to find, and so it is a pleasure to read and support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to stress that we have made women the emblem of the oppression of the Afghan people. We have made women the emblem of the fight against the Taliban. Will we make women the emblem of the reconstruction of Afghanistan? That is not certain and therefore – as was said on comparing the situation in Afghanistan with that in Iraq just now – at times of war or liberation, in certain countries, the issue of women arises and becomes particularly acute. In this regard, the situation of Iraqi women is alarming. So why do we not focus on the issue of women today in Afghanistan?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has had an exchange of letters with you in relation to the attention paid to the issue of women within the framework of reconstruction and in relation to the proportion of aid earmarked by the European Union for this issue. We wanted 20%. I realise that this is enormous and that the figure is perhaps rather arbitrary. In fact, it appears that 2% is allocated to this chapter. Mainstreaming, above all in the field of health, certainly plays its role to the full, and so we are not going to talk about figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, what really amazes me, as well as the scant importance attached to the issue of women, is above all the absence of an education dossier in the Commission's work and in the budget lines proposed. Everybody knows that the issue of education, and in particular the education of girls, is essential within the context of women as an emblem of reconstruction. That was the first comment I wanted to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that we are certainly very happy with the mention of the principle of equality between men and women in the Constitution. We ourselves are fighting, in this House, for this principle to be present in the European Constitution. It follows that this issue does not only arise over in Afghanistan, but here as well. We are very well aware, here, that a principle is not sufficient, that it needs to be applied. We are happy with what has just happened in Morocco in relation to women's rights, but we are waiting for it to be applied. The same is clearly true for Afghanistan as it is for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, it gives a good account of the problems with the new constitution. It makes it clear that there are good reasons for possibly delaying the elections by a few months, and emphasises once again the need to further improve the situation of women. The tragedy is, however, that, with this report in our hands and the Commission’s good intentions, we have sadly found ourselves in a position where we may well be full of good intentions and have excellent plans, but neither the European Parliament nor even the European Commission has any influence on the circumstances under which those plans have to be carried out, namely the lack of security. There is a growing number of reports from NGOs stating that twelve aid workers were killed last year, for example. A growing number of reports from NGOs reveal that there is a very large number of good projects that they are unable to carry out. The Commissioner, too, referred to EUR 30 million of projects that, sadly, cannot be carried out owing to the lack of security.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, we have once more seen the newspapers full of splendid plans for rapid reaction forces. That is great when it comes to preventing bloodshed in Africa, but it must not be at the expense of less sexy projects, so to speak, such as the difficult development work in Afghanistan. After all, the Member States of the European Union now have a good deal to say for themselves in the way of promises, magnificent things that should be done, but soldiers are not going there, they are going there far too little, and that is the key problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are hardly any fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats still here, but I should like to call them to account on a mistake they made in December, in my view. They convinced Parliament that we should cut the aid to Afghanistan – yes, you heard right – because drug trafficking is not being tackled. The fact that drug trafficking is not being tackled is a direct consequence of the omission on the part of EU Member States to send any troops to Afghanistan, which contributes to dependence on warlords for the maintenance of order by such troops as are there, and consequently makes those troops reluctant to tackle opium trafficking. We must avoid a situation where we fail to keep our promises again, where Afghanistan sinks into an opium economy, led by warlords, and – my greatest concern – where the hopes of many Afghans, particularly Afghan women, are dashed once again. We must not allow this to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In it, the author, a widely travelled veteran Afghanistan journalist, turns the common Western image of Kabul and its environs on its head. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you can be assured that the present report has prompted me to reflect on this a good deal. I should like to summarise the article for you, therefore, and add a question about our strategy in Afghanistan. I also hope to give the article to the Commissioner later on, and that he has time to peruse it.</p>
<p class="contents">This journalist, John Jennings, disproves the spectre of the Afghan countryside as an Oriental Wild West on the basis of his own observations. With a few localised exceptions, he sees a safe, peaceful society; in short, no local warlords constantly making life unbearable for each other and the population. On the contrary, he sees encouraging signs of reconstruction, and also the return of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. In the opinion of Jennings, that huge majority of ordinary Afghans living in areas not actively contested by Taliban remnants have it better today than at any time since 1978.</p>
<p class="contents">Interim President Karzai should have every interest in this. To look at the scenario Jennings describes, however, the reverse seems to be true: with the help of ISAF and NATO, the technocrats in Kabul are seeking the military and political removal of the anti-Taliban groups in the provinces. It is precisely that Pashtoon agenda that gives rise to the very real danger of a general revolt against a regime imposed from outside: an Afghan tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">In Jennings’s view, it would be much more beneficial to the future of Afghanistan as a nation state to construct carefully and gradually from the bottom up, and to achieve political consensus among the <span class="italic">de facto </span>regional authorities, which do, after all, sanction a weak central authority. Interfering with this fragile process would give the Taliban and their anti-Western Pakistani patrons a second chance. This would mean an out-and-out defeat for the West in the fight against Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 12 and 13 of this report reveal that my colleague Mr Brie recognises the acute problem, this area of tension. Unfortunately, he does not enter into a more in-depth exploration of this fundamental problem regarding Afghanistan’s future as a nation: this issue is subordinated. We shall have to make do with that. What are the views of the Council and the Commission in this regard? I should like to bring this article to the attention of Commissioner Patten, particularly given his plans to set off for Kabul in the near future. I shall hand it to you later on. After all, no small matter is involved: a fair, sensible international strategy towards a breeding ground for international terrorist networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Things are not looking too good in Afghanistan at the moment. It is rumoured that Taliban groups in the south are making mighty advances, one hears – as the Russian defence minister, Mr Ivanov, said in Munich last week – that the cultivation of drugs has increased nine times over since the war began, and we see how soldiers from Europe, who are supposed to be working for the country’s future security, are unable to take action against it. It appears that they were watching over the drug routes along which the drugs find their way to Europe and to our children. To my mind, this is a very problematic situation and is the reason why it is urgently necessary that we should make every effort to facilitate the establishment of the rule of law and of democracy under a strong and guaranteed central power that also takes account of ethnic differences and of diversity. There will be no peace in Afghanistan for as long as – as has been the case – the provision of aid and the division of power are one-sided, with the Pashtoons losing out. This, I believe, is something else that we have to stress.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections need to be properly prepared, so that it is clear who is entitled to vote and so that the elections may gain legitimacy, and the new constitution needs to be used in order for this balance of power to be achieved. The new constitution brings with it both opportunities and problems, for it makes Sharia law possible. While the courts still have judges as conservative as the present ones, nothing that comes out of them will be acceptable to us in terms of our view of what the rule of law means. This, I believe, is why we must, over the coming weeks and months, devote much attention and a great deal of effort to looking after this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Above all, though, I would like to thank him for the particular attention he has paid to respect for women’s rights, for the vigilance he has asked us to show because of the fragility of what has been gained. A great deal of progress has indeed been made, at least in the constitutional text: political power exercised by constitutional representatives, representation of women, equality between men and women written in black and white, respect for linguistic diversity considered as an asset and not as a threat and, finally, respect for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Even if an Islamic state is declared, I believe it would be remarkable for that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This challenge is, however, a shared one, faced by both the international community and the European Union. We must respect our own commitments to ensure this democratic transition and it is essential that we are clearly present in order to support all the processes to put in place the necessary structures for civil and economic reform in Afghanistan. In fact, the climate of insecurity must not destabilise the efforts made, and hence the unquestionable need for a multiannual framework programme which would allow both the structuring of the judicial system and the establishment of specific reconciliation regulations as well as an education system.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems to me to be essential that the whole process of pacification should go hand-in-hand with the process of economic and social reconstruction. Having said that, we are wary of the slow pace of this reconstruction, since it could jeopardise the stability necessary for the development of the country. We have made many commitments, we must fulfil them quickly and, above all, understand that the least delay on our part risks being exploited by others to establish their hold on fragile structures, with the help of funds originating from drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also work on making the progress made in favour of the population visible so that the people do not sink into despair after 25 years of war. If we fail to meet this challenge, we could lose not only our credibility, but also an area of peace on which stability in the region depends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Commissioner and his team for their fine work in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind colleagues that in October 2001 the oppression of Afghan women was highlighted globally. The assumption was made that the removal of the Taliban regime would ease the women's plight. Today, two and a half years on, Amnesty claims that the international community and the Afghan administration have been unable to protect the rights of women. Rape and sexual violence by members of the occupying armed forces are still widespread. In the western province of Herat, Taliban-like decrees are still widespread and, as a result of this oppression, more women in Afghanistan are committing suicide now than they were under the Taliban regime. Human Rights Watch reports many sexual assaults against children.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the rhetoric, the creation of the Women's Ministry, the Karzai Government pursues anti-women policies, and there is no legal protection, while older legal systems still in position prohibit them from getting help. Women's resistance to the regime still has to work underground. The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan is forbidden to open an office and distribute its magazine. People caught reading its literature are still in physical danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten said that Afghanistan had reached a crossroads. I believe, as do Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, that the government has taken a wrong turn and that the position of women is worse than it was before.</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in the proposed motion, all this is passed over in silence. Not a word is said about the criminal responsibility of the Americans and, in essence, support is given to the foreign-born Karzai government, the credentials of which, as we know, are non-existent. The report accepts these interventions and tries to propose solutions without disputing the present situation. It considers the transfer of the responsibility of the occupying forces to NATO to be positive and proposes new funding which will strengthen its position in the controlled areas, while there is no guarantee whatsoever for the management of these funds for the benefit of the Afghan people, especially women. It welcomes the new constitution approved by the Loya Jirga, while at the same time highlighting its negative aspects, which make it unacceptable. It nurtures futile hopes of democratic elections, while recognising that the conditions for them are not in place. At the same time, while finding that today the main source of income is from the cultivation of opium, the primary revenue from which goes to local warlords, it does not concern itself at all with its further movements in the world and the involvement of the CIA in it.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, although we congratulate and thank the rapporteur, André Brie, on the huge effort he has made, we unfortunately cannot support his report, because it is clear from the foregoing that the report does not face the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Afghan people, victims of the new order, will be able to find their way if they resist the forces propelling it, either in the form of religious fanaticism or under the cloak of a poor copy of a western-type bourgeois democracy, the military interventions and the occupation. We must support them in this fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to examine the Commissioner’s communication in greater depth, however. Commissioner, you have overwhelmed us a little with figures, and I admit that they are impressive. However, I am wondering about the following. We have here a country which is in need of reconstruction, which must first and foremost reconstruct itself, and an economic basis is a prerequisite for this. As you emphasise, the fight against opium cultivation is a very important aspect, but, in all the various measures forming part of the strategy to combat that opium cultivation, I have not actually heard what alternatives the producers have. I have seen documentaries showing how the military descend upon farming communities and destroy everything for the sake of opium cultivation. I do understand the necessity of this, but how do we mean for it to stop if people do not have an alternative income? The same goes for the warlords. How are they ever to stop being warlords if they are constantly being supplied with money from the opium economy?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I had actually wanted to speak about women, but I cannot because my time is up. I should like to give one example, however: the construction of a women’s centre in Kabul on which work had only taken a few months. It was built, it was inundated with women looking for education and health care, it was a place where they could take off their burkas in peace. It is possible; why is it, then, that we are so slow to produce results with international resources? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would now like to address Commissioner Patten: there are two issues that I would like him to raise. In November 2003, Mr Karzai's Government allowed the enforcement of a 1970 law banning married women from the classroom which, according to the Deputy Education Minister, led to the expulsion of about two to three thousand women. Could you raise the issue of this law enforcement? Article 3 of the Afghan Constitution states that: 'No law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam.' This language – designed to secure a relatively smooth approval of the new Afghan Constitution – may entail high costs for women in the future. The control of education by religious authorities is definitely a very alarming signal and an issue that should be raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Many reports confirm that in several regions of Afghanistan there is no security for women, and education for girls is under threat. 16 attacks have been documented on girls' schools since September 2002, ranging from rocket attacks to setting schools on fire or their forced closure by gunmen. Their effect is devastating. According to the UN Development Programme, the gross enrolment ratio at primary level has been most recently calculated as being 39% for boys, with a corresponding rate for girls of just 3%.</p>
<p class="contents">The UNICEF programme 'Back to School', launched in March 2002, gave rise to great expectations. More than three million children – one-third of them girls – flooded the classrooms in Afghanistan. However, in Kandahar, leaflets were distributed with the message 'Stop sending your women to offices and daughters to school. It spreads indecency and vulgarity. Stand ready for the consequences if you do not heed the advice.' Then, after five months, these violent attacks on girls' schools began.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the immense challenges that confront the Afghan Transitional Authority today. The European Union and the international community should strongly support economic, social and political reconstruction. However, it is imperative that security for women throughout the country is a priority for both donors and the Afghan Government. If we fail in that, the future will be very grim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot of resources will be needed to rebuild the country, and the EU is a large donor; in my view this entitles us to lay down significant political conditions, including demanding progress in human rights, particularly women's rights to education and access to the workforce. I also regret the new Constitution, which gives primacy to Sharia law over international, UN, civil, and political treaty obligations: this may cause conflict over areas such as female lapidation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned at the lack of security and the necessary concentration of ISA forces in Kabul to protect the government. There have been significant regroupings of Taliban and al-Qa'ida forces bent on murdering international aid workers in the provinces, which will set back progress. I do not believe President Musharraf is doing enough to rein in terrorist groups in Pakistan's tribal areas and north-west frontier provinces; this is ostensibly because Islamabad's writ does not run to these parts. More must be done if he is to have credibility in the fight against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that the Bactrian gold treasures were recovered and I would like to see funds devoted to the reconstitution of the National Museum in Kabul as a symbol of national pride under the patronage of the royal family, which is a benign uniting force in the land.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of the opium crop, my amendment has suggested consideration being given to buying and burning or using it for medical purposes as a painkiller, as a cheaper alternative to drug enforcement measures by the international organisations dedicated to fighting the drug trade and business. It would save the international community a lot of money to burn it and pay the farmers, instead of spending many billions of dollars fighting the drug trafficking trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This important report, in the context of the development of democracy in Afghanistan, is highly topical. As the report emphasises, the situation since the end of the Taliban regime has improved, but additional efforts need to be made. For example, as many have said this morning, the situation of women must be highlighted. Literacy is still unbelievably low, with only a 10% to 15% literacy rate among women. Only one-third of school children are girls. They are often held back from returning to school. And even if some of these women go to school they face violence just for attending. These trends are strongest outside Kabul, in the south and east of the country, where the situation of women is not so well known but is much worse than in the political centre.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution, drawn up in January, specifically recognises the equality between men and women. 25% of the seats in the House of the People are reserved for women, yet it remains uncertain that this provision, along with others establishing rights for women, will help to implement women's rights properly or help women get elected in the coming election.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members have talked about the issue of drugs. We live in a world where a poppy grown in Afghanistan can end up being illegally sold as heroin in Scotland. The human suffering caused by the drugs problem and its links to crime in our communities concerns us all. That is why we should support the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which sets the target of complete elimination of poppy growing by 2013. I am pleased that the UK Government plans to deploy an enhanced drugs team to Kabul and Kandahar by the end of the year and has made GBP 70 million available, over three years, for law enforcement, capacity-building, alternative livelihoods for those who are involved in poppy cultivation, and demand-reduction initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that capacity for effective public administration continues to improve at central and provincial levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their work is, however, being sabotaged by the presence of the American forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, I had the opportunity, together with an EU delegation, to visit the US headquarters in Baghram. It was clear that the Americans have no plans whatsoever regarding women’s rights, democracy or the fight against drugs. By their own admission, what interests them is that each government in Afghanistan should acknowledge the US troops’ right to return, if they ever leave the country. That is quite revealing in terms of what is at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">When we were in Baghram, there was something we did not get to see and about which an American journalist told us, namely the prison in Baghram, in comparison with which reports from Guantánamo Bay seem like accounts of a Sunday school picnic. She had learned that, at that time in any case, there were several hundred prisoners in the jail at Baghram, exposed to torture. They were not being hit, but they were forced to stand naked for hours, day in and day out, under constant questioning. Finally, two prisoners died, and the journalist got an honest American doctor to state clearly in the death certificate that the cause of death was murder. It nonetheless took several months before the New York Times dared to publish the relevant article.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how sensitive it is to acknowledge that in Afghanistan, just as in many other places, the American soldiers are gangsters who use every means available to defend American interests but who are completely indifferent to the local population. Let us remove the Americans and replace them with reasonable people from the ISAF and aid organisations. There are so many others who can make constructive efforts. The Americans are merely making a bad situation worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The essential picture painted by the report is a very pessimistic one, which, in my view, takes too little account of the positive elements, one of which was, without a doubt, the Loya Jirga’s adoption of the constitution last December. The constitution is primarily intended to strengthen central government, without which this country, divided between ethnic groups and torn asunder by decades of warfare and Soviet occupation, has scarcely any chance of building itself into a nation or of normal development.</p>
<p class="contents">The next thing needed is democratic elections, which will, in this country, be a difficult process. Even though the preparatory work has got underway too late, the elections should be held as soon as possible, on the presupposition that they will reinforce the stabilisation process. I am aware that the Americans are insisting on the elections being held in June, but, if the situation is to be kept calm, and the conditions for a more or less democratic election created, it is not absolutely necessary to stick to this date. We said in August that it would be no disaster if they were to be held rather later. All the other measures intended to help pacify the country can be compared with the proverbial glass of water, which is either half full or half empty.</p>
<p class="contents">The security situation is as dire as it was before. The militant Taliban have apparently re-established themselves in the south-east, and the Americans are not excluding the possibility of using land troops in a spring offensive. Although the extension of the ISAF’s operations to the areas outside Kabul is to be welcomed, its mandate is so limited that German troops stationed in Kundus – the safest area, incidentally – are in fact simply onlookers while opium smuggling continues to be one of the country’s main sources of revenue, which, in its turn, has made Afghanistan the world’s largest producer of opium. The opium trade is in full swing, still helping to maintain the warlords and their armies, and that is one of the main problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Doubly unfortunately, the vote was lost by 11 votes to 8.</p>
<p class="contents">On Afghanistan, firstly I congratulate Mr Brie on his report on a difficult subject in a difficult country. I was privileged to be part of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to Afghanistan in June 2003. It was clear that security is the paramount issue. Unfortunately, the glass increasingly seems to be half-empty, rather than half-full.</p>
<p class="contents">The occupying coalition troops and the United States sit out their days in their fixed and mobile fortresses, when on the streets they exhibit the same heavy-handed style currently displayed in Iraq. ISAF has a footprint centred on Kabul, limiting its operations to 2% of Afghanistan's land area. The rest of the country is effectively abandoned to feuding warlords who monopolise revenues and dispense arbitrary justice in their private prisons, making President Karzai at times little more than the United States-backed mayor of Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">After the marines killed three Afghan national army soldiers in a friendly-fire exchange, ISAF stepped in to broker peace between the two groups, ostensibly on the same side. Yet for many in the Afghan national army, the ISAF and the United States troops are merely all flowers from the same garden.</p>
<p class="contents">Campaigns without resources to spread ISAF's presence outside Kabul are wishful and wistful thinking. No-one seems able or willing to find the money to increase the number of troops – some 40 000 would be needed for nationwide coverage.</p>
<p class="contents">In the south the main targets for the remnants of the Taliban are foreigners, but without reconstruction work, the temptation for the local population is to see the situation as no better, if not worse, than under the Taliban. Many people argue that large sections of the Taliban could be brought back into civic society, but to do that would be to shift the social centre of gravity back towards an Islamic conservatism that bodes ill for women's emancipation.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights is important, particularly the situation of women. Formal rights may well be given but they are unlikely to play out in the villages. The best hope for the future may be universal education, which will not change current attitudes but rather those of the next generation.</p>

<p class="contents">I have four points I wish to make to Parliament and to Commissioner Patten. The first concerns drugs. While the international community works to prevent drug abuse, Afghanistan’s illegal opium production discourages individual governments in the surrounding area from contributing financially to the reconstruction of the country. According to an investigation by the UN body for drugs control and crime prevention, Afghanistan was responsible in 2003 for three quarters or 75% of the world’s total production of illegal opium. That is, to say the least, deeply worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the position of women. The antidemocratic and Islamicist Taliban regime was guilty during its time in power of the most deliberate violation of women’s rights in modern times. The regime introduced a gender apartheid that totally denied women’s identity. The Taliban regime is now gone but, in very many respects, its view of women still prevails in Afghanistan. The country’s authorities, the international community and the EU must therefore make every possible effort to change this view.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns freedom of religion. Afghanistan’s first constitution following the fall of the Taliban dictatorship is cause for concern, given certain wordings about the dominant role of Islamic law, about restrictions upon certain human rights and individual freedoms and about restrictions upon women’s rights.</p>

I also had the honour of being on the delegation to Afghanistan. I know that some people have congratulated me on being a first in a number of things. Another first that I now count is the fact that I was sitting having tea with some of the biggest drug dealers and drug producers in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly addressing my remarks to the honourable Member who, I know, is going to disappear into the sunset before too long, but maybe he can make a great contribution to European safety if in his few months remaining he takes on board some of the issues I was talking about. The total value of the poppy crop at the farm gate in Afghanistan is estimated at EUR 700 million. Its heroin street value is estimated at EUR 12.5 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of revenue spent by Member State police forces, customs services and anti-drug squads to control heroin imports and use alone adds up to EUR 4 billion per year. The number of arrests for drug offences throughout the EU is around 700 000 people per year. 60 000 people are imprisoned every year for drug offences, leading to annual custodial costs of EUR 1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an alternative development approach for Afghanistan which integrates EU drug policy into its development policy. We have to offer the rural population economically viable and steady means of earning an income. Therefore is it not far better to stop this trade at the point of growing, rather than the point of consumption or distribution? If we do this, we will save EUR 4 billion in policing costs alone, and EUR 1.5 billion in custodial costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose to the honourable Member that we manage this transition, from poppy growing to fruit growing, as we now do for Greek tobacco, which we buy and burn. A similar exercise could be done for the poppy crop in Afghanistan, and I would like the honourable Member to take this on board seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
