<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 1999 was a year of great progress in fighting fraud. After the old Commission resigned, it was only a few weeks before agreement was reached on the legal texts establishing the new European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF. Parliament, the Council and the Commission had to and were therefore able to demonstrate that the EU was capable of taking action in the fight against fraud, corruption and mismanagement. Full implementation of what was agreed over two years ago has, however, proved to be somewhat more difficult than originally assumed. The first annual report by the OLAF Supervisory Committee accordingly quite rightly sounded the alarm.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the new Director, Mr Brüner, has been in his post for over a year now, he has so far not been able to put together a new management team for OLAF, and this is chiefly because the Commission has involved him in an administrative trench war over the procedures for recruiting the new management. Of course, one of the questions here is the independence of OLAF and its Director. The Commission's position on this is inconsistent. When it comes to appointing new members of the management team, the Commission wants to precisely supervise and be involved in every single step. But when it comes to taking back staff that do not meet the new job specification for OLAF, then the Commission behaves as if this were not its concern at all. And yet it was the Commission that simply transferred the entire staff of the previous UCLAF task force to OLAF <span class="italic">en bloc</span>, thus creating the majority of the problems which the Director of OLAF is now having to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, this transfer took place despite explicit warnings from this House. Parliament then slammed on the emergency brakes and held back the additional posts earmarked for the current year. It is now the responsibility of the Commission to eliminate the obstacles I have described. It only makes sense to remove the present reserve if this condition is met.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, you personally and the Commission as a whole have come to the conclusion that without a European Public Prosecutor the fight against fraud will remain a half measure. The detection and clearing-up of fraud and other offences adversely affecting the Union's interests must be followed by prosecution and punishment. We will really have egg on our face if it turns out in one or two years' time that what I hope will be a very efficiently operating Anti-Fraud Office has exposed significantly more cases of fraud and irregularities than in the past, but that there is a problem with punishing those responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that the Commission's annual report is full of statistics, but it does not contain any information on the number of people actually convicted following cases of fraud. I am sure that if this statistic were available it would tell a sorry tale. However, these people will not be punished unless there is a prosecutor representing the interests of Europe's taxpayers, and that applies above all to the institutions of the European Union itself. And they can only be credible if it is visibly demonstrated that the much-vaunted zero-tolerance policy is more than just empty words and is being put into practice. This requires a public prosecutor, and, as Parliament has already demanded on various occasions, one that is exclusively responsible for the Union's institutions. This was proposed by the five independent experts in their second report on the reform of the Commission in September 1999. Furthermore, the OLAF Supervisory Committee has since then on several occasions, and in the clearest possible terms, called for what might be called for the appointment of an internal public prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">For the avoidance of all doubt, let me say that a public prosecutor of this kind could not, as the law currently stands, himself appear as a prosecutor in the national courts; his role would be to support and advise the relevant national public prosecutor's offices. It would also be his job to supervise OLAF's internal investigations within the institutions, and he would thus work in partnership with the Director of OLAF. The Director of OLAF currently has to make contact with the Secretaries-General of the institutions if OLAF wishes to carry out internal investigations, and it is therefore easy to suggest that his investigations are not truly independent. This problem would to a large extent be solved if there were a public prosecutor for internal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">There would be no automatic extension of such a public prosecutor's powers beyond the Union's institutions. That would require an amendment to the Treaties. Such an amendment failed in Nice because of opposition from several Member States. However, the Commission cannot just sit back and do nothing, now of all times. It must now demonstrate that it really is serious about fighting fraud and is doing everything possible, displaying originality and political courage, on the basis of the current Article 280. One thing must be made clear, however: discussion papers, green papers and white papers are not enough. There are plenty of those already. What is needed now is a concrete proposal for a regulation to be adopted by the Council and Parliament under the codecision procedure. In other words, the Commission must exercise its right of initiative. We need another great leap forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half years after the Prodi Commission took office, we still remember its fine-sounding but pompous announcements about zero-tolerance towards fraud and corruption, together with the promises made by the retread Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, to make this Commission the best administration in the world. Unfortunately, even one and a half years on, there is still an alarming gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the Prodi Commission. In view of its failure to catch up on the backlog of old cases and to prevent new cases of fraud, I feel bound to ask the Commission why it is not seizing this opportunity to make a truly fresh start.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there is no sign of a new wind blowing through the Commission, apart from the hot air emanating from the tonnes of papers on reform generated by Commissioner Kinnock. And those reforms are already in danger of failing because of internal resistance from officials. Real problems in the fight against fraud and corruption, such as the overdue reform of the disciplinary procedure, are not being tackled. The Commission has high-handedly ignored all Parliament's suggestions in this field, and it is giving exactly the same treatment to Parliament's requests for a European Public Prosecutor's Office to be set up and for the independence of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Cover-ups, camouflage and deceit should not form the Commission's strategy for the fight against fraud. The Fléchard case, which dates back to the beginning of the 1990s, is an example of how not to do things. The arbitrary and unlawful decision made by the Delors cabinet in January 1994 ultimately led to a situation in which this company was able to play an important role in a fresh fraud scandal concerning traffic in adulterated butter between 1995 and 2000. It has not been possible to clarify or predict the extent and consequences of this scandal either in financial terms or as regards the significant risk to public health. In my view, the way it handles this case is the most important yardstick for the Commission's attempts to improve matters. I say that because this case in no longer just about the significant financial losses that the Community has suffered through fraud, but it is also about the health risk to the public both in Europe and beyond. So swift and consistent action is needed more than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, as has so often happened, hide behind the need to protect companies' commercial interests. Instead, it should strike a balance between those commercial interests and the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">As in all democratic European States, budgetary control is one of the most important rights and duties of the Members of the European Parliament. So the Commission should not resort to artifice to obstruct that control. Those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear from such control. If on its own authority the Commission withholds documents classified as confidential, or gives them to some Members but not to others, that amounts to a blatant infringement of fundamental constitutional principles such as equal treatment and non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework agreement of 5 July 2000, which was worked out with excessive haste, and which is supposed to legitimise such actions on the part of the Commission, needs to be measured against these democratic principles and is bound to fail that test.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank Mr Bösch for his report and I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation across party lines in this highly important area.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the main subject in the 1999 annual report on OLAF is, of course, the dismantling of the criminal organisation responsible for adulterating butter and fraudulently obtaining public funds, an organisation based in Naples but with influence at the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report, I think that a special compliment is certainly due not just to OLAF but also to the Italian and French judicial organisations whose joint work led to this organised crime network being broken up. According to the latest information available, the scheme for adulterating butter set up by a number of Camorra families in Naples produced 130 000 tonnes of totally or partially artificial butter. I think that makes this the biggest fraud ever committed against the EU's common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question that comes to mind here is how it is possible that a policy that is supposed to help rural communities and farmers can end up systematically financing major agro-industrial complexes, and that those complexes frequently turn out to be no more scrupulous in respecting the Community budget than they are towards consumers and the farmers in whose name they are financed. The second question that needs asking here is how it is possible for a fraud on this scale, which was meticulously planned and put into operation over three years, and involving astronomical Community subsidies, to go undetected, and for the Commission to have been incapable of detecting anything at all. After the persistent revelations of fraud concerning the use of subsidised powdered milk for feeding calves, of bogus butter exports and revelations regarding adulterated dairy products, the Commission still seems unwilling, despite this huge scandal, to carry out a thorough review of its entire system of intervention in dairy products.</p>
<p class="contents">The pan-European nature of this fraud, which involved major dairy product companies in countries such as Belgium, France, Italy and Germany, means that it is unacceptable for the policies needed to combat food adulteration to be permanently left in the hands of the Member States. This also makes it more urgent for the Commission to adopt direct measures to combat the adulteration of products such as olive oil, wine and dairy produce. The Commission has refused to divulge names, to arrange special surveillance or to take preventive measures against the innumerable dairy product companies involved, on the grounds of legal confidentiality and the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am bound to say that the Commission's discretion in this case is very much in contrast with the way it dealt with the widow of an adviser to an ex-Commissioner. It is demanding that she should now pay back 18 months of her late husband's salary. If there are dairy product companies that are incapable of distinguishing tens of thousands of tonnes of concoctions made from animal waste, oil and chemical products from real butter, how can consumers be expected to have any confidence in their ability to guarantee the quality of their own products? What is also at stake here is whether we are all equal in the eyes of the Commission, or whether when it comes to major companies and big interests, some are evidently more equal than others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, we have still tabled a few amendments to his report. We remain adamant about the fact that this Parliament is not a court of law and that it does not need to pass judgment on certain cases. We must first wait and see what those reports bring and then judge whether the Commission has acquitted itself of its task expertly. That is why the jury is still out on the butter fraud, a case which is indeed probably very extensive, on the flax fraud in Spain and possibly in other countries too, on New Zealand butter and on Stockholm. We will wait for all the reports and will study the Commission’s behaviour in those situations, before passing judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse Mr Bösch’s observations with regard to OLAF’s role. The Director will need to avail himself of his rights and will, as far as we are concerned, be backed by Parliament. Independence is a great good. We also endorse the remarks about the European Public Prosecutor, although I must admit that a minority in my group feels differently about this. We believe that it is necessary, with a view to protecting financial interests, that the Commission table proposals along these lines as soon as possible, and we have quoted, in an amendment, 1 June 2001 as the ultimate deadline in this connection. Closer cooperation is obviously needed between the Commission, the Member States and the European and national courts of auditors. It is probably wise – and we have tabled an amendment to this effect as well – if the Commission were first to define what exactly is considered to be fraud and what is an irregularity. That discrepancy will need to be done away with. We can support Mr Bösch’s late amendment on Switzerland. Switzerland is a key country in Europe when it comes to combating fraud, and we do well to bear this in mind. It is unfortunate that the Swiss population feels so lukewarm about Europe, a fact which we will also need to take into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, we do not believe that Parliament should have unlimited access to all documents from OLAF. The nature of OLAF’s work is such that certain aspects must remain confidential and perhaps even secret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to comment on the sore points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, OLAF’s necessary independence. That means indeed that the OLAF Director will be given full autonomy and far-reaching powers to conduct investigations within all European institutions. This also means that the Commission will refrain from intervening in appointments in any shape or form. Can Commissioner Schreyer tell me how the Commission has reacted to Paragraphs 3 to 6?</p>
<p class="contents">Second sore point: the European Public Prosecutor. We know that a change in the Treaty is needed for this. An attempt which was made, partly on the Commission’s initiative, failed in Nice. We will therefore need to continue putting pressure on the Member States. It is true that what we are asking now is not as far-reaching. Pursuant to Article 82, we want the OLAF regulation to be supplemented with a clause which provides for the appointment of a public prosecutor with powers limited to punishable offences committed by the members and staff of the European Union in respect of the budget. What are your thoughts on the matter, Commissioner Schreyer?</p>
<p class="contents">Third sore point: the cooperation between Member States. The tobacco case in New York versus Reynolds and Philip Morris is indeed a good illustration of how the European Commission actually acts <span class="italic">vis-à-vis </span>tobacco giants. I am delighted that quite a few Member States, including my own country, have offered their support. In this way, we can finally extricate mafia practices from the world of the tobacco giants, practices which cost the Union many billions of euros every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth sore point: the disclosure of information. I was one of the people who rejected the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament. I refuse to go into any further detail and I completely concur with Mr Bösch’s requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I regret that this entire House is haunted by a nationalistic and jingoistic ghost which is quick to take offence. We should be able to spell out in this report what went wrong in Spain in the flax case and in Italy, Belgium and Germany in the case surrounding butter which was tampered with. Consequently, my group will not be supporting the amendments which play down these matters or disguise them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is some unfinished business which speaks against granting a discharge. The Commission knows what it is. The Committee on Budgetary Control has expressed in detail what it sees as matters of confusion to the Commission. The most important matter is the Fléchard case, whose political roots extend back to the early 1990s. Any examination of the case must stretch all the way from the Delors cabinet up until Mr Prodi’s Commission. There are fake export documents, there is fake butter, minutes of meetings have been lost, payments were ordered but the debts were waived, and cooperation was continued with those who were guilty of fraud. There are still some matters that are being hushed up. This will not do. Mr Bösch is right. This is the moment of truth for Mr Prodi’s Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions in European money have been paid out erroneously or, as in the case of cigarette smuggling, have not been collected in revenue. This is not a matter of fraud within the EU institutions but at Member State level. Rapporteur Bösch is right in pointing out that the solving of these serious fraud cases forms OLAF’s test case for efficiency. I must add that these fraud cases cannot be solved completely without the cooperation of the relevant Member States. In order to enforce this cooperation, the Commission must put sanctions in place. I therefore find it completely justified that the Netherlands is not receiving any money from the European Social Fund for the time being, until such time as it can account for the unauthorised spending of those monies down to the last euro. In fact, what sanctions are prompting Spain to clear up the flax fraud?</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses involved in fraud should be blacklisted so that they do not qualify for European subsidy again. They seem logical measures to take, but not to the Commission. That is how the company Fléchard is starting to form part of a European soap: to be continued!</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF’s efficiency is being threatened by a lack of staff. If the fight against fraud is one of President Prodi’s key goals, he, along with the Commission, has a duty to solve the delay in the recruitment of qualified staff promptly. In this connection, the Commission should avoid any conflict of interest. Commissioners who might be involved in the flax and butter fraud, should not have a say in the appointments of officials who are about to investigate their roles.</p>
<p class="contents">As elected representatives of the people, this Parliament has a supervisory task. It is unfortunate that the Commission is forever putting spanners in the works. To the Commission, transparency is an opaque word. Clarity is what this Parliament wants and it should therefore be authorised to examine the OLAF reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial losses associated with adulterated butter alone could exceed EUR 45 million. What is more, it is evident that we are dealing with people who are repeating the same offence. On the Commission's recommendation, one firm, which is now again under suspicion, was let off a EUR 17.6 million fine. We must therefore, as a matter of urgency, give our full backing to the work of the European Anti-Fraud Office and ensure that it is properly set up as soon as possible. However, it is also important for the authorities in the Member States to support the work of this new body, but if you look at the reports in detail, you cannot always be sure this is happening. So sanctions should also be taken against those Member States which are not supporting OLAF's work, in the form of fines imposed by the Commission, which would also provide some financial compensation for fraud offences allowed to occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As other speakers have said, we would like the transition to proceed more quickly. We need an independent OLAF able to operate efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">I must congratulate Herbert Bösch on his excellent report. He has certainly made the point, in the text presented to us, that the fight against fraud is not an element in partisan infighting or in the internal politics of Member States. Instead, he made it clear that we are all equally involved in uncovering fraud at its source and calling its instigators to account. All the parliamentary groups are united in wishing to recover the money and improve administrative checks. We do feel we are making progress in the fight against fraud. That is our message to the citizens and we must ensure it reaches them. True, the Nice Summit did not produce any response to our request for a European Public Prosecutor. Such a prosecutor would have been most helpful to us in uncovering this year’s major fraud, which involved the adulteration of butter. Incidentally, that not only concerns defrauding Community coffers. It is also an indication of how much more we still have to do regarding food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what we have before us today is a good report. I should like to reiterate that we are all determined to combat fraud and recover the money. I feel we should call on the Commission to let us know what it has in mind in the specific case of the European Prosecutor. Perhaps the opportunity missed at Nice could be retrieved through some specific proposals. The cooperation of national prosecutors is not enough. Just as it has been shown in some cases that the national authorities know how to coordinate their work, so it is necessary to have someone within the Commission able to take the lead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, also like to stress the pitfalls that might have been encountered along the way, as Mr Bösch has had to deal with the vague desires harboured by various members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who wanted to refocus the report on previous cases and Treaties, which are also dealt with in other documents.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this, I do not share the view of the speakers who say that the Fléchard case is the main case in the discharge. It probably is if you consider the time and energy that the Commission and ourselves had to spend on it, but it is definitely not in terms of importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, however, focus my attention on the problem of fraud and irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">In a previous report, the Committee on Budgetary Control stated that the slightest fraud of the Community budget must no longer be tolerated. Whilst this call for zero tolerance is extremely laudable, we cannot disregard the fact that putting this into practice requires very significant resources in terms of personnel which is going to be difficult to achieve, given the huge numbers of schemes currently underway, and given the great diversity of the territories in which we have a presence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, it was proposed to remove the distinction between fraud and irregularities, which would be justified by the fact that, when these are detected, we do not know whether the cases in question are likely to lead to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my concern about this position, for which I have two reasons. On the one hand, we must ensure that our fight against fraud does not anticipate the conclusions of inquiries that various bodies are undertaking. On the other hand, we would be running the risk of discrediting the European Union’s policies within the European Union itself if we announce levels of fraud in criminal cases that are much higher than reality shows them to be. Quite the contrary, I think that we must make a concerted effort to present the fairest possible picture of these criminal acts, since it is impossible to treat problems related to small administrative mistakes and large scale organised fraud in the same way. I support what Mr Mulder has just said regarding a classification of irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, we must focus our work on cases of fraud that require us to become immediately involved in following them up because of their scale and topical interest. In relation to this, several speakers have mentioned the case of the adulterated butter. The Commission must be in a position to help us to achieve our aim. I would say, however, that I regret the attitude of the Commission, which sometimes takes too long to answer or provides unsatisfactory answers to the European Parliament’s requests. The European Commission and the European Parliament should work together more closely in combating fraud. This does not mean, however, that the European Parliament has to give up its power to penalise the Commission when it does not fulfil its duties, particularly with regard to protecting the European Union’s financial interests. This cooperation is needed because it involves our credibility in the eyes of the citizens of Europe who have put their trust in us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it shows how large a part the Member States play in administering the EU budget, as they use up 80% of all expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch has drafted a creditable report and I would like to thank him for it. The report also shows clearly how important it was to establish OLAF in 1999. In my opinion, it would be important in the fight against fraud to bear in mind certain principles. Firstly, let us speak of the principle of legality. It is vital to comply with the law when using funds and investigating irregularities, and the final outcome should not be anticipated before a legal decision comes into effect. Administration has to be simplified; there is an end to how much increased bureaucracy and supervision will improve the way funds are spent. Personal responsibility has to be increased – in this respect, the Commission’s reform has been vital – and cooperation between the European Union and the Member States must be improved: that, too, will be vital in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the EU, the institutions are located in different places and they are also subject to relocation. That is why it makes sense to locate new institutions in places where they are geographically close to other EU institutions which they will have to cooperate very intensively with in the future. Now, it seems to me that the European Public Prosecutor's Office will certainly have to cooperate with the European Court of Justice and that it should also have close contacts with the European Court of Auditors. The same also applies to OLAF, which will have to work in very close cooperation with both the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors. I therefore believe that these bodies should be located either completely or at least in part in Luxembourg, so as to ensure geographical proximity and also efficiency for these bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And his conclusion that there have not yet been any appreciable improvements in the fight against fraud also coincides with the OLAF Supervisory Committee's view. Furthermore, the Commission itself says several times in its own report that there were no significant changes in 1999 as compared with previous years, and that the total of unlawfully used funds in fact increased in some areas, for example in the Structural Funds. Let me emphasise once again that we are talking about taxpayers' money here. We must do our best to protect it.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to reach the zero-tolerance limit promised by the Commission, OLAF, the European Fraud Investigation Office established in 1999, must first and foremost be given greater independence. This involves recruiting its staff without interference from the Commission, for example. I support Mr Bösch's suggestion that the appointments committee should be chaired by an independent figure. And the Director himself must set out in advance a clearly structured programme of work. One thing that is clear is that we do not just want the old UCLAF to continue under the new name of OLAF. Unfortunately, an opportunity was missed in Nice to strengthen OLAF by creating a European Financial Public Prosecutor's Office and putting it under judicial control.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all Parliament's requests over the years and the commitment demonstrated by Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Schreyer in particular, this subject was not even on the agenda at Nice. I therefore have some questions for the Commission now, as to whether, in accordance with Paragraphs 9 to 12 of the Bösch report, it will submit proposals by 1 June 2001 for what we might call a European Public Prosecutor's Office with restricted jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like put this question to the Commission: not all the Member States have yet ratified the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and this is preventing it from entering into force. Could you please tell us which countries have not yet ratified it and what the Commission can do to remedy this intolerable situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: what is the Commission doing to overcome varying national interpretations of Community law on the recovery of own resources, as described in Paragraph 7(1) of its report? And lastly, there is the recovery of unduly paid funds, for which there are no figures in the Commission's report for 1999. Can the Commission tell me how much the Commission has claimed back and received as compared with the losses calculated, especially in the case of own resources in the EAGGF and in the Structural Funds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, by the 1998-99 season it was already being cultivated on 100 000 hectares. The initial subsidy in 1994-95 amounted to ESP 411 million, whereas by 1998-99 it had risen to ESP 10 000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Spanish authorities reported the fraud, the area used for the cultivation of flax decreased as if by magic. Those 100 000 hectares were reduced to less than 1000. As a result, the subsidy fell to below ESP 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all this data, the head of the Ministry of Agriculture at the time maintained it was all part of an opposition campaign. True, she recently changed her mind and stated that had not been the case, but that essentially the opposition was to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on the type of liability the House might invoke. In the first place, there is penal liability as it applies to individual owners of processing plants. They were privy to special information – I am not referring to information about the regulations, which was in the public domain, but information on how they could be got round. These persons had at their disposal the capital required to set up the companies. Most importantly, they were sitting pretty, holding high office in the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore appropriate to invoke strictly penal liability for them and for the producers who also played the game. Parliament and the relevant institutions should do precisely that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another type of liability: specific political liability. This means establishing whether any of the players directly involved in the fraud had been appointed to public political office by an institution in Spain. It has to be said that such was indeed the case. One of the highest-ranking officials within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chair of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, was closely connected with flax processing companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is also administrative liability. If this does apply, we should call the Commission and national and local authorities to account. We should not, however, create confusion and adopt the course advocated by Mr Bösch, insisting that liabilities be itemised in detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he knows how highly I rate his work. I would therefore like to comment on a few points that have been mentioned in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that we welcome the fact that the OLAF report on the Fléchard case was submitted last week, something that has not yet been mentioned. This is a positive point that should be take into account in further discussions. This report does not establish or seek to establish what the European Parliament's view on this case is. That is part of the budget discharge process, which will be on our agenda in a month's time.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to give the Commission some sound advice. It would certainly be very helpful for the discussions on the budget discharge if the Commission could reconsider the views it has already expressed on this case, and take advantage, for example, of the opportunity presented to it next week by the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control. That could certainly assist the subsequent deliberations in the context of the budget discharge process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also two other points in some way connected with misunderstandings. Mr Mulder mentioned one misunderstanding, and I think Mr Seppänen's speech was a case in point: there is some confusion between irregularities and fraud. We must make it clear in this report, on the basis of the amendment tabled by Mr Bösch himself and supplemented by Mr Mulder's amendment, that we do not want to see these categories being muddled up. I would like to clarify this in the light of one particular example: Mr Seppänen's speech. In it, he literally referred to the Fléchard case as an irregularity, and then connected it with the Court of Auditors' failure to give a positive statement of assurance concerning the Commission's budget management. If we do this we are mixing things up and run the risk of giving our visitors in the public gallery the impression that even a bookkeeping error would be classified as fraud. No one can have any political interest in doing that. We must make sure that these two things are not confused.</p>
<p class="contents">The second possible misunderstanding is not a misunderstanding amongst ourselves, but rather a misunderstanding outside this Chamber, regarding the flax affair. As I understand it, the decision-making process in one Member State was described by the Committee on Budgetary Control as if responsibility had been shifted from national to regional level. On behalf of my group I would like to say that regardless of the internal organisation of the individual Member States, we want to ensure that responsibility towards the European Union at national level for the correct implementation of EU programmes is respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank Mr Bösch for his report. It takes as its starting point the Commission's Annual Report on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud, which the Commission presented on 13 November 2000 and which also contains statistics on cases of irregularities and fraud reported by the Member States, as they are obliged to do.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months earlier, the Commission had presented an extensive strategy report in which it set out an approach to fraud prevention at a wide variety of levels and which contained a wide variety of instruments ranging from checks on legislation, in order to make it less susceptible to fraud, to a proposal for a European Public Prosecutor which the Commission put forward in Nice and which was unfortunately not accepted by the Heads of State and Government at that stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In that report, the Commission also set out the overall and central role played by the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, and I would first like to address the points made by honourable Members during the debate and also in Mr Bösch's report as regards OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 the Council and Parliament created the legal basis for OLAF, and that is, of course, also the basis for action by the Commission on this. In accordance with this legal basis, OLAF was set up as an office which administratively speaking is part of the Commission, that is to say OLAF's staff are Commission officials and are subject to its statute. This also means that if, for example, problems or irregularities arise regarding the behaviour of Commission officials within OLAF, the Commission would be held responsible. In view of this, the Commission has said that, exactly as with the other institutions or other departments of the Commission, it wishes a transparent procedure to be in place for appointing those in senior management positions in OLAF. This means that an Advisory Committee first scrutinises the applications and then makes recommendations to those making the final decision. In the case of OLAF, the Director makes the final decision on the recruitment and appointment of staff. The Advisory Committee is constituted so that members not directly linked to the Commission and those from OLAF itself are in a clear majority. The Court of Auditors, the European Court of Justice and the Supervisory Committee are represented on the Advisory Committee, and I believe that the solution we have now found is a very good one. I would like to remind you once again that this solution is in the interest of transparency in the appointment of senior management, but that the Director or Director-General of OLAF has the final say on appointments.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that a solution will very soon be found as regards further recruitment at OLAF, as I can only repeat that it is certainly not only in my own interest but also in the interest of the Commission as a whole for OLAF to fill all the posts that have actually been agreed as quickly as possible. I think it would also be in the interest of the various parties concerned if they could enter into a dialogue, as the Supervisory Committee has now set further conditions so that the rectifying budget can finally be brought in and this issue resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly cover one point that you touched on in the report and which has also been raised here several times, namely access to OLAF's reports. The legal basis for the establishment of OLAF clearly provides that it is the Director or Director-General of OLAF who makes decisions about reports and not the Commission. Furthermore, the legal basis also stipulates that OLAF must, of course, take account of data protection, professional secrecy and also the investigation procedures, and this is clearly a key point. The Commission accordingly has some doubts as to whether the demands made in the report can be reconciled with the legal basis. Of course, it is also a matter for debate within the European Parliament whether, for example, if OLAF carries out an investigation within Parliament, this report should be transmitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control, to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, or to the President. As I see it, this touches on questions affecting all the institutions and I think that this should really be debated and discussed in an appropriate interinstitutional forum such as the trialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards OLAF's fitness for purpose, or rather the work done and successes chalked up so far, I would say that uncovering the fraud that we now refer to as the butter case, that is the butter adulteration affair, is one of OLAF's success stories. This discovery was partly possible because OLAF was able to make its information available to the Member States carrying out investigations, and accordingly, at least as OLAF understands it, this helped to ensure that those involved were investigated in a relatively short time.</p>
<p class="contents">But the issue of when OLAF can report depends on when OLAF receives authorisation from the Member States, who have the prime responsibility for investigation, to make a report. I say this because all OLAF's work is dependent on close and successful cooperation with the Member States. This is crucial for strengthening OLAF overall, and in particular as regards making it a platform for information exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Fléchard case dating back to 1991 or 1994, the Commission will also explain its position to the Committee on Budgetary Control and it will, of course, respond in reasonable time to the questionnaire that has been drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the butter case, I would like to say once again that it is the subject of legal investigations being carried out by the various Member States affected. On the Stockholm affair, which you also mention in your report, I can tell you that this is also before the courts. I very much hope, and, of course, this is in the Commission's interest as well, that the Swedish courts will very soon come to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the issue of a European Public Prosecutor with limited jurisdiction, as opposed to the full concept, our investigations indicate – and this is also OLAF's legal view – that there is no legal basis for this, and that a treaty amendment would be needed to achieve this also.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned the subject of what I might call legal supervision of the work of OLAF itself. This question is certainly still open. The Director-General of OLAF has undertaken to make a manual available very shortly so as to make it transparent what rules OLAF follows when it makes a decision about carrying out or closing an investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that since the last debate here the Commission has brought an action against two tobacco companies regarding alleged involvement in international smuggling, an issue that has been mentioned here. I am, of course, pleased that you support this in your report, Mr Bösch. The Commission has also introduced a more effective early warning system within its bookkeeping procedures, so as to alert the various administrative offices as quickly as possible if, for instance, there are plans to enter into a contract with a party already known for irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Theato's question about the signing of the Convention on the protection of the financial interests of the European Community, some Member States have still to sign it. I can name three Member States that have not yet ratified the Convention, namely Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, for example. However, not all the other Member States have ratified it either. For that reason, and we have already had occasion to discuss this in this Chamber – the Commission will now be being bringing forward a proposal for a directive designed to transfer the provisions of this Convention into a directive, so as to put greater pressure on the Member States to incorporate in their national law a uniform definition of the offence of fraud against the interests of the European Communities. I hope that will happen in April. The Commission is working with OLAF on a Green Paper concerning the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, because we do not intend to give that idea up and will now be seizing the opportunity for a more open and wide-ranging debate. Our objective is quite clear, and that is that when the Treaties are revised again in 2004, we hope to have such broad-based support that the Heads of State and Government will no longer be able simply to ignore this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
