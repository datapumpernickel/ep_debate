<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, we must bear in mind that the powers of investigation and control available to the supervisory authorities in the financial field are incomparably greater than those which exist in other fields. In the financial field – to a large extent because there is public concern about credit and savings, including, therefore, companies which use the securities market – there is a public interest in safeguarding the interests of huge numbers of third-party savers who put their confidence in companies which manage other people’s money while the real owners of that money have no capacity to intervene in that management.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of the interests of third parties justifies a high degree of intervention by the public authorities, which leads, amongst other things, to very great powers which provide the authorities with information about the internal affairs of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt whatsoever that, if the data obtained as a result of the exercise of these authorities were to be made known to third parties, this could not only cause irreparable damage to the bodies under investigation, but could also cause serious fluctuations, and ultimately changes, in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as a counterbalance to such broad powers of investigation, the authorities are obliged to keep the information secret. That duty of secrecy, taken to the extreme, could hinder certain objectives pursued by the control authorities, which, ultimately, consist of ensuring that the markets behave properly.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that one of the areas in which the phenomenon of globalisation has had the most obvious effect is the financial field, in which the large companies use the securities market. Today large companies operate in many countries, but there are no supranational supervisory authorities and furthermore the Community authorities find it difficult to carry out their work outside their own borders. Ultimately, we are talking about issues which involve sovereignty. To sum up, the problem is that the authority supervising the activities of a certain country cannot itself access the data relating to the activity of that company, its parent company or its subsidiaries in other countries because its powers of supervision do not extend beyond the borders of the country to which it belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to resolve this problem cooperation is needed between the authorities of the various countries. This cooperation, amongst other things, has to take the form of an exchange of the data obtained. The problem is that this exchange generally involves a degree of non-compliance with the obligation to secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary for the regulations to provide for a way to overcome this conflict between the obligation to secrecy and the exchange of information, and to seek balanced solutions to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European regulations, after the previous unstable regulation which furthermore was different for the different sectors, in 1998 the first banking sector directive was amended to allow Member States to reach agreements on the exchange of information with third countries, on the condition that the information exchanged was subject to guarantees of professional secrecy at least equivalent to those in force in the European Union. Now, by means of this directive, the corresponding amendments are being made to the other financial sector directives, in the same way that they were made in the case of the banking sector directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we agreed with the 1998 amendment, and for the same reasons, we are going to support these amendments in the terms proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment. We are currently awaiting a report by the European Parliament on the review of the SLIM initiative aimed at simplifying the legislation on the internal market. What has happened in this field may be very significant and it may have very beneficial consequences. If we want to simplify the legislation, it will also be necessary to reduce the number of regulations and rationalise the initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We should consequently ask the question why, when the banking sector directive was amended in 1998, the directives on insurance and collective investment, that is to say the ones that are now being amended, were not amended at the same time. The simplification and coherence of the legislation may perhaps have required this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I recognise that his report is quite brief, but that belies the amount of work that has had to be undertaken because the issue that we are considering is a complex one as he made clear in the course of his remarks. We are dealing in essence with the compromise between access to confidential information, information which comes into the hands of a whole range of regulatory authorities, and the use that is subsequently made of that information. We know that the information is in general gathered as a result of the obligations that rest with companies from the whole of the inspection regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a range of regulators now, across the whole of the European Union, but we very often have a whole range of regulators within Member States themselves, and the dilemma of how information is in fact used is one that is not just a dilemma for the Community and its exchange of information with regulators beyond the Community itself. We often have that dilemma within Member States. I certainly have had first-hand experience of government in the United Kingdom where I can remember very many instances where the government has been on the point of granting a contract to a particular company only to find out that another branch of government is actually engaged in starting legal proceedings for one reason or another against that very company. This is often described as the left arm of government not knowing what the right arm is doing, but what it is really about is the willingness on the part of the regulatory authorities within Member States, but also within the European Union and beyond, to exchange information whilst at the same time respecting confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the second brief point that I wish to make this evening which is about the need for the consolidation of regulatory authorities themselves. That is a process that has been undertaken within the United Kingdom. Recently, Howard Davies, who heads the new Financial Services Authority in the UK, was speaking to our Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and outlining what that experience has been. It has not been a wholly easy experience, but I think that people are broadly of the view that the consolidation of regulatory authorities within the United Kingdom has been a success. It is something that could be commended to other authorities within the European Union, not least because it would lead to a common approach to the use of the information that is made available by this process, to the advantage of investors throughout the whole of the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has facilitated prompt adoption of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposal is to amend several financial services directives, to align them with rules already in force in the banking area in order to improve the exchange of information with third countries. The proposal is also a response to international recommendations on the exchange of confidential information. It is necessary to improve supervision of financial conglomerates. This is an aspect which was stressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster this evening and also Mr Evans. I fully agree with both of them that confidentiality of that information is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The measure proposed will allow European securities and insurance regulators to exchange, on a cross-sectoral basis, confidential supervisory information with third country competent authorities. It also allows European securities and insurance regulators to exchange supervisory information with third country bodies, such as clearing and settlement systems, auditors, etc. which by virtue of their functions help to strengthen the stability of the financial system. The proposal makes clear that information is exchanged for supervisory purposes and it provides for protection of the confidentiality – the important point mentioned – of the information exchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Evans has spoken of the consolidation of regulatory authorities. That indeed is what happens in the United Kingdom. The Financial Services Authority, headed by Mr Howard Davies, is indeed a consolidation of regulatory authorities. That example is followed by Sweden, or perhaps it is the other way around. In other words, both in London and in Stockholm there is a consolidated regulatory apparatus.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the FSA in London there is a unit working with banking. There is another unit working with insurance undertakings and there is a third unit working with the stock exchange. They are under one roof, but under that one roof there are still distinct entities. Mr Evans implies that they are cooperating – and indeed they are cooperating – but cooperation means more than being under one roof. Mr Evans would like the Commission to exhort other Member States to follow the British example or the Swedish example. Opinions differ very much indeed. We are dealing here with a very sensitive question. In some countries there is consolidated regulation but in other countries there are three separate entities, for example in the Netherlands and other Member States. They say: we cooperate, so what is the worry?</p>
<p class="contents">I am not saying that there is no reason to be worried. A report was recently produced by a committee under the chairmanship of Mr Brouwer, who is the second in command of the Bank of the Netherlands. It was welcomed by ECOFIN. It is available on the Internet so anybody can take cognisance of it. The report says that basically, as far as banks and insurance companies are concerned, the institutional framework is adequate but it leaves aside the matter of how to deal with systemic crises. Nor does it deal with stock exchanges. But thinking does not stop. If it did we would be in a very bad position. Everybody knows what has happened in other parts of the world in the way of systemic crises. Also, everybody knows that the alliances between various stock exchanges are the order of the day. So we must give this further attention and see whether the rise of conglomerates leads to the need for further supervision. Certainly in the case of stock markets, whether we should leave everything to national supervisory instances or whether there should be something at European level is a valid question.</p>
<p class="contents">This thinking has not led to any firm conclusions but it is continuing. If developments are favourable then I look forward to engaging in a dialogue with this Parliament on these very matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
