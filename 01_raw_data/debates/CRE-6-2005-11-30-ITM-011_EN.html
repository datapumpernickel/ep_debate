<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pearson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, it is perhaps a coincidence that I am not only UK Trade Minister but also the UK foreign minister with responsibility for human rights. It is a great pleasure to be present here at the European Parliament, and to speak to you as the representative of the UK Presidency and on behalf of the Council, on this important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the European Parliament's interest in this topic – as shown by the public hearing here on 12 September – and by the various resolutions you have passed on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I know from my own position as a UK Minister that there is a great deal of Parliamentary and public concern about human rights in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. This year, for example, I and my colleagues have so far received over 100 letters from UK Members of Parliament about the human rights situation in Vietnam alone and it is an issue that is debated on a regular basis within the UK Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a duty to respond to this concern. Human rights must be an important feature of the European Union's relations with those countries. This is right, not just because it is a matter of concern to people in the European Union; it is also right in itself, because we have a duty to help improve, where we can, the conditions under which the people live in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must engage with these countries in an honest dialogue about human rights, being frank where performance falls below international standards, but also recognising improvements where they occur. If we are to have such an honest dialogue with these countries, we must base it on an accurate picture of what is happening. We harm our own case if we do not base it on accurate information.</p>
<p class="contents">All this also means that we must do all we can to work with these countries for tangible improvements in human rights. It means giving practical support to ordinary people, alleviating where we can the impact of poverty, corruption and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise some honourable Members believe strongly that the human rights situation in these countries is so bad that the Council must take punitive action – through blanket EU sanctions or through a cut or even a complete abandonment of EU aid. Let me say right away that, while we recognise the strength of feeling on this matter, there is no support in the Council for such drastic action, because we believe this would risk harming the very people we are trying to help – the poorest and most vulnerable people. We believe that a critical dialogue with the governments of these countries is the best approach – and that this engagement can and does bring some results.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take Cambodia first. The tragic history of Cambodia requires special measures to ensure the protection of human rights, and to ensure that we never again see the terrible scale of murder and devastation inflicted on the people of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge era. I am pleased to note here that a number of EU Member States, and the European Commission, have contributed financial and practical support for the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. We look forward to the early start of the Tribunal's proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council shares honourable Members' concerns over the current political and human rights situation in Cambodia, and is following the situation closely. We have particular concerns over the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, human trafficking, violence against civil and political activists, impunity and corruption. We want to see real democratic development in Cambodia. This means that government, political parties and civil society must work together to build an environment conducive to legitimate political activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, that is not happening in Cambodia today. The Council is concerned over recent developments affecting the democratic opposition. I appreciate that you also share that concern, judging from your resolution on Cambodia in March and the briefing Sam Rainsy, the Cambodian opposition leader, delivered to the public hearing here on 12 September. Mr Rainsy has visited a number of EU countries, including my own. The Council has expressed its concern over this issue several times recently; for example, on 15 February, over the suspension of the Parliamentary immunity of three members of the opposition; and again on 19 August over the jail sentences imposed on members of the Sam Rainsy Party. We are particularly concerned over the situation of Cheam Channy, who is in prison; the EU Troika raised its concerns over his case directly with the Government of Cambodia most recently on 11 November, during a demarche over freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the political leadership of Cambodia to allow all political parties to operate free of hindrance or intimidation and to allow NGOs and all civil society to play a full part in Cambodia's democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In Laos, the Council has a number of concerns over the human rights situation. We again share honourable Members' concern in particular over freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and the situation of the Hmong people. We are aware that a number of Hmong people have emerged from remote areas in recent months to re-join Lao society and we are encouraged by reports that these people are being treated humanely. We call on the Government of Laos to continue to do so, to ensure they are secure and free from intimidation, and to continue to provide them with the necessary humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's contacts with the Lao authorities are limited. However, I can assure honourable Members that every opportunity is taken to raise our concerns over human rights and governance issues; for example, the EU Heads of Mission did so with the Foreign Minister of Laos on 10 November. We are encouraged by some recent positive signs, for example in the field of freedom of religion and in the creation of a Human Rights Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Laos.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's relations with Vietnam are more substantial; and here too we work hard to ensure proper priority is given in our relationship to the issue of human rights. We hold a regular Human Rights Dialogue with the Vietnamese Government, covering all key areas of concern, for example, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the use of the death penalty, and the situation in the Central Highlands.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting will be held on 12 December, but we use other opportunities to raise human rights concerns as well. For example, the EU Troika Heads of Mission did so during their visit to the Central Highlands last week. Such visits are very important: they enable Heads of Mission to see the situation of the ethnic minorities there at first hand, including those who have chosen to return to the Central Highlands from Cambodia. That is why the Council will continue to press for free access for diplomats and international organisations. We welcome Vietnam's increasing cooperation with the UNHCR, including in the context of the tripartite agreement with Cambodia; and we welcome too signs that those Montagnard refugees returning from Cambodia have been well treated. We will continue to monitor this issue very closely; and to work hard through development aid activities to improve living conditions for ethnic minorities in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We use our contacts with the Vietnamese authorities also to raise issues of individual concern. The EU maintains a list of prisoners and detainees of concern, and takes every opportunity to raise the issue of detention and treatment of people on the list. I am pleased to report some tangible progress here. The Council welcomes the release, so far in 2005, of 12 persons on the list. These are positive steps and we hope the trend continues. We also welcome Vietnam's agreement for the EU to visit two individuals on the list – Thich Quang Do and Than Van Truong – so that we can assess their situation. However, 22 people remain on the list and we will continue to call for their early release.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council regrets, though, that none of those on the EU's list imprisoned in violation of their right to freedom of expression have been released so far. While there are some encouraging signs, the fact remains that in practice freedom of expression is not respected in Vietnam. This is a fundamental human right and a vital element of good governance; so the Council will continue to call on Vietnam to ensure protection of freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise too that many of Vietnam's people are suffering for their religious beliefs. There is particular harassment of members of unrecognised religious groups and house churches. Freedom of religion should not be subject to licensing or state permission: it should be a matter for individual conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too there have been some recent grounds for cautious optimism. We welcome the 2004 Ordinance on Belief and Religion and this year's Prime Minister's Instructions on Protestantism as modest steps forward. We want to see now a speeding-up of implementation of this legislation, an easing of restrictions on unrecognised religious groups allowing them to register themselves. Vietnam must end official harassment of non-recognised religious groups.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Council shares honourable Members' concern over the human rights situation in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Human rights remains an important part of the EU's relationship with these countries. We will continue to raise these issues directly with the governments concerned, and will continue to press them to meet their international human rights standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I would like to start by assuring you that the Commission in all its activities in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam is committed to the principles of human rights, democracy and good governance. The Commission has stated on several occasions that it agrees with Parliament that there are issues of concern in the area of human rights in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">First as regards Laos, freedom of speech, assembly and association remain restricted and independent local civil-society-based organisations are not allowed. The conditions in prisons are particularly harsh and a smaller number of prisoners of conscience are still in prison, for example, the remaining four leaders of the 26 October 1999 movement. On the other hand, in the last two years and in particular during 2005, the situation has improved. Arbitrary arrests of Laos citizens seem to be less frequent and since mid-2004 no cases of religious persecution have been reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the situation of the monks in Laos, the Commission would like to reiterate that in Laos there is not a minority problem of the monks per se. There are approximately 350 000 monks in Laos and they are represented at all levels of society including in the National Assembly and the government. However, there are a number of insurgent groups consisting of between 1000 and 3000 people and composed mainly of monks which continue to oppose the Laos Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding these groups, the situation has improved significantly during the last month following direct negotiations between the Laos army and insurgent groups. Since March 2004 more than 1300 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, have come out from the jungle and been reintegrated and resettled. According to reliable local intelligence there were no killings, mistreatments or persecutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Vietnam, restrictions on the six recognised religious organisations and the lack of religious freedom for non-recognised groups continue to be a major concern. The situation is particularly difficult for ethnic minority Protestants in the central highlands and northern uplands and for non-recognised Buddhists, Hoa Hao and Cao Dai organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">New legislation relating to religious freedom which has been adopted in the last two years has softened some of the tools used by the state to control religious organisations and allows hitherto non-recognised groups to seek official recognition. It also explicitly prohibits forced renunciation of faith. Having said this, much will depend on how the new legislation is translated in practice across the country.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Cambodia, the trends as regards human rights and democracy are more worrying. Recent events like the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of three members of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and the sentencing of two Sam Rainsy Party members undoubtedly raise scepticism about the commitment of the two parties in power in the coalition government to a genuinely pluralistic democratic system. It also highlights concerns about the competence and independence of the Cambodian judiciary. They constitute a further weakening of the opposition and risk stalling the continued development of the democratic process in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members might be aware, a strong EU declaration has been issued on this subject and I can assure you that EU concerns have been brought to the personal attention of the Prime Minister by the local representative of the European Union Presidency. These trends are very serious and deserve our full attention. The Commission, together with representatives of the European Union Member States, will therefore continue to monitor the situation very closely and remain ready to take further action should the situation deteriorate further.</p>
<p class="contents">On a general level, the Commission raises human rights concerns regularly and consistently with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. This is done through ad hoc EU troika demarches and in political and expert level meetings, including the joint committees which are established under the European Community Agreements with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In Vietnam and Laos, specific working groups on cooperation in the areas of institutional strengthening, administrative reform, governance and human rights have been established under the cooperation agreements. These working groups complement and reinforce the dialogue on human rights by sharing experiences and conducting longer-term policy dialogue in areas of mutual interest, as well as identifying suitable areas for cooperation projects and cooperation programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the view that the ongoing dialogue and cooperation at a number of levels and in various fora have proven to be conducive in building confidence and engaging the three countries on sensitive human rights issues. It allows the Commission to channel EU concerns directly to the authorities in an open and constructive atmosphere, putting steady pressure on them to be more transparent and more accountable in human rights policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that engagement on human rights issues through dialogue and cooperation will continue to lead to improvements of the human rights situation on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past several years, they have begun to integrate themselves into the global economic community. However, in Vietnam, for instance, citizens are still being persecuted for their religious beliefs and practices. Whilst in theory the Vietnamese Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief, the country’s courts rarely interpret the laws to protect a person’s right to religious freedom. At the same time as the Communist government cries ‘poor’ and seeks EU aid, its embassy in Canberra, for instance, allegedly spent almost one million Australian dollars celebrating 60 years of communist tyranny.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently the US State Department decided to keep the country on the ‘country of particular concern’ list, as Vietnam started a campaign against religious communities this summer. Police and the military have destroyed ten houses of Catholics in Quang Ngai Province. Moreover, local officials also oppressed in particular the Montagnard, or hill tribe people. People in the Central Highlands are suffering badly as well as the Catholic Hmong people and the Mennonite followers in the country. Vietnam still restricts the press and tightly oversees internet users.</p>
<p class="contents">Cambodia, which suffered enormously under blanket bombing during the war and indescribable, murderous Khmer Rouge brutality, is now sadly suffering increasing authoritarian rule by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has arrested and issued defamation suits against critics who accuse him of selling territory to Vietnam in recent border negotiations as a way, of course, of silencing the political opposition in Cambodia. I call on Thailand not to extradite those who are seeking refuge on its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">In Laos, members of the Student Democracy Movement have been in jail since 1999. There is total control of written and broadcast media and attempts to put a stop to the internet with problems of human trafficking and forced prostitution. The Hmong people are living in constant fear of being attacked by Lao soldiers. I welcome the presence of the Royal Family of Laos, who are here in the distinguished visitors’ gallery today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that the assessment is never the same for the persecuted, for the imprisoned and, especially, for the families of the people condemned to death, as it is for those of us who, technically, are in a position to do this work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has committed itself to continuing to work with full respect for human rights in the case of these three countries. Of course, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">In these three countries we are faced with three different situations, but in all three cases we can say that there has been less progress than we would have liked in terms of civil freedoms and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In Cambodia, despite the fact that there has been some progress, we are still very far from being able to talk about political freedoms, particularly in the case of women and girls, who are victims of sexual trafficking, sexual tourism and of one of the most abject situations of slavery that any woman or girl can experience.</p>
<p class="contents">In Laos, as the Council and the Commission have said quite rightly, there are still prisoners of conscience and the entire hmong population is still being persecuted in the forests in an entirely sub-human situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Vietnam — as has also been said — we are seriously concerned about religious freedom, which, according to the information we have received from human rights organisations, may in some cases be being increasingly repressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Parliament can provide a voice for those places where human rights are being violated. This Parliament’s Human Rights Sub-Committee has worked hard to highlight the situation of these three countries and I believe that it is very important that any improvements or deterioration of the situation be communicated to this Parliament.</p>

Sam Rainsy has since lived in exile in France and Chea Poch has also escaped the country. Cheam Channy was arrested on that same day by military police. Recent arrests, not only of politicians, but also of journalists, trade union leaders and other members of civil society, bear witness to a worsening situation in terms of civil and political freedoms in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission and the Council to continue to bring the plight of the members of Sam Rainsy’s party to the attention of the Cambodian authorities. A country in which an opposition party is thwarted in its activities to this extent must be called to account in respect of its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also, though, like to urge the Commission and Council to mount an independent inquiry into the implementation of the Paris Peace Accord. Next year, it will be 15 years since the Paris Accord called a halt to the political conflict in Cambodia. It provided, among other things, for a constitution containing basic principles, including human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Accord also put in place effective measures to prevent former policy and practices from ever returning to that country.</p>
<p class="contents">In Vietnam, there are positive reports about economic progress in that country, which is to be welcomed. It is also positive that in November 2004, Vietnam provided the facilities for an EU seminar on the death penalty. Nevertheless, in 2004, at least 82 people were executed and 115 sentenced to death, and the real numbers are probably higher, because Vietnam treats numerical data on the death penalty as a state secret. In 2005, 24 actual executions have been reported so far, while 78 people have been sentenced to death. In this connection, I would also like to mention the persecution of Vietnam’s Unified Buddhist Church, which is of direct concern to my colleague Marco Pannella. I would call on the Commission and the Council to plead with the Vietnamese authorities for the total abolition of the death penalty, but in any event, in anticipation of this, the European Union must plead for the ban on executions and reducing the number of offences that lead to the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In Laos, although no executions have been reported over the past 11 years, the death penalty is still in force and in 2005, at least seven people, including one woman, have been sentenced to death.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I should like to ask the Council also to incorporate human rights in the broader framework of relations between Europe and the ASEAN countries, although it goes without saying that our relations with them have to do with more than just that. We have economic and political relations; together, we fight terrorism, the drugs trade; there are scientific exchanges, and all kinds of other things. In my view, we should be doing more with the ASEAN countries rather than less. Not least in view of China and India arriving on the scene, Vietnam is the linchpin in our relations with Asia, but human rights should form an integral part of this. I am pleased that the Commission and Council have also hammered this message home, and we must without a doubt continue down this path. I wholly endorse my group’s policy in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their testimonies were truly worrying, particularly in terms of fundamental rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">In Cambodia, as has been said, it is not just the attacks on democratic plurality — arbitrary persecutions and detentions of several leaders — that are alarming, but also, as Mrs Valenciano has pointed out, the doubly worrying situation of women and children in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">In Laos, the humanitarian situation is becoming increasingly serious and it does not just affect the hmong population, but also many other ethnic and national communities; and what is more, local authorities are denying humanitarian organisations access.</p>
<p class="contents">In Vietnam, many people are still in prison for having defended the right to free expression or to be members of certain communities, peacefully or by means of Internet activism.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, it seems to me to be reasonable, timely and necessary to call upon the Commission once again, and the Council too, to monitor these events closely and to promote the human rights working groups already in place in Laos and Vietnam. I am pleased to hear from the Commission that they are operating, but we would insist not just that they must operate properly, but that they must also report back. And one of the institutions to which they must report is this very House. We have been asking this for some time and we are also doing so within the context of the debate on another report: the Agnoletto report on the democratic clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing, therefore, is not just — I would insist — to work to deal with these issues, to work in favour of research and the monitoring of the policy implemented in those countries, but also — and this is the most important thing as far as I am concerned — to report on how this work is being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">To report — I insist — to the European organisations, but also to the population in question. Too often it is only those of us on the outside who know what is happening and how to solve it; sometimes it is also necessary for those on the inside to have access to that information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We very much welcome this fact, but it is a shame that to date, these reforms have not been accompanied by corresponding reforms in terms of politics and civil liberties, as noted in the motion for a resolution. Greater economic freedom is good news, but a serious lack of freedom of expression and of political and religious freedoms is quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The religious persecution suffered by Buddhists and Christians in Vietnam is particularly alarming. Buddhist and Christian leaders are being held in re-education camps, and this month alone has seen the arrest of 84 monks. The monks belong to the Unified Buddhist Church, which has been banned for 24 years and whose property has been confiscated. The Catholic priest Pham Minh Tri has been in prison for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">A new law on faith and religion came into force a year ago. It did not grant any real religious freedom, however, since the schools and universities that had been destroyed were not returned to the Buddhist community, to cite but one example. We are also all aware of the fact that ‘prisoners of conscience’, if I may put it that way, are being held in Laos and Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, greater economic freedom in this region is an admirable and commendable development. Yet the same does not apply to the ongoing violations of human rights, by which I also mean the right to practice one’s religion freely. Mutual relations between the European Union and Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia should be founded not only on greater economic freedom, but also on human rights, as noted by previous speakers. These should include the right to practice one’s own religion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 12 September 2005, Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights held a hearing on Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, as has been pointed out by previous speakers. For the ill-informed it was an eye-opener as to current human rights abuses, restrictions of freedoms and political and religious repression, with different accounts coming from each country. This motion follows previous resolutions and strongly worded paragraphs of the annual report on human rights produced by Parliament last year. The motion calls on the authorities of all three countries to make progress in specific areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Cambodia, the motion calls on the authorities to engage in political and institutional reforms, to release political prisoners, to combat corruption, deforestation and displacement of people and to take measures to combat the sex tourism industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Laos, we call on the authorities to release political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, develop a multi-party system where all views and opinions can be taken into account, respect religious minorities and their rights and allow UN agencies unrestricted access to all parts of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Vietnam, we call on the authorities to promote and to allow a multi-party system to reflect different viewpoints, to end all repression of religious minority groups such as the unified Buddhist church and to release Vietnamese political prisoners of conscience. At the same time, we recognise that there has been some movement in this area. We also call for the safe repatriation under the Cambodia/Vietnam UNHCR agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not unreasonable requests to make. They are consistent with the value system of the EU in relation to the promotion of human rights and democracy. The EU has formal ties with all three countries, with cooperation agreements on Cambodia and Laos in 1997 and Vietnam in 1995. All of these agreements have human rights clauses. They should mean something and there should be consequences if they are repeatedly breached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cambodia – where I was the chief election observer for the European Parliament in the last elections – is clearly a flawed democracy. It is very clear that the Cambodian People’s Party won that election. However, their treatment of Sam Rainsy and other members of his party is clearly unacceptable and the Council and the Commission should continue to press that message.</p>
<p class="contents">In Vietnam, there is a market-Leninist state with a strong reformist movement leading to gradual improvements. Nevertheless, the restriction on freedom of expression is something we should be pressing the country about, as well as the discrimination against the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam. The treatment of the indigenous minorities, particularly in the Central Highlands and in the north is unacceptable by any international standards, even if one allows for their negative role in the national liberation struggle in Vietnam in decades past.</p>
<p class="contents">The real problem, in my view, is in Laos, which is an authoritarian and essentially unreformed regime, where there are limits on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association and freedom of religion and there is no effective political opposition. I recall my colleague Olivier Dupuis, a former Member of the European Parliament, being arrested in Laos and going on hunger strike because of the inability to distribute material in that country. Later on, my colleague, Ms Morgan, will talk about the situation of the Lao-Hmong people in Laos, which is particularly appalling.</p>

That stipulation continues to be breached on a daily basis, but we still pump in aid as if all was well. All is very far from well. I have time only to refer to abuses of religious freedom. In Vietnam, persecution of Christians is rampant, being particularly dire in respect of minority Protestant Christian churches in Vietnam’s central highlands and the north. The Reverend Quang and his associates have been relentlessly hounded by the Communist authorities. When the President of the Vietnamese Committee on Human Rights addressed Parliament in December, he described Vietnam as a prison for its people, governed by a red mafia financed by the European taxpayer. He may have overstated our generosity, but that was a stinging indictment of the EU’s attitude to countries such as this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The purpose of today’s debate is to support strong and assertive action by all of us – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – in order to uphold fundamental human rights: the right to life and the promotion of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the end of military conflict – 30 years ago the war in Vietnam was coming to a close – and the fall of bloody communist regimes – such as that of Pol Pot – or violent anti-government <span class="italic">coups d’état</span> – as in Laos – the international community has been actively cooperating towards supporting former Indochina in terms of development and democracy within the international forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet 30 years on from events that were so terrible and tragic for part of the human race, what is the state of play today? Much has certainly been done, but not enough. Fundamental guarantees of human rights are still not being respected: the right to life and to freedom of assembly, expression and opinion, to say nothing of the right to religious worship and the restrictions placed on Christians and Catholics, as well as on the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">What, furthermore, can one say of the squalid, shameful sex tourism which goes unchecked and through which young women – children, almost – are thrown onto the streets like so much butcher’s meat? It is a disgrace which must be prevented and stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be recognised that some progress has been made with regard to the right to religious expression: several dozen priests were ordained in Vietnam a few days ago. It is necessary, however, to do more to win the battle for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In three years’ time we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. I hope that between now and then we can – via greater use of the instruments available to us, starting with financial instruments – achieve a genuine policy of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that to achieve this objective it is vital to involve the European Parliament in the work of the EU-Laos and EU-Vietnam working parties of the Council and Commission, with regard to administrative reforms, governance and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the middle of the last European elections, I watched a documentary about the plight of the Hmong people. I told myself then that I would take the first opportunity I had in this House to raise the plight of those people. I am glad to have this opportunity here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hmong people are an ethnic group that has been persecuted for many years for supporting the US during the Vietnam War. When the Communist Party took over in 1975, thousands of Hmong people died because they supported the US at the time. Many fled the country, but many others fled to the mountain jungles and are still there today, several decades on.</p>
<p class="contents">The documentary I watched showed a whole village – young children and old women and men – crying when the camera crew arrived because they believed that at last their plight would be shown to the world. The Hmong people of Laos have been attacked using helicopters and ground troops. They live a very basic existence and sometimes go without food for days on end despite being surrounded by edible berries: they would rather starve than give away any clues to the Laos authorities of their whereabouts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is fear that women and children, in particular, should not have to put up with in the 21st century. I therefore urge the Commission and Council to consider very seriously what aid, if any, should go to Laos without seeing considerable improvements, in particular with regard to the rights of the Hmong people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That we are repeating ourselves is irrelevant, for we cannot put the spotlight on these problems too often. Laos is under single-party rule, and any kind of opposition is out of the question. The country is cut off from the international community, without any freedom of opinion or belief, not to mention its being a centre of opium production and of the illegal trade in wood, and the mistreatment of juveniles that goes on there.</p>
<p class="contents">In Cambodia, the rights of women and children are disregarded, and the opposition and its supporters are suppressed. The law courts have no independence, parliamentarians lose their immunity from prosecution, and journalists end up behind bars.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite economic progress and a certain willingness to take human rights issues seriously, Vietnam, too, imposes the most stringent restrictions on the expression of opinion and the freedom of the press, and is still, lamentably, suppressing the practice of religions, whether that means persecuting Buddhists or Roman Catholic priests.</p>
<p class="contents">For as long as people are ending up in jail for their opinions and beliefs, this is a problem that should be addressed not only in a resolution by the European Parliament; the Council and the Commission, too, should help promote good governance, the development of institutions and the implementation of administrative reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid from the EU must only be given subject to these political conditions being met. It is with this in mind that the joint motion for a resolution expresses not merely a pious wish, but an appeal to all the institutions of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the area of human dignity and fundamental human rights we, as European politicians, have an opportunity and an obligation to defend these principles still more vehemently.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution, as has been said, is a good indication of how we can bring committee business to plenary level. The Subcommittee on Human Rights heard how there is real concern about the non-implementation of human rights in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps with regard to Cambodia, there was formerly the desire to give the country time to normalise and recover from the Khmer Rouge era, but the time limit is now fast approaching. When even the oppressed continue with the oppression, the rest of the world has to intervene in the issue of human rights. This inevitably means that we must consider imposing conditions to put pressure on governments. News, for example, of the detention of opposition politicians and reporters does not suggest that things are going the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community needs to pay very special attention to the status of women. It is a priority to promote the rights of groups that are all too easily discriminated against, such as women, children, and more especially girls, minorities, aboriginal peoples and the disabled, and it is excellent that the resolution should have focused attention on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not even have precise knowledge concerning the situation in Laos, as foreign human rights organisations are not allowed into the country. We do know, however, that we can hardly say that fundamental rights have been implemented there.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament is now giving its broad political support to the resolution, whilst at the same time pointing out the existence of earlier resolutions, we will obviously monitor developments in these countries closely, and if the situation does not improve we will certainly return to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although these countries are making economic reforms that are necessary for their development, they are forgetting the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens, especially those of ethnic and religious minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like more particularly to draw your attention to the situation of the Hmong population in Laos. These people have been persecuted by the people’s army continuously for 30 years because their parents or grandparents fought on the side of the United States in the Vietnam war. There are said to be nearly 20 000 of them surviving in the jungle under appalling conditions, conditions that fly in the face of the human rights principles we all support. They live off leaves and roots and are so insecure they are forced to move their villages regularly. Their children receive no education and suffer from malnutrition. Several hundred of them surrendered to the authorities, but they were arrested or disappeared. The central government denies the facts. The international community learned their story recently thanks to the media.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we opened our eyes and in particular strongly condemned this campaign of repression, extermination even, that is being conducted with complete impunity. We must call on the Laotian Government to allow international and non-governmental organisations free access to the areas concerned – that is the only way those people will get the food and care they need – and, above all, press the government to integrate these populations into Laotian society with the fundamental rights and freedoms they have been denied until today. We know that the Laotian economy depends on aid from foreign donors, much of it from the European Union; the international community and the European Union therefore have means of bringing pressure to bear on the country’s authorities. We hope, Madam President, that the Commission and the Council will heed these calls and help the populations of South-East Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The governments of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam can be under no illusion that the Council takes human rights seriously. These governments are fully aware of the strength of feeling within the Council, within the EU Member States and within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, I visited Cambodia and Laos where I attended the ASEAN Regional Forum. I went and saw a project in Cambodia which was taking vulnerable young people off the streets and doing absolutely terrific work. I also saw a project being supported by the UK Government, which is providing training for police officers in Cambodia to crack down on child sex tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that a lot of other EU Member States are funding similar projects in other countries that are doing good work. I believe it is very important that we should be open and frank with governments where human rights abuses exist, but we should also offer words of encouragement where positive progress is made.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that today in the media, there is a report that sixty new Roman Catholic priests were ordained in a mass ceremony in Vietnam yesterday. That is a welcome development, but we should not forget that human rights abuses still exist in that country, as they do also in Cambodia and in Laos. We have had some very eloquent contributions explaining and cataloguing those human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Honourable Members here today continue to take every opportunity to visit these countries to find out the situation for themselves and to raise directly their human rights concerns within the governments of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was in Cambodia, I certainly raised the issue of Sam Rainsy and his party directly with Prime Minister Hun Sen. At the ASEAN Regional Forum, Javier Solana and I also discussed human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will continue to raise its concerns with these governments. This means being open, honest and frank where those governments are failing to live up to international standards. But we must base our concerns on authoritative information; we have to get our facts right. We must also recognise and encourage progress where it is made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I firmly believe that through this approach we are placing ourselves not only on the right side, but also on the winning side, the side of gradual change.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a very different situation pertains in the three countries that have been discussed in detail. We must not forget, however, that this situation is the product of a tragic history. The developments of the last few decades clearly show that the situation has substantially improved, although it is still far from satisfactory. Against this background, the European Commission, together with the Presidency and the Council, will continue to engage in constructive dialogue and apply political pressure for the democratisation in these three South-East Asian countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to the question on the provision of information and reports. The Commission is prepared to make available the details of discussions held by the EU joint working group on these countries, and I firmly believe that the drafting and/or approving the clause on human rights and democracy in our cooperation agreements will also make an important contribution to these principles and values in international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put forward one example that is important from the perspective of people to people communication. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend the opening of the second meeting of EU and ASEAN university rectors held in Leuven near Brussels. It was a truly inspiring event that included a discussion on how to create the conditions for improving not only the dialogue but also the environment for freedom and democracy in these countries. Through continuing such relations, for example by inviting students from these countries onto programmes and projects such as Erasmus Mundus, I firmly believe that we may help to bring about better conditions in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
