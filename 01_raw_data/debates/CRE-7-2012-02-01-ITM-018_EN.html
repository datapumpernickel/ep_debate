<p class="contents">Today the sports world is mourning those who died at a football match in Egypt. I would like to express my strong condemnation, and to remember the victims and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">While drawing up this report I was in constant contact with the sports world, hearing people’s concerns and trying to reflect the issues on which the EU is being asked to express its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has caused a revolution in the sports world because, for the first time, it was given its own legal basis, in Article 165. The first response to the Treaty was the Commission communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which follows the guidelines set out in the 2007 White Paper. Parliament responded with an own-initiative report of the same name. The report was approved by the Committee on Culture and Education by 28 votes in favour and 2 votes against.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two concepts related to sport, of which I was very aware when writing the report. Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity, which recognises the competences of Member States and, secondly, the concept of the specific nature of sport, as mentioned in Article 165. However, this is not a universal principle, but rather one that must be analysed and approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the autonomy of governance structures in sport should be respected as a fundamental principle for its organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to briefly highlight some points made in the report. First of all, volunteering, when thousands of citizens selflessly take part to ensure that countless sporting events can be held. We must give them our unconditional support.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, doping. Doping substances are a blight on sport and society. We should educate people on prevention, convict traffickers, pursue cheats and harmonise sanctions between sports law and civil law, maintaining the greatest possible respect for sportspeople. The report urges Member States to treat trafficking in illegal substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs and to adopt national legislation to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to support the practice of sport in schools, and we therefore call for sport to be part of their curriculum.</p>
<p class="contents">At some point, sportspeople’s professional careers come to an end, and during their career they need to have access to high-quality academic training in order to later become integrated into the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, racism, xenophobia and homophobia are present in sport, and it is therefore necessary to implement new measures to eliminate any signs of those threats at sporting events.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the undeniable benefit that sport has on people’s health, leading to a significant reduction in public health spending. I would also highlight the importance of sport as a means of integration for the most vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and socially excluded groups, as well as for those with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Betting should be protected from unauthorised activities, and from suspected match fixing, in particular by recognising organisers’ property rights with regard to their competitions. The report also calls on Member States to take legal action against sports fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fundamentally important that commercial exploitation of audiovisual rights for sport competitions should be carried out on a centralised, territorial basis with a view to guaranteeing that revenues are distributed fairly between elite and mass-participation sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to the proposal to establish a European Day of Sports and an Erasmus Sports Programme, and to protect indigenous sports as part of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a few of the issues dealt with in the report, and I hope I can count on Parliament’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Commissioner responsible for sport I cannot but express my deep regret for what has happened in Egypt today, which shows exactly why we have to work to find a healthy way of conducting sport at all sporting events.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank, first of all, the rapporteur Mr Fisas Ayxela and the shadow rapporteurs for all their work in producing this excellent report on the European dimension in sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to note that Parliament endorses the proposals contained in the Commission communication adopted last January. The Commission will carefully consider all the suggestions made in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are now implementing a coherent set of actions in the field of sport and we are doing this on the basis of the priorities agreed by the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the Commission’s communication on sport and the Council’s work plan, Parliament’s new report completes a solid policy framework which will guide the EU as it develops the European dimension in sport over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly mention some of the initiatives that the Commission is, or will, be carrying out in line with the suggestions made in Parliament’s report. These cover the following policy priorities: health and participation, anti-doping, statistics, sustainable financing, good governance, education and training. Several of the report’s suggestions will be developed by the expert groups set up by the EU work plan in order to prepare concrete policy deliverables.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with Parliament’s report, the Commission has been implementing a number of actions that were set out in our communications. These include recent studies on the funding of grassroots sport and on the contribution of sport to economic growth and employment in the EU, and forthcoming studies on health-enhancing physical activity, on economic and legal aspects of the transfer of players and on a possible sports monitory function in the EU. We have also organised two EU conferences on statistics and sports agents, which were very well received.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, thanks to Parliament’s support, a third year of preparatory actions has been launched to address the fight against violence, racism and discrimination in sport and to promote good governance in sports organisations. These initiatives would not be complete if we were not able to secure sustainable multiannual EU funding to support our policy. Parliament is right in requesting that the Commission propose an ambitious budget for sports policy under the future Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to Parliament’s support the Commission has proposed a new programme – Erasmus for All – which includes a substantial chapter on sport. The new programme responds to our Europe 2020 goals and sport, as an economic and social sector in its own right, has an important part to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important thing for me in presenting the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was to emphasise that sport makes an important contribution to the economy, alongside its well-known health and social benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that we can generate added value in this area at a European level. However, I believe that the subsidiarity principle should continue to play a central role in sport. Sport must remain close to the people. This works most effectively when it is organised on a national, regional and local level. Over and above the points mentioned, the European Union should restrict itself to establishing a suitable legal framework. This applies, for example, to the public funding of sport, competition rules and also competitions and usage rights. Therefore, I welcome the fact that these considerations have been included in the report and I can give the text my full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for his report. I do find it particularly sad, however, that an amendment that has been adopted by both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, namely concerning a dialogue between the Commission and professional sports organisations, was not adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education. That means that we are denying that professional sports need to comply with economic legislation within Europe and that – when it comes to European competitions – there is still inadequate equality.</p>
<p class="contents">We see minimum ages for sports contracts, which is not a good thing. We see that there are enormous differences in how professional sports are treated when it comes to taxation. We see a great many cases that contradict one another. It is therefore necessary for the Commission to enter into dialogue with the professional sports organisations in order to ensure that professional sports fall into line so that, in future, we can benefit enormously from these sports and so that our young people learn from them. That is what I am calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">In other regards, I endorse the content of Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report, but I believe it is a pity that the opinion of the Committees on Legal Affairs and on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection were not incorporated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport holds a mirror to our society on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the EU to launch a sound European sports policy and tackle abuses. Unfortunately it seems from the Commission’s proposals and the conclusions of the Sports Council that good intentions are not going to be followed up with concrete action in order to effectively tackle these abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, in 2010, as many as 1100 young people were transferred in football using an exception. A complete ban is needed in order to protect these young people. An end also needs to be put to dicey practices by dishonest players’ agents by means of a registration system with job specifications, a code of conduct, mechanisms for punishment and a European blacklist.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, Europe has been plagued by racist incidents in sport. The EU needs to show greater leadership and to demonstrate that it takes its own motto – ‘Unity in diversity’ – seriously by putting in place legislation that prohibits discrimination in the workplace. It needs to set up effective campaigns in order to make clear that discrimination is unacceptable. This is enormously important in these days of rampant populism and right-wing extremism.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminals on or alongside the sports field work across borders. That means that we need to tackle them at that level. Sporting fraud needs to be incorporated into the criminal law of every Member State. Europe needs to make clear to sporting organisations that cooperation with Europol and Eurojust is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, a European sports policy is desperately needed and can act as an example. As it stands, the initial proposals for a new sports policy have been too non-committal. Fair play and fraternity on the sports field are still the most important goal, but that is only possible with a strong sports policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wanted to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fisas Ayxela, for doing an excellent job: it is a really comprehensive report which sends out an important signal in the field of sport. The rapporteur has worked well, including with all the shadow rapporteurs, and of course I thank them too for the result. Finally, I also wish to send my greetings to Commissioner Vassiliou.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it really is a good sign that we are holding this debate and have completed this report in the year when the Olympics will be taking place, the crowning moment for sport worldwide, a time when sport turns into a vehicle for the global exchange of values and friendship. For this reason, we have stressed that sport is a tool for combating discrimination, bearing in mind how difficult it still is, for example, for women to play sports in some countries, such as Iran, which therefore worries us not only because of its decisions on nuclear power.</p>
<p class="contents">Another significant factor is the idea of supporting the designation of a European capital of sport under the leadership of ACES, the European Capitals of Sport Association. As we have learnt from the European Capitals of Culture, the promotion of activities for the young and old is at its height under such initiatives. The report also includes the fight against doping, a focus on gambling and the rediscovery of traditional games.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, in short, that we have done a good job in terms of honouring as far as possible the EU’s new competence in sport under the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed each paragraph separately and sought to ensure that every political group features in this report, and that it is a report which does not contain any differences of opinion but, if anything, includes everyone’s views. This is where credit goes to Santiago Fisas because he managed to get us all to sing from the same hymn sheet. However, given how important sport is in the European Union, hundreds of amendments were tabled. Once again, particular credit is due to the rapporteur in that the report itself provides more than just a detailed analysis of sport in the European Union. This report has not been confined only to depicting the current state of sport in the European Union. On the contrary, it contains innovative sections and ideas, as well as bold ideas which we supported and debated, while some were removed and others remained in the draft. It is of paramount importance that sensitive subjects were dealt with, such as the status of minors involved in sport, betting on sport, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware, and we have also seen the opinion from the specialist committees, that sport is much more than a recreational activity. It has extremely important implications for health, education, reducing violence, the economy and so on, as well as for increasing productivity and for every factor signifying a stable, dynamic economy in the future. As a result, I believe that allocating only 1% of the budget to the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme is far too little for sport, given the implications that sport has in the European Union. This is why I say that we need to campaign for more money for sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report has drawn attention from across a wide interest spectrum: from athletes, volunteers, sporting organisations and the media. Sport is intrinsic to the lives of European citizens, it crosses social divides and borders, it unites people and it enriches our lives. A European sports policy is not about harmonisation, it is not about taking the soul of competition out of sport and it should not be narrowed down to a debate on the presence of the EU flag. The compromise text is flexible and it remains up to sporting organisations and Member States to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">The excellent recommendations in this report on supporting volunteers, strengthening and improving access to training, education for coaches and athletes, promoting traditional sports, eliminating doping and tackling corruption in sport should not be overshadowed. This is a report that provides us with a strong framework for creating a European sports policy based on social inclusion and enhancing sport in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As an MEP from a Member State that boasts the world’s largest amateur and volunteer sporting organisation – that is the Gaelic Athletic Association, with one million amateur members – I am pleased that this report has acknowledged the important role which volunteers play. There are 35 million amateurs involved in sporting organisations in Europe. The role of volunteers and amateurs is central to the continued success of sporting organisations in every community, and that is why it is essential that the Commission allocates a budget to sports policy. Sport is a vehicle that delivers on broader EU aims across several policy areas, such as Community development, active ageing and healthy and active living. It has a successful economic dimension and it is a social phenomenon that delivers an invaluable public good.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to highlight the importance of the right of journalists to access and report on sporting events. There is public appetite for sports news and we must be sure to safeguard the right of the public to obtain and receive independent news and information on sporting events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our political group welcomes the EU-level action in the field of sport being mentioned in the Commission’s communication. We also support the proposals included in Parliament’s motion for a resolution. In particular we are fully satisfied that the report voices the concern regarding support for traditional sport and games as an important part of our diverse cultural heritage. Member States should take measures to protect them, since some traditional games and sports are in danger of disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">The main matters of concern are some social aspects of the life of professional sportsmen and women, many of whom face an uncertain future at the end of their sporting careers. This problem was outlined especially by the leaders of the Latvian Trade Union of Sport and Tourism during our discussions on the subject. Europe should promote its social model and improve social standards concerning such a specific category of employees as professional athletes. I hope the appeal to the Member States to consider ways of alleviating the financial burden on the lowest-paid professional sportspersons will be acknowledged. Nevertheless, the implementation of a common European definition of the procedure and determination of terms for professional athletes and coaches retiring is welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we support the suggestion in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs to call on the Commission to initiate a dialogue with all EU professional sports organisations on how to tackle problems arising from differences in the Member States regarding employment contracts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only does it generate billions of euros and many thousands of jobs, but it also provides health and joy to millions. I am passionate about sport myself.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s new supporting competence in sport should have provided it with the opportunity to explore ways the EU could help grassroots sport through volunteering initiatives and community sports development etc., but sadly this report misses the opportunity. It has turned into a matter of how the EU can take advantage of the popularity of professional sport – what sport can do for the EU instead of what the EU can do for sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The report focuses mainly on professional football. It takes little account of minority or grassroots sport – where I believe the focus should have been. The EU can have a role in influencing some aspects of sport – the fight against doping and cross-border gambling etc., but the report goes much too far in calling for the EU itself, rather than individual Member States, to sign up to WADA and to doping conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also ignores the limits of EU power by proposing special tax regimes and impinging on the right of Member States to decide on their educational curricula, and touches on social security provisions. All of these are in the realm of the Member State and not of the EU. But most damaging is the attempt to make national sports teams wear the EU flag on their shirts and to fly the EU flag at all sporting events. At first this was compulsory and now it is voluntary, but the proposal to have the EU flag on national teams is still outrageous and unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport has a very special place in the United Kingdom, and our national sports teams form a key part of our identities and our heritage. The EU is trying to impose an artificial European identity on us by forcing our athletes to wear its emblem. Does this add value to sport? No it does not. It is simply an attempt to add value to the EU itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons, amongst others, that I will be unable to vote in favour of this report tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">This report finally recognises that sport, and the wider range of physical and sporting activities, has educational, cultural, health and social – or societal – dimensions. It emphasises the role of volunteers and the importance of studying the feasibility of a suitable legal and tax framework. How could we be anything but glad about that?</p>
<p class="contents">It underlines the importance of developing and, therefore, of investing in grassroots sport, as well as the need to redistribute investments between professional sport and grassroots sport.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to highlight the importance of public funding, the only means to truly guarantee equality of access without discrimination, and the need for real partnership with the sports movement. The Member States obviously have a major role to play, including establishing respect for ethics in sports and guaranteeing the health of sportspeople, be they amateurs or professionals.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I have some regrets as to the inadequacy of the regulatory role of the Member States with regard to the abuse occurring in this sector. One example is that of online games and sports betting. We put forward a proposal reaffirming the need for a monopoly by the Member States in this area, in accordance with the ECJ ruling of 8 September 2009. Unfortunately, it was not accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have also liked to see more encouragement for States to guarantee the economic and social rights of sportspeople, particularly in terms of training and the right to retraining.</p>
<p class="contents">However, words are not enough. We need action. The prism of the internal market and competition needs to be returned to its rightful place, and physical activity and sport need to be recognised for what they are, that is, an excellent tool for individual and collective freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are we now going to see the EU flag at the British Olympics, at the Champions League Final or even on the shirt of the England captain? This is nothing more than sheer EU propaganda and vanity. The EU has never been so unpopular, yet here you are, wanting to stamp your flag on sporting stars in the hope that you can force the people to love you. But they will not.</p>
<p class="contents">What you propose also seems to break the rules of sporting competitions. For example, under Law 4, Decision 1 of the FIFA laws of the game, it states: ‘The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or FIFA.’ What right do you think the EU has to interfere in sport in such a way to encourage countries to break the rules? It is hypocritical, because the EU is in effect a political organisation. You even say in paragraph 20 of the report that political propaganda should be banned, which is hypocritical. Athletes proudly wear the flag of their own national countries. They should not wear the flag of the European Union.</p>

Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) covers the EU’s new responsibility in the field of sport. The importance of sport for our society in areas such as promoting health, encouraging tolerance, stimulating the economy and tourism and developing organisations is very clear in the area where I come from, the state of Salzburg. Sporting activities are a permanent feature in the lives of almost every family, both in summer and in winter. This report also seems particularly important to me with regard to the significance of sport for older people and with regard to the call for women to be better represented on the decision-making bodies in sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Doping and corruption in sport and the constructive proposals to resolve these problems will hopefully only be mentioned on this one occasion.

Exercise converts adrenaline into energy and is a primary creator of endorphins. Exercise advances self-confidence and can afford someone a new lease of life.

I am pleased that we have a President who is keen on sports in Parliament, even if it is just for a while. I also wish to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for an excellent report, and, likewise, the Commissioner, who has done an excellent job in the Commission in the area of sport. It is of course true that sport is Europe’s biggest popular movement. It needs to be spoken about, and it is important that we also stake out a clear role for it in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that a legal basis has been established, it is important that we move towards real solutions. This report provides excellent guidance on what is achieved through sport, because we know its effects on health, and we know its other social effects in terms both of well-being and integrating people society. We also know how sport is important when we are fighting against racism and many other unpleasant phenomena at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to ensure that there is funding. In this connection, I would like to say that I obviously hope that there will be adequate funds in the budgetary framework for sport, allowing us to reach its grassroots. However, it is also important to protect national monopolies. Veikkaus, the Finnish national lottery and sports betting company, is a good example of how to fund activities at grassroots level. It will need to remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say something about this issue of the EU flag, which the British Tories have made so much of. Surely it does not bother anyone now if the flag occasionally flies in the European Union. I am sure, besides, that it does not have to be used for team strips. However, perhaps the biggest piece of news for me today was when Mr Nuttall, talking about football, said that countries should support the idea that Great Britain will one day play as its own single team, under the flag of one Great Britain. I have to say that this is an unexpected point of view, and I think that it is a very welcome one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report has been through seven committees and I have shadowed it on behalf of the ECR Group in two of them. I had intended to talk today about the British women who are sporting heroes to millions, such as Rebecca Adlington, Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. I wanted to talk to you today about how excited my home constituency of London is to welcome the world’s Olympic and Paralympics athletes later this year. But I cannot. Because I have to use this speech to denounce this report’s calls to fly EU flags at major sporting events and for the flag to be displayed on athletes’ clothing. I must also condemn the proposals to waste money on the European capital of sport at this time of austerity. The Brussels bubble needs to remember that we live in hard times.</p>

It is a report which may result in major changes in the new sports policy. It is a report for which millions of people involved in sport and thousands of organisations have been waiting for a long time. I would like to express my thanks for Mr Fisas Ayxela’s prodigious and outstanding piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the shape of sports policy in the coming years is going to depend on us, on Parliament, but also on Ms Vassiliou, and on the extent to which the important proposals included in the report are actually put into practice. I think that keeping the three elements of the social role of sport, the economic dimension and the whole organisation of sport is absolutely right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on several extremely important factors which it will finally be possible to correct or improve by means of European sports policy. There is the question of the regulation of sports agents and the transparency of the system – the whole system – the aim of which is to identify young talent. There is also the question, which you wrote about in the report, Mr Fisas Ayxela, of minimum qualifications for the important and responsible profession of sports agent. There is the whole area of the package for funding fair play in sport, which is extremely important in particular from the point of view of the system for training and identifying young talent. There is the question of the whole problem in sport related to match-fixing, to which we must react at EU level, because this procedure often even has links with organised crime. There is the question of the huge influence of sports tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we still face, in fact, and the Commissioner still faces, the question of making the best use of structural funds, and in particular the European Social Fund, so as to improve the sports base but also to give all sportspeople who end their career the opportunity to become professionals who, thanks to the fund, can pass on their sporting knowledge. Finally, I would like to say that what makes the report is so good is that it has come in an Olympic Games year and the year of the Euro 2012 football championship, so I hope it will be very well received by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sport has huge potential for improving overall health at any age. Sport can be a means of integrating socially excluded people and eliminating all forms of discrimination. Giving priority to inter-generational sports can take many forms with benefits for public health, and with social, cultural and economic benefits for society. Sport is also a good way for young people to use their free time and to avoid drugs, violence and other negative phenomena.</p>

<p class="contents">As regards this report, I must say that I am delighted to take part in the debate, particularly since I have been involved with sport my whole life: as a player, as President of the Gaelic Athletic Association and as Executive Chairman of the Irish Institute of Sport. We now have a report that allows us to implement Article 165 of the Treaty of Lisbon. I commend Santiago Fisas Ayxela and everyone else who helped compile this report. </p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased with the report, particularly as some amendments that I tabled have been taken on board, especially in relation to grassroots sport, which gives effect to the written declaration that the Members so kindly passed here last year. Also the possibility of growth in sports tourism, and the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund to be used to develop infrastructure in sport, particularly in indigenous sports, of which the GAA, as my colleague Liam Aylward mentioned, is a shining example in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">But as the Commissioner mentioned – and I was pleased to hear her mention it – the MFF and the budget are going to be crucial. One argument we can certainly put forward in this context is that sport implies, directly or indirectly, 15 million people contributing 3.6% of GDP in the European Union. There are many more arguments, but that certainly justifies a good sports budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other suggestions which I am very pleased about. I see nothing wrong, by the way, with the suggestion about the European flag; after all, where do you expect to fly the European flag – outside the European Union or inside it? That is one argument. Also the European Day of Sport and the European Capitals of Sport, which is a wonderful development (I have seen that in my own country as well recently), and the Erasmus for All programme. There are a lot of good suggestions, and with a good budget we will make a lot of progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the point of view of community, social cohesion and health, sport has such obvious advantages that we cannot stand still any longer. In fact, it cannot be stressed highly enough and I believe that it is important that we should therefore also pave the way for measures that guarantee the integrity of sport to the maximum possible degree and beef up the fight against excesses and illegal practices.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, Mr President, Commissioner, I have a message for some of our eurosceptic British friends who, in the meantime, seem to have vanished from the Chamber. Look at what has happened in Egypt today, where dozens of fans have died in football violence. Look at what happened in Vienna today, where dozens of fans were arrested and found guilty by the courts as a result of violence in football stadia.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need a European sports policy. I will quote verbatim from Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report, which calls on Member States ‘to refuse access to stadiums to supporters who have displayed violent or discriminatory behaviour’ and ‘to ensure that stadium bans remain in force for international matches’. That is what it says in the report. It is a hot topic at this point in time and that is why we do need this European sports policy and why, Commissioner, you will have our 100% backing.</p>
<p class="contents">A database to exchange information about hooligans guilty of violence and racism is something that I think would be much more efficient to organise at European level. As other Members have already said, the same also applies to combating doping, betting fraud and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, let us concentrate on that instead of spending the whole evening here spouting hot air about the possibility of displaying a European flag on T-shirts – a proposal that, by the way, Mr Kelly, I am 100% behind because it is indeed on a voluntary basis, with 100% observance of the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this in mind, synergies between sport and tourism must be identified, especially through modernising collective infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of synergy between regional development, sport, transport and tourism is the tourist potential offered by cycling. The EuroVelo project, which already has 14 routes in Europe covering more than 70 000 kilometres, is an example of making a contribution to positive values, promoting social integration, strengthening communities, health promotion and urban development. I should emphasise the importance of the cycle route extending along the whole course of the Danube in supporting the development of tourism in the Danube region. I must also stress the role played by local, regional and national authorities in developing the European dimension of sport, especially through devising urban mobility plans and allocating finances for developing the infrastructures required for sporting activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Modern society suffers from a lack of physical activity, which has an unfavourable effect on the health of our citizens, especially in the spread of obesity and associated health complications. We therefore need to see greater support for sport also as support for health, which will surely have positive consequences in terms of lower healthcare costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Promotion of a healthy, active way of life for our citizens, with a greater number of sporting activities, should be one of the EU’s main priorities in this area. Another important priority should be support for a European framework of sporting competitions in individual kinds of sport, in order to bring people together on the basis of common interests. I firmly believe that well-organised support for sport from the Commission will also improve the EU’s image in the eyes of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has numerous positive elements, but there are also many negative aspects. Money is often a more decisive factor in sport than sporting performance. Problems such as violence in sports grounds, racism and drug-taking are cancers that destroy sport. Rules must be established to address these problems’.</p>

I should stress that attention must be paid to both professional and amateur sport. It is well known that investing in sporting activities reduces public expenditure on health significantly. I therefore support not only the elderly but children too getting involved in sport. Providing schools with the equipment they need for PE lessons is vital for encouraging children to fulfil the minimum number of three hours of sport recommended by the European Parliament. These are just some of the arguments in favour of having a budget specifically for sport in the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework, so that we comply with a provision granted to the EU by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Violence, match fixing, sports agents and many issues are challenges with which we have to deal very urgently.</p>

Their higher involvement in competitive or mass sport would not only improve their physical and mental health but would also serve as an effective tool for social inclusion and education. Moreover, extending the sport sector could also function as an employment creation factor, particularly in disadvantaged regions. The full access to sport should therefore not only be viewed as a matter of leisure, but as a social service of general social and economic interest. Member States must take appropriate measures to increase the number of socially disadvantaged children in competitive and leisure sport activities and to improve skills and develop a positive attitude to an active life for disadvantaged youth, and the Structural Funds could be mobilised in order to develop sport facilities and opportunities so that disadvantaged children can engage in sport outside school in disadvantaged regions.

Furthermore, I think it would be a good idea to make it possible to use the European Social Fund to pay for the employment of instructors and trainers to run extra sports lessons in schools and facilities for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The social role of sport deserves to be highlighted. Sport is of huge importance for personal development, particularly that of children and young people, and is also an effective tool for social integration. It also plays a significant role in the fight against all forms of discrimination and social exclusion. This is why it is so important, in my opinion, to promote sport and support every kind of sporting initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recent estimates indicate that 15 million people are employed directly or indirectly in the sporting sector in the EU. According to the same estimates, this sector amounts to 3.65% of EU GDP. Major sporting events such as the Olympic Games or the European Football Championships attract millions of spectators and have a considerable impact economically and in terms of jobs. However, the potential offered by sport as an industry has not been fully tapped yet, even though Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union now contains the legal bases for including sport as part of existing European programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Commission to include sport as part of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) programmes. This step would significantly improve the conditions for funding sports-related projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the fact that the European Commission has made room for sport in the new Erasmus for All programme for education and young people in the new 2014-2020 budget period.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have been able, along with our colleagues, to influence the future of European sport as a force for social integration and reinforcement of a European identity, and to promote important elements such as mandatory physical education in schools and equal opportunities in sport for women and girls and the physically disabled, ensuring that they have access to appropriate sporting facilities. It is also important to create effective rules, ensuring that young sportsmen and sportswomen study properly at school and have proper professional development alongside their sporting activities. It is important to see sport as an instrument for combating intolerance, racism and violence, and also to increase protection for underage young people in professional sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commission will submit an ambitious budget for sports policy, taking account of the public health aspects, and the social, cultural and economic benefits, and that these proposals will be implemented in practice as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is imperative to guarantee equal access for women and men to sport – affordable, age-appropriate sport – in particular for girls and women from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. We need to ensure and promote access to disciplines which are adapted to the needs and aspirations of women. It is also important to ensure parity in membership of sporting decision-making bodies and in access to the positions of trainer and administrator in sporting associations. Despite the rise in the participation of women in sport which has taken place in recent years, their participation in decision-making and managerial roles has not increased. As long as there is a lack of women in management and decision-making positions, and by the same token a lack of female role models in sport, the objective of equal opportunities for women and girls will be impossible to achieve. As part of education and sport I propose running awareness campaigns targeted at nurseries and schools, to awaken an interest in sport among children and young people. It is important to increase, diversify and extend the programme of physical education by including lessons on issues related to training for women, such as differences in tempo and expected levels of achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon sport became a competence of the European Union is a turning point in the development of sport on a European scale. It is unquestionably paramount that the European Commission propose a dedicated budget for the funding of sports policy under the future Multiannual Financial Framework. It is also important to establish a training and qualifications framework for coaches and their education, to encourage women to be more involved in professional sport and to condemn violation of the principle of fair play. Rivalry between professionals is often full of negative emotions which definitely go beyond the bounds of competition. In the context of the whole of society such a situation is not acceptable in view of the power of the behaviour of sportspeople to influence others, particularly young people. It is important to note the urgent need to rebuild the values which we find in the concept of fair play in sport. It is also important to combat doping with the help of preventative campaigns and information campaigns, and to treat trade in these substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs. Coordinated action aimed at achieving a uniform approach to setting and enforcing sanctions against supporters who have displayed violent or discriminatory behaviour will help improve the level of safety at stadiums during sporting events. Finally, I would also like to express my support for the establishment of a non-public European register of sports agents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
