<p>On recent Olympic Airways flights from Athens to Germany, on Saturday, 2 September to Munich (flight OA 175) and on Wednesday, 6 September to Frankfurt (flight OA 165) I witnessed a breach of the Community’s principle of the free movement of persons and in particular the application of the Schengen Agreement in the European Union: German police officers were stationed at the aircraft exit and requiring the passengers to show their passports before allowing them to leave the aircraft. In response to my efforts to explain to them that this action was a breach of the Schengen Agreement they replied provocatively that they were carrying out the orders of the airport police authorities and they were not concerned about any consequences.</p>
<p>What action does the Council intend to take to remedy this situation, which is an affront to the dignity of the European public and will undermine its belief in European unification?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Until very recently, Greece, which has been a member of the Schengen group since 6 November 1992, has not been a fully functioning member of the Schengen area of free movement. The 1990 Convention applying the Schengen Agreement distinguishes between the entry into force of the Convention and its application (the effective waiver of internal border checks). On the basis of a new report drawn up following a monitoring mission in Greece, a decision on waiving border checks at its borders within the Schengen area met with political consensus at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 2 December 1999. Checks on persons at internal borders were officially waived, as anticipated, as of 26 March 2000. Since that time, the situation of Greece has been exactly the same as that of its partners.</p>
<p>According to Article 2(2) of the 1990 Schengen Convention, the elimination of checks on individuals at internal borders is not limiting upon the competent Member State authorities’ policing of their own territory. This provision does not exclude the possibility of carrying out spot checks. In practice, spot checks can take the form of checking a small percentage of passengers, or even all the passengers on one flight, carried out for practical reasons on leaving the aircraft. The remainder of flights would, however, not be checked.</p>
<p>In both the cases mentioned by the honourable Member, the German authorities have encountered a number of specific and repeated instances of passengers entering their territory without the necessary travel documents. This explains their decision to carry out spot checks.</p>
<p>The German authorities do not therefore appear to have exceeded the prerogatives to which they are entitled under the provisions of the Schengen Convention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0737"></a>

<p>The definition of Europe Agreements applies to the association agreements signed between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and ten Central and Eastern European countries, on the other hand, namely Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia. All these were signed and came into force between 1994 and 1999.</p>
<p>It must, however, be pointed out that the first six Europe Agreements (with the exception, therefore, of those signed with the three Baltic countries and Slovenia) were signed prior to the latest enlargement of the European Union. Consequently, protocols adjusting the institutional aspects of the Europe Agreements have proved necessary in order to enable Austria, Finland and Sweden individually to become contracting parties to the Agreements, even if these agreements are already binding on the three most recent Member States under the terms of Article 5 of the accession treaty.</p>
<p>These protocols of adjustment are probably what the honourable Member’s question is referring to. The six protocols were signed in 1999. Ratification procedures are still in progress; only a few Member States and one of the six associated countries have notified ratification. The Council is, of course, well aware of the importance of ensuring that the protocols enter into force quickly, but it can do no more than appeal to the Member States and the accession countries to do all they can to expedite the national ratification procedures, which lie entirely within the national remit and vary from one country to the next.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0739"></a>

<p>In a few days, the school year will begin for Greek pupils in Albania, though essential books for Greek lessons and, in particular, the history of the Greek nation will not be available. Moreover, the Albanian authorities have not yet replied to the minority’s long-standing request for the Greek school at Chimara (closed since 1946) to be re-opened. The Albanian Government’s position in this respect is in breach of the Greek minority’s constitutional right to education in their mother tongue, as upheld by the court at The Hague, and ignores the constitutional law on human rights adopted by the Albanian Government in March 1993.</p>

<p>Internal issues, including human rights issues, are on the agenda at each of our meetings with Albania, and the EU continues to monitor these matters with the utmost vigilance.</p>
<p>Since Albania is a country eligible for a stabilisation and association agreement, the way it conducts itself with regard to respect for democratic principles, human rights and minority rights is a significant indicator for the future development of its relations with the European Union. Given that approximation with European Union structures is one of the strategic objectives of the Tirana Government, the Union can exert considerable leverage in order to contribute to improving the situation of minorities in Albania.

<p>The Council calls the attention of the honourable Member to the conclusions drawn by the European Council in Cologne, notably on the need to step up work to establish more effective rules on private sector involvement in the costs of turbulence in the financial markets. Those conclusions also underline that all efforts to improve the functioning of the international financial system should remain within the framework of the existing Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
<p>A great deal of work at Community and international level has already been done on these issues. A report prepared by the Economic and Financial Committee in an ad-hoc Group under the chairmanship of Mr Henk Brower, deputy governor of the Dutch Central Bank, took stock of new developments which could have important implications for the stability of the financial system and outlined a number of recommendations endorsed by the Finance Ministers of the European Union. This report is available from the Council website.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the IMFC (International Monetary and Financial Committee of the Board of Governors of the IMF) Spring meeting reached an agreement on the framework of principles and tools by which private sector involvement in the resolution and prevention of financial crisis is to be obtained. The Council welcomes this agreement as a step forward to adoption of a broad and comprehensive approach to the most obvious regulatory loopholes of the international financial system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0751"></a>

<p>1. In accordance with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in October 1999, the French Presidency has made the integration of foreign nationals, with a view to their access to Member State citizenship, one of its top priorities. A seminar was therefore held in Paris on 5 and 6 October. The results of this seminar will enable the Presidency to present a draft text to be used as a basis for the Commission’s initiatives on harmonising residence permits in the long term.</p>
<p> Moreover, in order to make progress in implementing European citizenship and freedom of movement, four European Union countries decided, outside the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 and 29 July 2000, to do away with the requirement for residence permits for citizens of the three other countries residing in their territory.</p>
<p>2. In its Work Programme for 2000, the Commission declared its intention to present a proposal for a framework directive to replace the category-based approach to the subject of the rights derived from European citizenship. This directive is a reworking of several separate texts dealing with the various categories of person (workers, students, pensioners, etc.).</p>
<p> As this proposal has not yet been duly submitted by the Commission, the Council has clearly so far been unable to discuss it. It would therefore be premature at this stage to express any sort of assessment of it.</p>
<p> In any event, it can be noted that Article 45 of the draft Charter currently before the three institutions for their approval with a view to being formally proclaimed at Nice enshrines the right of every citizen, male or female, of the European Union “to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States”, and Article 45(2) stipulates that, “Freedom of movement and residence may be granted, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, to nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State.”</p>
<p>3.

<p>What initiatives has the French Council Presidency taken, or does it intend to take, vis-à-vis both the Member States and third countries with a view to accelerating the ratification process in the Member States which have not yet ratified the Statute and in the larger number of third countries so that the 60 ratifications required for the Court to begin its work may be secured at the earliest possible date?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Union considers it of the utmost importance to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is dedicated to ruling on the most serious of crimes and violations of humanitarian law. The entry into force of the Statute, which is subject to its ratification by the requisite number of 60 States, is a priority for the European Union. The Presidency recently stressed this priority when addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations on behalf of the European Union. It should be pointed out that the future and efficient operation of the ICC are subjects highlighted in the annual document stating the European Union’s priorities within the United Nations Organisation. Acknowledging that there is still a great deal of work to be done before ratification by the sixty countries is achieved, the Presidency was, nonetheless, able to observe a degree of progress given that, by the end of September, 113 States had signed the Rome Statute, and these included 21 States which had already completed the ratification process.</p>
<p>The Presidency regularly includes the subject of the International Criminal Court on the agenda of the meetings of the Council working party on public international law. These meetings are an opportunity for consultation between Member States on substantive issues and for assessing the progress made in signing and ratifying the Statute. At the last meeting, on 14 September, the Presidency noted that four EU Members, Italy, France, Belgium and Luxembourg were now among the 21 States which had ratified the Statute. It was also possible to envisage significant progress in the near future, as eight other Member States declared that they were relatively confident about being able to ratify by the end of the year. The three remaining countries repeated their intention to ratify but stipulated that they still had procedural or constitutional problems to resolve.</p>
<p>It should, however, be pointed out that the promotion of matters related to the ICC cannot be limited to the albeit very important matters of signing and ratifying the Statute, for, as it showed at the June meeting of the UN Preparatory Commission for the International Criminal Court, the European Union has restated its commitment to the integrity of the ICC Statute, and has consequently refused to amend the Statute in order to satisfy the demands of some third countries to withdraw the requirement to hand nationals of states that are not party to the Statute over to the ICC. This is clearly a position which will be upheld at future meetings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0764"></a>

<p>I refer, in particular, to the conclusions of the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000 (“A democratic, cooperative FRY living in peace with its neighbours will be a welcome member of the European family of democratic nations.

<p>Since March 2000, Albania has been one of the countries in receipt of funds allocated under the European initiative in favour of human rights and democracy under the Stability Pact.

<p>The European Union supports the promotion and defence of human rights in all regions of the world. In its dialogue with third countries the European Union regularly raises these issues, including minority rights issues.

<p>According to the terms of Regulation (EC) No 574/99 of 12 March 1999 (determining the third countries whose nationals must have visas when crossing the external borders of EU Member States), nationals of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or FYROM, need a visa to cross the external borders of Member States. In its amended proposal for a Council Regulation establishing the list of third countries whose nationals are required to have visas and the list of those whose nationals are exempt from this obligation [<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0577">COM(2000)577</a> final of 21 September 2000], the Commission proposes maintaining the requirement for a visa for FYROM nationals.</p>
<p>In the directives for negotiation which the Council has given the Commission, the justice and home affairs section of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (for which negotiations are reaching their conclusion, with the agreement due to be signed at the Zagreb Summit of 24 November) provides for establishing sound cooperation between the Community and FYROM with regard to visas, border control, asylum, readmission, and combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The European Union and FYROM will be able to examine the possibility of simplifying and expediting visa procedures, in the context of the Stabilisation and Association Council. The decision to maintain or waive the requirement for visas with regard to FYROM, however, is not a matter for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations, or the joint bodies arising therefrom, but rather the European Union’s common policy on visas, which lies within the sole jurisdiction of the Council of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Stabilisation and Association Agreement will provide a sound framework to enable FYROM to step up its justice and home affairs policy, bringing it up to a level which will be enough to justify, when the time comes, a request to waive the obligation for visas, since the conditions for this have not yet been achieved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0772"></a>

<p>On 18 December 1996, the European Court of Human Rights recognised that Turkey had contravened the property right guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No 1 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. On 28 July 1998, the Court ruled that compensation of over 450 000 Cypriot pounds (5.2 MF) had to be paid to the plaintiff. The interim resolutions adopted by the Council of Europe on 6 October 1999 and 12 July 2000 noted that the ruling had not been complied with and urged the Turkish authorities to pay the required sum.</p>
<p>The Council deeply deplores the fact that Turkey has not yet fulfilled its obligations arising from the Court ruling. The Council expects Turkey, just like any other Member State within the Council of Europe, to comply with the rulings of the Court and, in this instance, to pay Mrs Loïzidou fair compensation. This is an issue that affects the credibility of the whole institution. The Council trusts that the Council of Europe will remind Turkey of its obligations as a member.</p>

<p>May I first of all express my delight at the final acquittal of Mr Alexander Nikitin, as pronounced on 13 September 2000 by the Russian Supreme Court.</p>
<p>This decision brings to a close the legal procedure instituted against the former captain of the Russian navy, which had dragged on for over four years.</p>
<p>Mr Nikitin was arrested in February 1996 on charges of high treason (espionage and betrayal of state secrets). He was accused of transmitting information on the risks of nuclear pollution of the Baltic caused by Russia’s northern fleet to a Norwegian environmental organisation.</p>
<p>The EU has kept a close watch on this case from the beginning, particularly at the examination stage. Throughout the trial it has expressed its concern over Mr Nikitin’s predicament (he was first arrested for ten months, then allowed conditional freedom pending his trial). The Russian authorities responsible were approached several times and asked to guarantee him a fair trial in accordance with the law. In addition, diplomats from the Member States and the Commission were present at the trial as observers.</p>
<p>Certainly, the mobilisation of the Union and of international opinion also contributed to the happy outcome of this case.</p>
<p>In more general terms, it can be said that President Putin and the Russian government are displaying a fresh commitment to reform, which the Union wishes to support. Particular attention will be paid to consolidating democracy, the rule of law and the public institutions, including the judicial apparatus; these are among the main priorities of the joint strategy for Russia and the French Presidency’s action plan for its implementation.</p>

<p>The worsening oil crisis is not only leading to several structural problems in the economies of EU countries, but is also endangering lives in the poorer sections of society in Member States. Various statistics reveal that very large numbers of elderly people die each year from the cold. For example, it is reported that in London over 26 000 people die each year from the cold. This applies to every country, since the shameful pensions many elderly people receive are not even adequate for their basic survival needs, let alone for heating. Small children are also doomed to die of cold when their families have been condemned to live in poverty by their countries’ policies.</p>

<p>The Council would remind the honourable Member that, given this new ‘oil crisis’, at the informal Ecofin Council at Versailles on 9 September, the Council asked OPEC to implement measures guaranteeing market supplies that were better suited to the worldwide economic situation. On this occasion, the Council urged the Commission to look into ways, along with the Member States, to increase the level of competition in the energy sector.</p>
<p>Moreover, at the Council meeting on 20 September 2000 (Transport), the Presidency adopted conclusions to the effect that the delegations “consider that the European Union, as a major customer, ‘should ask OPEC to introduce measures to supply the market in a manner better suited to consumer demand’” and “call on the Commission and the Member States to take further steps to facilitate appropriate action in support of energy saving and promotion of alternative fuels in the areas of research and innovation, using suitable economic and regulatory instruments.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, at an international level, the Council is advocating that the forum of the International Energy Agency be used to the full in order to ensure the best possible coordination of national policies.</p>
<p>If one focuses on the measures to be taken to benefit the most disadvantaged sectors of the population, the Commission intends to publish, in the context of completing the internal market, a communication on public service obligations within the energy sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has furthermore already published a communication on the European Union’s oil supply, stating in particular: “The increase in oil prices strongly affects those levels of the population which are on the threshold of poverty and so risk to be further excluded in economic and social terms. The Commission intends to facilitate the exchange of experience on the appropriate means of alleviating the effects of the oil price increase for those who are most dependent on it and to reduce the risk of social exclusion in line with the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit.”</p>
<p>At the most recent General Affairs Council, on 9 and 10 October, the Council heard Mr Prodi present the main thrust of this communication, and suggested that the informal European Council meeting in Biarritz should look into the main questions raised in this text. This was, in fact, done on 13 October.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0784"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member notes in his question, the Council has, via Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Directive 95/29/EC, instituted binding Community rules for the protection of animals during transport.</p>
<p>In application of this directive, the Council has also, via Regulation (EC) No 411/98, introduced additional rules concerning road vehicles used for the transport of animals for journeys exceeding eight hours.</p>
<p>Article 8 of Directive 91/628/EEC lays down rules which the Member States are expected to follow in monitoring compliance with the directive, concerning, in particular, animals being transported, at the place of departure and the place of destination, as well as the means of transport and the accompanying documents.</p>
<p>The same article obliges Member States to submit an annual report to the Commission on the inspections carried out over the previous year, their results and any follow-up action taken.</p>
<p>The same provisions apply, mutatis mutandis, to legal acts in application of the Directive (namely Regulation (EC) No 411/98).</p>
<p>In addition, Article 10 of Directive 91/628/EEC lays down the conditions under which the Commission may carry out inspections and checks in the Member States with a view to the uniform application of the measures decided by the Council.</p>
<p>Outside the sphere of the above legislation, the honourable Member will agree that it is not for the Council to interpret its own acts or to monitor their implementation by the Member States, since those functions are, under the Treaty, the responsibility of the Court of Justice and the Commission.</p>
<p>On 19 June 2000, the Agriculture Council discussed the subject referred to by the honourable Member. On that occasion, the Commission said that it would submit a report on the conditions of implementation of the ‘welfare in transport’ directive. The Member States are committed to applying the existing rules in intra-Community trade, and are acting to ensure that third countries exporting live animals to the EU observe our high animal welfare standards. They are supporting the efforts at achieving international regulation of this issue being made by the Council of Europe and the International Office of Epizootics.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last fifteen years or so, the Community institutions have adopted various measures aimed at the creation and adoption throughout the Community of rules and standards on road safety, to be applied to users, vehicles and infrastructures. In this connection, the Community institutions have consistently taken the problem of young drivers into account.</p>
<p>On the matter of road accident statistics, the Council draws attention to those annexed to the Commission communication of 11 April 1997 on the second action programme for road safety in the EU, relating to the period 1997-2001. These statistics reveal a high percentage of deaths among young people (both drivers and passengers), with no differentiation by gender emerging. Should the honourable Member wish to approach the Commission, which is responsible for the CARE database, he may obtain more recent and detailed statistics on fatal accidents, broken down by age, gender and Member State (where the accident occurred).</p>
<p>The Council believes that, as things stand, the majority of those involved in road accidents in the Community are young drivers (aged between 18 and 25), and that male drivers predominate in this group. This is partly explained by the fact that there are more male drivers overall. Nonetheless, the proportion of accidents involving women drivers is on the increase; this no doubt reflects an increasing proportion of women drivers in general.</p>
<p>In its resolution of 26 June 2000 on reinforcing road safety, based on the Commission communication of 28 March 2000, the Council called upon the Commission to follow a number of guidelines in the implementation of the second action programme, concerning both the legislative proposals which it intends to submit and the research and information actions which it proposes to promote.</p>
<p>The Council’s guidelines refer to road safety measures aimed at protecting all drivers and passengers irrespective of gender. Some of these measures are genuinely innovative but are still at the experimental stage. Time will show whether they are feasible and whether they will lead to a real reduction in the numbers of road accident victims.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0798"></a>

<p>The informal European Council held in Biarritz on 13-14 October 2000 adopted the text of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and forwarded it to Parliament, the Commission and the Council with a view to its being solemnly proclaimed at the Nice Summit.</p>
<p>Concerning the action to be taken on the European Charter for Small Enterprises, it should be recalled that the European Council held in Santa Maria da Feira on 19-20 June 2000 welcomed the adoption of the Charter and stressed the importance of SMEs for growth, competitiveness and employment in the Union. In accordance with this spirit, it called for the full implementation of the Charter to be part of a global package for business policy, to be prepared on the basis of the Commission’s working programme for enterprise policy 2000-2005 and the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship (2001-2005). It expressed the desire to see the first results of this work by the end of 2000.</p>
<p>Each Charter must be implemented in its specific field of application.</p>
<p>Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises the freedom to conduct a business, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0799"></a>

<p>The Council is fully aware of the importance and the seriousness of the problem of child welfare in Romania. Since 1990 the EU has devoted over EUR 100 m to assistance to Romania aimed at helping it improve conditions in this area. This year more than EUR 25 m was allocated. Following the Commission’s second periodic report on the progress made by Romania towards accession, the subject has been included on the list of short-term priorities linked to compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria and the accession partnership adopted by the Council in December 1999.</p>
<p>The Council is reminding the Romanian authorities on all appropriate occasions of the priority which it accords to this question. It did so, in particular, at the sixth meeting of the EU-Romania Association Council, held on 21 March 2000. It will certainly also do so at the meeting of the Association Committee to be held on 27 October 2000.</p>
<p>On these occasions the Council also notes, on behalf of the EU, the progress made by Romania. This progress has included the creation in November 1999 of a national agency for the protection of children’s rights and the preparation of a ‘government strategy for children's rights 2000-2003’. The principles involved mark a step in the right direction: removal of as many children as possible from institutions; further decentralisation via the transfer of control over orphanages to the provincial authorities; and measures to prevent abandonment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0801"></a>

<p>In its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2000 on the above communication, the Council took the view (paragraph 8) that priorities and objectives should be fixed in close cooperation with the Member States and the other actors concerned and called upon the Commission to submit detailed proposals at the earliest possible juncture.</p>
<p>This dossier, which is a matter of priority for the French Presidency, is currently being examined in detail by the Council’s services. A detailed report on it is expected to be presented to the Council at its meeting of 5 December 2000, the objective being to propose a list of priorities to the Commission, thus enabling it to assess the issues on which the Member States either wish to see harmonisation at Community level or, alternatively, wish to see coordination of measures only. This should also make it easier for the Community to fine-tune the action plan to be submitted to the Gothenburg European Council, as announced by the Commission in its communication on the Union’s oil supplies.</p>
<p>These priorities should also take account of the actions relating to the Community’s strategy on climate change.</p>
<p>Moreover, the honourable Member will certainly be aware that the specific programme for energy, the environment and development under the fifth framework programme for research and technological development includes a key action aimed at achieving an economic and efficient supply of energy for a competitive Europe, the objective being to equip Europe with energy supplies which are reliable, non-polluting, efficient, safe and economic.</p>
<p>The Council cannot, at present, anticipate what actions will be taken in future concerning the future framework programme and its contents; it was only very recently that the Commission submitted its communication to the Council and Parliament on the guidelines for the Union's actions in the field of research for 2000-2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0804"></a>

We are all hopeful that the talks may be concluded within a relatively short timescale, enabling our fishermen to resume their activities.</p>

<p>The long-raging civil war in Sudan has acquired an international dimension as the government and rebels have been joined by multinational companies and foreign governments with their sights firmly set on the rich oil deposits in the south of the country. Instead of contributing towards peace, US policy to date has helped sustain the violence and tension. During the Cold War, the USA supported the Sudanese Government, whereas following that period and owing to the rise of the Islamic movement, it supported the rebels who are concentrated in the south of the country. Recently, there have been signs from the USA of diplomatic moves towards a political settlement of the bloody hostilities surrounding the oil deposits, based on the model for peace tried in Sierra Leone, which is coupled with the embargo on diamonds from that country. Some circles in Washington have also come out in favour of such an initiative being taken in cooperation with the EU Member States.</p>
<p>In the light of the above situation, of the risk of armed conflict spreading on the continent of Africa and the ever-growing importance of oil for the Member States’ economies, will the Council say whether it is aware of Washington's endeavours in this respect and what measures it will take to bring about peace in Sudan and a definitive end to the civil war?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concern as to the long-term nature of the armed conflict in Sudan. The breaking of the cease-fire in June 2000 and the resumption of hostilities threaten the humanitarian situation and the process of mediation undertaken by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). In a Presidency statement of 18 August, the European Union deplored the offensive launched by the SPLA and expressed its extreme concern at the bombing of civilian facilities by Sudanese aircraft. The European Union is continuing to support the mediation efforts made by IGAD. In addition, it is pressuring the Sudanese Government, particularly in the context of the renewed dialogue, as well as the other parties involved in the conflict, to adopt the path to a peaceful settlement of the country’s problems. The European Union considers that the parties should, as soon as possible, declare a total, unlimited cease-fire, to be effectively monitored. The Council considers that securing such a cease-fire must be one of the prime objectives of the negotiations as carried out in Nairobi under the auspices of the IGAD, alongside the implementation of an adequate monitoring system which would make any cease-fire agreed fully effective, and in order to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>The international community has never recognised Indonesia’s sovereignty over East Timor. UN Security Council Resolution No 384 of 22 December 1975 duly called for the territorial integrity of East Timor and the entitlement of its people to self-determination to be respected.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Security Council has always considered that the Republic of Cyprus exercised due sovereignty over the entire island, and therefore called, in its Resolution No 367 of 12 March 1975, for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus to be respected. On 18 November 1983, Security Council Resolution No 541 deplored “the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus”.</p>
<p>All States, with the exception of Turkey, have complied with this latter resolution and have refused to recognise the self-proclaimed ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’. When Resolution No 1283 was adopted on 15 December 1999, the Security Council reaffirmed its position that “a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship ... and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession.”</p>

<p>The honourable Member asks about the possibility of reinstating a budget line from which financial aid could be paid to Member States in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p>The Council would point out that the Commission did not propose reinstating this budget line it its preliminary draft budget for the year 2001. Nonetheless, at the request of a number of delegations that presented a statement in favour of restoring a budget line intended to provide emergency aid to populations in the European Union that have been hit by disasters, the Council looked into this matter during the Budget Council of 20 July 2000, but at that stage did not adopt the solution of restoring this line.</p>
<p>At second reading, the Council will certainly devote the utmost attention to looking into any amendments on this subject adopted by the European Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0816"></a>

<p>The Commission has submitted a proposal to the current Intergovernmental Conference on the introduction of a European Prosecutor. The proposal is based on an addendum to Article 280 of the Treaties and proposes that the European Public Prosecutor shall be responsible for ‘detecting, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of offences prejudicial to the Community’s financial interests and their accomplices and for exercising the functions of prosecutor in the national courts of the Member States’. The proposal does not specify any further practical details, e.g. what powers the Prosecutor should have or exactly which crimes he/she is to combat. These matters are to be decided at a subsequent juncture and under a different legislative procedure which only requires a qualified majority and not unanimity in the Council. What is the Council's view of the proposal? What is the Council’s view of the fact that a Member State may thus lose its right to determine the laws which apply within its borders?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In response to the honourable Member, I can only repeat the answer I have already given Mr Duff, to wit, that in accordance with Article 48 (ex Article N) of the Treaty on European Union, it is not the Council’s job to express an opinion on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. Under the same Treaty Article, it is the task of those participating in the Intergovernmental Conference, i.e. the representatives of the Member State governments, to adopt amendments to the Treaties by joint agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
