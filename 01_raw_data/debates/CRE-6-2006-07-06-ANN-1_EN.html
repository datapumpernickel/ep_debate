<p>(FI) The United States is an especially important partner for the EU. The transatlantic dialogue being very close, EU-US cooperation has led to concrete results in many fields. The transatlantic relationship is not restricted only to bilateral issues, but cooperation seeks to respond to different global challenges. The goal of the Finnish Presidency is to increase practical cooperation even further, and to deepen the strategic dialogue between the EU and the United States.</p>
<p>The transatlantic agenda of the Finnish Presidency is based to a large degree on the outcome of the EU-US Summit in Vienna on 21 June 2006. In Vienna the EU and the United States signed a common declaration, which consists of four separate entities:</p>
<p>promoting peace, human rights and democracy all over the world,</p>
<p>responding to global challenges, including security,</p>
<p>promoting prosperity and opportunities,</p>
<p>promoting strategic cooperation on energy and energy security, climate change and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The implementation of this declaration adopted in Vienna offers a basis for developing the EU-US relationship during the Finnish Presidency. The priorities in the EU-US relationship will be especially:</p>
<p>climate policy,</p>
<p>implementation of the economic initiative,</p>
<p>promoting democracy and stability, conflict settlement and supporting good governance especially in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Regarding climate policy, the Vienna Summit took a major step forward. In the declaration the EU and the US committed themselves to thinking about the possibilities for fighting climate change. Moreover, the EU and the United States agreed to meet in Helsinki this autumn and start a high-level dialogue on climate, clean energy and sustainable energy. On the basis of this mandate from the summit, a troika meeting at ministerial level in Helsinki is being planned.</p>
<p>In the sphere of economic cooperation one of the tangible results of the summit was the common working programme on intellectual property rights (IPR). Regulatory cooperation, which is so essential to economic partnership, has also moved forward in the last year. The declaration mentioned also that there will be an unofficial meeting of the Finance Mnisters during the Finnish Presidency. The issues on the agenda for the Finance Ministers’ meeting might be, for example, regulatory cooperation, innovations, competitiveness and energy. Another issue on the agenda will be the progress of the implementation of the EU-US economic initiative.</p>
<p>An efficient transatlantic partnership makes it possible to have a successful dialogue on subjects where different views initially seem to be far apart. The Finnish Presidency will continue to maintain the dialogue with the United States on all questions on the transatlantic agenda. Cooperation will continue to expand. In addition to the climate dialogue, one of the important outcomes of the Vienna summit was that EU-US energy cooperation has been raised to strategic level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0531"></a>

<p>(FI) On 5 May 2006 the Council adopted a common position concerning a proposal for a Council regulation laying down common rules for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, and the Cohesion Fund. Parliament has not yet given its assent to the proposal. The regulation fleshes out the December 2005 European Council conclusions to the effect that EUR 200 m in all is to be granted to the Peace programme in the period from 2007 to 2013. Under the regulation the programme is to be implemented as a cross-border programme aimed at promoting social and economic stability, in particular through measures to bolster solidarity across community divides. The region eligible for support comprises the whole of Northern Ireland and the Irish border areas. As provided for in the proposed ERDF regulation, the programme is to be implemented as part of the European regional cooperation objective and will observe the additionality principle governing Structural Fund assistance. The allocation of funding and the substance of the programme will be determined by Ireland and the United Kingdom, which will draw up a joint proposal for the Peace programme for the years 2007 to 2013. The Commission will approve the programme proposal before the start of the programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0533"></a>

<p>(FI) The Council is keeping the situation in the Balkans under permanent review.</p>
<p>In the wake of the independence referendum the Council adopted conclusions concerning Montenegro at its meeting of 12 June 2006. It drew attention to the fact that the Montenegrin Parliament had declared Montenegro an independent state and the Serbian Parliament had declared Serbia to be the succession state of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>In the conclusions the EU and its Member States decided to ‘develop further their relations with the Republic of Montenegro as a sovereign, independent State, taking full account of the referendum result and the aforementioned Parliamentary Acts. Member States will take the subsequent measures implementing this decision nationally in accordance with international law and practice’. After the declaration was issued, several Member States recognised Montenegrin independence and sovereignty bilaterally and indicated their intention of establishing diplomatic relations with Montenegro. Other Member States are likewise preparing to follow suit.</p>
<p>In the conclusions the EU also called on Serbia and Montenegro ‘to pursue a direct and constructive dialogue on their future relations’. The dialogue between the two countries has got off to an encouraging start.</p>
<p>The EU gave an overview of the region in a declaration adopted at the European Council meeting of 15 and 16 June 2006. The Thessaloniki action plan still forms the basis of EU policy towards the Western Balkans. The European Council also summarised the matters on which attention will need to be brought to bear in the future with a view to finding solutions. Negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia will resume immediately once Serbia has begun to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The EU will continue its support for the ongoing talks on the future status of Kosovo and is willing to intensify its role once the region’s status has been determined (the priority at this stage is the plans for a possible future EU operation related to the rule of law). It intends to develop its relations with the independent Montenegro both at EU level and as regards each Member State separately. Bosnia and Herzegovina has to continue the necessary reforms and prove equal to taking difficult decisions, for instance in the sphere of constitutional reform. Now that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed, Albania needs to press ahead with reforms. Establishing a free trade area is essential for the region. The negotiation on visa facilitation and readmission agreements will do much to consolidate relations with the EU. The EU will continue to back its policies for the Western Balkans by economic means. The new Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) is to be introduced next year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0535"></a>

<p>(FI) The Sudanese Government and one of the groupings in the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) signed the Darfur peace agreement on 5 May. Another main element in the SLM/A and a second major Darfur rebel movement, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), are still refusing to sign the agreement. Numerous representatives of those two factions have, however, indicated their support for the peace agreement. On 8 June, on the initiative of the African Union, they signed a declaration committing them to the agreement.</p>
<p>Since the peace agreement was signed the security situation in Darfur has reportedly been fairly calm and better than at any time in recent months, but remains extremely sensitive and volatile.</p>
<p>The EU has given its blessing to the peace agreement, which it regards as a precondition for lasting peace and security in Darfur. The Union has urged all sides to implement the agreement rapidly and in full. It has expressed its willingness to support implementation of the Darfur peace agreement and promote reconstruction and reconciliation in Darfur. The Council is planning the following measures to assist implementation of the agreement:</p>
<p>through the Special Representative, the EU will continue to support efforts to persuade those insurgents who have not yet signed to commit themselves to the agreement.</p>
<p>The EU is willing to undertake the tasks assigned to it under the Darfur peace agreement, first and foremost the vice-chairmanship of the ceasefire committee and of the committee preparing for dialogue and negotiations between the different parties involved in the Darfur crisis.</p>
<p>The EU has likewise stated its willingness to participate in the reconstruction and development of Darfur.</p>
<p>The EU will also continue to support the African Union operation (AMIS) in Darfur by providing further assistance (as regards funding, logistics, planning, and equipment) until such time as the mandate for the operation has come to an end. It has allocated EUR 50 m in special funding for AMIS under the African Peace Facility, bringing the total amount granted through that channel to EUR 212 m. At present the EU, in cooperation with the AU, is seeking to determine the areas in which it could provide additional military and/or police support for AMIS, bearing in mind the new tasks assigned to AMIS under the Darfur peace agreement and to enable the AMIS operation to be transferred to UN control under more favourable conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0570"></a>

<p>(FI) At its last meeting of 15-16 June 2006, the European Council confirmed that it was making efforts to find a political solution to the problems of Iran’s nuclear programme, one which takes into account the causes for concern expressed internationally with regard to the programme but which at the same time confirms Iran’s right to peaceful use of nuclear energy in accordance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</p>
<p>The Council is urging Iran to respond promptly and positively to the Community initiative on the Iranian nuclear programme, which the EU High Representative and the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Russia and the United States (the so-called EU3+3 group) presented to Iran. In addition, Iran must establish favourable preconditions for commencing talks on cooperation and entering into full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p>With regard to human rights, the Council has frequently stated that it is concerned about discrimination against religious and ethic minorities in Iran.</p>
<p>The Council is still very worried about the human rights situation in Iran, as Iran is not complying with universal principles or its own special obligations. In its session of 15 May, the Council expressed its concern about the increase in the number of executions, the arbitrary arrests, increasing restrictions on access to information and increasing violations of freedom of expression and religious freedom. It alluded in particular to the intimidation and harassment of defenders of human rights, lawyers and minority groups. The EU intends in future to raise issues of human rights, including the treatment of ethnic minorities, directly with Iran and in international bodies.</p>
<p>The Council also hopes that before long we will able to hold a new meeting within the framework of the dialogue on human rights between the EU and Iran, at which we can discuss the status of minorities in Iran, including the situation of the Ahwazis minority referred to in the question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0550"></a>

Similarly, Article IV-447 of the Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe states that the Treaty “shall be ratified by the High Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.” Each Member State, therefore, is to decide on the procedure for ratifying the Treaty on a constitution for Europe, including a possible referendum, in accordance with its constitution.</p>
<p>In addition, the Council would remind you that when the European Council met on 15 and 16 June point 43 of the Presidency’s conclusions stated that since June 2005 the Constitutional Treaty had been ratified by five Member States, totalling 15 that had now done so. Two Member States had not ratified the Treaty, and eight were yet to conclude the ratification process. One of these had recently initiated the ratification process. It was to be hoped that the process would be brought to completion in June 2005 in accordance with the conclusions reached. In ratifying the Treaty, each country functions as a Member State. The Finnish Government’s proposal regarding ratification of the Constitutional Treaty will not contain any reference to the Presidency that has just begun.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0554"></a>

<p>(FI) The key players in the Sri Lankan peace process are the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). At the request of both parties Norway has played a leading role since the 1990s as a mediator. The Union has supported Norway in its mediating role all the time and is still giving it its full backing.</p>
<p>Having jointly chaired the 2002 Tokyo Conference, the EU plays an important role in assisting the Norwegian mediation efforts and encouraging the two parties to agree to a ceasefire and start new peace talks. The travel ban imposed by the EU on the LTTE as a listed terrorist organisation applies to the reception of official LTTE delegations in EU countries. The ban does not prevent individual members of the LTTE or LTTE supporters from travelling to the EU area. However, persons in these categories – like anyone else – may be barred from entering if they fail to satisfy the normal entry or visa requirements. The ban likewise does not prevent dialogue with the LTTE. The Tamil National Alliance, for example, which officially represents Tamils from the North and North-East in the Sri Lankan Parliament, in practice represents the LTTE and its interests, but there are no obstacles to the official reception of TNA delegations in EU countries. A delegation of TNA Members of Parliament is now on a tour of European countries in an attempt to persuade the governments and parliaments of the Member States to exert pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to keep to its ceasefire promises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0557"></a>

<p>According to the European Social Survey, in which 22 Member States and their national statistical services took part, Europe seems to be undergoing a crisis of values and general direction. Europeans appear not to have confidence either in national political figures or the political and economic institutions of their country or those of the EU. The degree of confidence in the EU institutions is in inverse proportion to that in national institutions, i.e. if the citizens of a Member State are distrustful of their national parliamentary institutions, they show more confidence in Community institutions and vice-versa. Thus, in countries where the feeling of confidence in the national political institutions is high, such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, there is a lack of confidence in the European Parliament and the other EU institutions.</p>
<p>How is the Council addressing European citizens' lack of confidence in their national political institutions and the institutions of the EU? Might the above factors be one of the main reasons for the rejection of the constitutional treaty?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) At its meeting of 15 and 16 June 2006, the European Council once again examined the issue raised by the honourable Member, which concerns how committed our citizens are to the European Union.</p>
<p>Despite the concern expressed in public debates in the Member States, the European Council believes that the people are still committed to Europe’s common project.</p>
<p>The Commission’s special Eurobarometer on Europe’s future which came out in May shows that the European Union’s image is mainly a positive one. Above all, it is considered to be democratic, modern and protective. The public have also of course criticised the EU, believing it to be technocratic and somewhat ineffective.</p>
<p>To respond to criticism of this kind, the European Council is aiming at closer dialogue with the public and wants to achieve concrete results. The conclusion of the President of the European Council was that the public expected the Union to show it was bringing value added and to respond, through action, to the challenges of our time and the potential it offers: a guarantee of peace, affluence and solidarity, increased security, sustainable development and the speedy promotion of European values in a globalising environment.</p>
<p>The European Council considered that providing the public with first hand information on the work of the Union was a precondition for increased confidence in it on the part of its citizens. The European Union has agreed on several measures to try and make the Union’s work more effective by fully exploiting the current Treaties and the possibilities they offer and, in particular, to make the Council’s work more transparent.</p>
<p>In real terms, this means that, in general, all Council debates under the codecision procedure will be public from here on, which will make the European Parliament and the Council just as open when these institutions are working together as legislators.</p>
<p>The European Council also reminded everyone that if the value added brought by the European Union were conveyed more clearly in EU legislation, this could boost public confidence in Europe’s common project. It urged the Union’s institutions consistently to verify that there was due compliance with the principles and guidelines established in the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to add that the Union’s will, as expressed at the European Council, to become more democratic, transparent and effective is not just restricted to the EU’s present “period of reflection” regarding the future. Finland, as the current Presidency, will itself try to promote the implementation of these principles in practice in the work of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0559"></a>

<p>(FI) Respect for human rights is one of the aims of the EU’s external policy. The Council believes that it is very important to comply with the UN’s behavioural rules on the prevention of sexual exploitation. The UN has also come up with several initiatives with regard to this issue. Claims that UN personnel are guilty of sexual exploitation must be investigated thoroughly and, if necessary, they must lead to appropriate disciplinary action. It is no surprise that the serious allegations which the honourable Member mentions have caused much concern in the EU.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member says, the UN has behavioural rules on the prevention of sexual exploitation. These rules, which apply to all UN personnel, state that sexual exploitation is a serious crime, which may lead to disciplinary action, including immediate dismissal.</p>
<p>The UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), to which the honourable Member refers in particular, has the task of protecting people and promoting human rights in Liberia, especially with regard to vulnerable groups such as women and children. After NGOs had reported allegations that UNMIL personnel were guilty of sexual exploitation, the EU raised the matter with UN Special Representative Alan Doss, who said there would be a policy of zero tolerance in this and action to investigate the claims of sexual exploitation, in accordance with UN rules.</p>
<p>After that a report by UNMIL, dated 7 June 2006, was published, stating that so far disciplinary action had been taken in six cases investigated. Investigations will continue with regard to the other 18 cases reported in 2005 and 17 cases reported in 2006.</p>
<p>The Council trusts that UNMIL will continue its objective to end any kind of abuse, and the Council will be monitoring the situation continuously.</p>
<p>As for development aid for Liberia, the Council recently decided to recommence full development cooperation with that country. Consequently, Liberia will be receiving cash from the ninth European development fund until the end of 2007 and from the tenth European development fund thereafter. This decision is based on the very positive political developments that have taken place in the country since democratic elections were held and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf elected as president. She is working with great determination to secure a better future for her country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0574"></a>

Moreover, a few months ago, the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive to ensure that public authorities devoted a minimum share of their orders to purchase 'clean' public transport vehicles. At the same time, the development of innovative programmes to develop clean urban transport (CIVITAS, CUTE) continues.</p>
<p>Jacques Barrot, the Commissioner responsible for Transport, stated recently (on 15 June at the Salon Européen de la Mobilité) that he intend to propose that consultations be held with all members of the urban transport sector. Does the Council endorse this view and the Commissioner's view that a Green Paper should be drawn up on this subject? Does the Council intend to take initiatives in this area aimed at implementing policies in favour of promoting effective urban communications and transport?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) The main goal of EU transport policy is the production of passenger transport services which are safe, efficient and of good quality, taking account of social, regional and environmental factors. The aim is also to offer special tariffs to certain categories of passenger or all passengers and eliminate differentials in transport companies in different Member States that might distort competition. For this reason, the Council will fully back any initiatives that propose public platforms for any parties involved in urban transport systems, so that they may be closely involved in the definition and implementation of policy.</p>
<p>The Council has adopted several Commission proposals for promoting efficient intercity and urban transport using various modes of transportation. The most recent of these is even referred to in the honourable Member’s question. That is the political agreement reached by the Council on 9 June on the Commission’s proposed Regulation on rail and road public transport services, which aims to bring legislation that is partially obsolete up-to-date and open up the markets in these sectors in Europe. Research into the subject and the experience of countries where there has been competition in the public transport sector for many years now show that controlled competition between transport companies, accompanied by the appropriate protection mechanisms, leads to more attractive and innovative services and lower fares, without this preventing producers of public services from discharging the responsibilities that they have been entrusted with.</p>
<p>This approach was also adopted by the European Council on 28 March 2006 with reference to the so-called Lisbon Process, when the Commission, the Council and the Member States were asked to expedite, within the framework of their competences, the liberalisation of the Market in the transport sector, among others.</p>
<p>The Council has not yet begun the debate on the Commission Communication on sustainable transport (“Keep Europe moving – Sustainable mobility for our continent – Mid-term review of the European Commission's 2001 Transport White Paper”), and, for that reason, cannot comment on the proposals it contains. A political debate on the Communication is due to take place at the Transport Council in October.</p>
<p>The debate on the Commission proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive to promote clean road transport is only in the initial stages.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0579"></a>

<p>Energy security has always been one of the main economic and political problems of the EU. Energy dependency on Russian oil and gas has become a hot topic of discussion in the EU, especially this year, and the EU has clearly understood that in the coming decade energy supplies will play a much more evident political role than before. The lack of an effective EU energy policy towards Russia allows the Kremlin to play European companies and their governments off against each other for access to gas and investment opportunities. The Green Paper on energy is filled with recommendations, but no enforcement power on the vital issues of energy diversity. What is the Finnish Presidency's programme concerning the coordination of energy policy? Does the Finnish Presidency foresee the possibility of having an EU common energy policy in the near future? If so, what steps does the Presidency plan to make? Is the Finnish Presidency ready to contribute to the security of reciprocity and greater transparency of Russia's energy sector?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) For some time now the Council has been developing a more coordinated energy policy, drafting in stages a legislative package on energy which covers both the promotion of renewable energy sources and packages to liberalise successive markets, to ensure that common energy markets are completely opened up by July 2007.</p>
<p>The Council which convened in March 2006 submitted its conclusions to the European Council in the form of a document entitled “New Energy Policy for Europe”. The European Council dealt with this matter itself in its conclusions in March regarding an energy policy for Europe. It encouraged the development of a European energy policy that would strive for an effective Community policy, consistency of action by the Member States and coherent action in different areas of policy, and which would result, in a balanced way, in goals for reliability of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Reliability of supply should be improved by, for example, developing a common approach to external policy by taking the dialogue on energy between the EU and its main partners forward and though effective diversification of foreign and domestic energy sources, suppliers and transportation routes.</p>
<p>The recent decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on pan-European energy networks will be an important step towards the diversification of energy sources and transportation routes. The Energy Community Treaty established with the countries of South-east Europe will serve to promote achievement of this goal, because the internal market in energy approach will be extended to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>For examples of how these strategies for diversification are being strengthened, the Council would direct the honourable Member’s attention to the strategic partnership with Algeria that is being discussed at the moment, and the cooperation strategy on energy with countries on the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. These are now concrete responses to the European Council’s request to open up new gas supply routes, especially from the Caspian region and North Africa.</p>
<p>The European Council which convened in June 2006 has recently reconfirmed its approach to this common energy policy and consolidated its position, especially with regard to external considerations relating to reliability of energy supplies, with reference inter alia to a document jointly produced by the Commission and the Secretary-General of the Council/High Representative called “An External Policy to Serve Europe’s Energy Interests”. The Council, together with the Commission and the Secretary-General of the Council/High Representative, intends to find ways in the future of speaking with one voice on external energy matters and to make use of all the available instruments, including the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Security and Defence Policy, and EU trade policy.</p>
<p>Regarding Russia, the Council means to exploit existing structures and work together with the European Commission to enhance the dialogue on energy between the EU and Russia. This will also entail ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty and bring to a conclusion the talks on the Transit Protocol, as the European Council has requested. The legal framework that these instruments provide would make the energy markets more open, increase competition and would help create a favourable operational environment for investment in the countries included in the agreements. In addition, the Council intends to work with the Commission to establish a bilateral energy agreement when the successors to the Partnership and Cooperation are being discussed. In this connection, and in the relevant forums, such as the dialogue on energy between the EU and Russia, there could be discussion of issues relating to reciprocity and transparency. In fact, these key issues have already been raised recently in a letter, which Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and President of the EU Energy Council Martin Bartenstein sent to the Russian Energy Minister Viktor Khristenko. The Presidency also intends to resolve these issues with Russia at the Permanent Partnership Council on Energy and later at the EU-Russia Summit in November. External relations connected with energy, and especially those with Russia, will also be one of the topics at the informal meeting in October of the Heads of State or Government in Lahti. If we develop a common external energy policy with regard to Russia, there would be a real possibility of an energy partnership, which would be secure and predictable for both parties, and which would guarantee fair, reciprocal, open and non-discriminatory access to markets and the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that during the Finnish Presidency the Council intends to prepare the relevant input for the Commission for a strategic energy review, which the Commission will be presenting to the Council and the European Parliament in 2007, and which will discuss the targets and action required for an external energy policy, in particular, and what it considers to be adequate levels of diversification in the medium and long term.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0581"></a>

<p>(FI) The Council is at present discussing an EU theme-related strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment and, in particular, a directive on the framework for a Community marine environment policy. The directive will aim at protection of the marine environment, including that in the Baltic Sea region. The Baltic Sea is one of the key areas in which the Member States will need to implement their obligations under the directive.</p>
<p>We have to remember that the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) Stakeholder Conference, which triggered the debate, recently approved the initial measures to draft the Baltic Sea Action Plan to protect and revive the Baltic marine environment. The action plan entails cooperation between the governments of the countries with a Baltic Sea coastline: Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Russia and Estonia. The purpose of the Baltic Sea Action Plan is to implement the EU’s marine strategy in the Baltic Sea with the cooperation of all the countries that have a Baltic coastline. The plan will adhere to the ecosystem-based operational model in attending to the needs of the Baltic Sea. It defines what a good environmental state would constitute for the Baltic Sea and reconfirms environmental objectives and measures that need to be taken. It will thus promote the successful implementation of the EU’s marine strategy in the region. The HELCOM Ministerial Meeting in autumn 2007 intends to adopt the Baltic Sea Action Plan.</p>
<p>The Commission has put forward a proposal on the ‘Third Maritime Safety Package’, which contains six proposals for directives and one proposal for a Regulation. The Council is right now discussing two proposals for directives. Being debated are an amendment to the Directive on port state control and an amendment to the Directive on traffic monitoring.

<p>(EN) 2006 is the fourth year the Commission is providing financial resources to the reconstruction of Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein. At the Madrid Conference, the EC pledged €200 million launching the international reconstruction effort to assist Iraq. In the meantime, a total amount of €718,5 million will have been allocated from the European budget to Iraq by the end of this year.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<p>In 2003, €100 million coming from ECHO plus €42 million funded from the budget for Iraq reconstruction,</p>
<p>In 2004, a total of €176.5 million,</p>
<p>In 2005, €200 million were allocated to Iraq,</p>
<p>And finally €200 million in 2006 of which €120 will be committed in the next few days.</p>
<p>In accordance with the World Bank's and the United Nations' needs assessment of August 2003 and, the Iraqi National Development Strategy, EU support has been concentrated on basic needs. Almost 50% of EU aid has been in support of developing basic services (education, health, water and sanitation). A further 25% has been devoted to income generating activities for the poor.</p>
<p>75% of allocated money went thus to activities alleviating the daily difficulties of the Iraqi population. The rest went to support the United Nations in its activities to promote democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>Although all funds allocated so far have been committed, contracted and largely disbursed, today, as in previous years, implementation depends heavily on 1) the political stability and, 2) the complicated security situation which seriously hampers the promotion of peace in the country.</p>
<p>The Commission remains committed to continue supporting Iraq’s political and economic reconstruction in the years to come. To that end it has put forward a new Communication for a renewed EU engagement with Iraq; it is in the process of launching the negotiations of contractual relations; and will continue devoting financial resources for reconstruction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0543"></a>

They are fleeing systematic attacks by both Government of Sri Lankan forces and the LTTE, as well as paramilitary and proxy forces on both sides.

<p>(EN) The promotion of human rights is an essential element of the bilateral agreements signed between the European Union and third countries. Human rights protection and promotion are institutionalized in the so-called “human rights and democracy clause” which constitutes a fundamental element of the EU-Mexico Association Agreement.</p>
<p>In the framework of EU-Mexico partnership, the Commission has developed an intense dialogue on human rights issues, in line and in coordination to what is done by other European Institutions and mainly by the Parliament. In the context of this dialogue, the Mexican authorities keep us regularly informed of their progress toward a more intense promotion of human rights and rule of law in Mexico, as well as of all difficulties and shortcomings such promotion occasionally meets.</p>
<p>The Commission supports Mexico efforts toward a more effective protection of human rights, internally and externally through cooperation programmes specifically targeted at helping Mexico in facing present challenges in the field.</p>
<p>Its approach has produced good results. Mexico has become a signatory and active supporter of all main international initiatives and conventions aimed at the promotion of human rights. The new role internationally played by Mexico in human rights promotion has been acknowledged by the international community and has lead to the appointment of Mexico at the Presidency of the newly created Human Rights Council of the United Nations. Having said that, the Commission has to notice that the battle has not yet been won, especially at state and local levels.</p>
<p>The sad facts of Atenco, the offences to human rights and dignity reported by some of the protesters indicate, as promptly admitted by the Mexican Government itself, that the professionalism and training of police forces still remain an open challenge for Mexico. The context in Atenco was a hard one. Some policemen were taken hostages; there was a situation of civil unrest. However, nothing justifies the humiliating treatment reserved to the detained persons and to the women in particular.</p>
<p>The Mexican Government has informed the Commission in writing about the incidents and since then it has maintained a dialogue with the Mexican authorities about the issues in Atenco and about other cases where human rights were not adequately protected in Mexico. The Commission has also obtained information from the civil society and from concerned non governmental organizations whose contributions have helped it in obtaining a wider understanding of the facts and have allowed it to consider them from different angles.</p>
<p>Administrative and judicial investigations are on-going in Mexico. Some policemen were fired, others were suspended, 23 of them received an arrest warrant and will have to face a trial. There was a healthy reaction by the Mexican society and State. In the context of its political dialogue with Mexico, the Commission will continue to follow the case of Atenco as well as all other cases where human rights are at stake.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0556"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU will strive to implement the objectives of the Human Rights Council to ensure as far as possible that it is an improvement on the Commission on Human Rights. In the longer term, this will include trying to establish a new culture of, and approach to, human rights in the United Nations (UN). This means that apart from political declarations more emphasis will be put on greater cooperation, understanding and technical assistance. In the shorter term, this will involve working hard to ensure that the review of the mandates, mechanisms and functions transferred from the Commission on Human Rights in the first year of the Council’s existence do actually lead to practical improvements. None of these will be easy tasks, and much will depend on the commitment of the newly elected members of the Council, but the EU is determined to work to this end.</p>
<p>There is no formal programme of cooperation between the EU and the Council, nor does the resolution establishing the Council foresee such formal cooperation with other intergovernmental organisations. The EU Member States elected to the Council will, however, promote good cooperation between the Council and the EU as part of their functions as members of the Council.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission, which has formal observer status in the Council, will be closely associated with the work of the Council. Where appropriate and possible, its human rights policy and funding priorities will reflect the priorities of the Council.

<p>(FR) There is currently no European Union legislation intended to help parents in prison or relating to the specific problem of the conditions of detention for women with young children. There is currently no intention to draw up any such legislation.</p>
<p>This is because, in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, actions aimed at harmonising national rules can only be taken if they are necessary in order to improve cooperation amongst the Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission takes an interest in conditions of detention in general and takes part in various working groups on this subject within the Council of Europe. In particular, the Commission takes part in the work of the group of experts responsible for updating the recommendation of European prison rules, which deals indirectly with this issue. This is the case in particular with Rule 36, which deals with the issue of whether young children should be authorised to stay in prison with one of their parents, and if so, for how long. Ideally, parents of young children should not be imprisoned, something that is not always possible. The solution adopted here is to stress that the decision must be taken according to the interests of the young child. Nevertheless, the parental authority of the mother, if it has not been withdrawn, must be recognised, just like that of the father. It must be stressed that, when young children are kept in prisons, they must not be classed as prisoners. They must preserve all the rights of young children living freely in society. The Rule does not define any upper limit in terms of the age from which a young children must be separated from their detained parent. There are very significant cultural differences in this regard.

<p>(EN) In its Communication Fighting trafficking in human beings - an integrated approach and proposals for an action plan of 18 October 2005<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission stressed the need for an integrated approach to combat trafficking in human beings, taking into account the global nature of the crime and calling for a coordinated policy response that includes the areas of external relations and development cooperation.</p>
<p>Against this background programmes such as TACIS (for Eastern Europe and Central Asia), CARDS (for South-East Europe), AENEAS (focusing on asylum and migration projects in third countries) and EIDHR (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights) can be and are used to financially support projects to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings. Such projects include the protection of and assistance for victims, the strengthening of relevant law enforcement authorities, the support for capacity-building in the field of drafting, implementing and ensuring the effectiveness of national legislation and management systems as regards the fight against criminal activities as well as prevention of trafficking in human beings through awareness raising campaigns and labour market based measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, organisations from Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro may participate in projects supported under the Community action programme on measures providing Community-wide support to Member States' action relating to violence against children, young persons and women (DAPHNE II) as associate partners. However, in order for organisations from these countries to be eligible for EC funding under a Daphne project, these countries must have entered into specific agreements with the Commission regarding financial participation in the Programme. None of these countries has entered into such an agreement. Therefore, for the time being in the framework of DAPHNE II only participation without EC funding is allowed for organisations from these countries.</p>
<p>In addition, anti trafficking projects that are financially supported under the AGIS<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> programme, although the latter focuses on cooperation within the Union, often involve third countries neighbouring the European Union, in particular from Eastern and Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission, in its recently adopted Communication on the Roadmap for equality between women and men, for the period 2006-2010, reiterated its commitment for the elimination of trafficking in human beings, as outlined in the EU Action on Trafficking in Human Beings, and for the promotion of the use of all existing instruments, including the European Social Fund, for the reintegration of victims.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

When comparing the current situation with the response given to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-4029_EN.html">E-4029/05</a>, also posed by the Honourable Member, the good news is that now also Austria, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden have completed their ratification procedures for the three Protocols.</p>
<p>The issue of ratification of the three Protocols has also been discussed at numerous occasions within the Council structures, and at those occasions the Member States which have not yet formally notified ratification of the three Protocols all indicated that they expect their ratification procedures to be finalised before the end of 2006.</p>

<p>(EN) The deadline for transposition by Member States of Directive 2003/86 on the right to family reunification expired on 3 October 2005. That means that by this date the law of all respective Member States should reflect the provisions of the Directive. There are 22 Member States which are bound by the Directive i.e. all except Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In spite of the clear legal obligation in Article 20 of the Directive, at present only 12 Member States have communicated measures fully transposing the Directive. In this situation the Commission has taken the standard procedural steps as required by the Treaty. In December 2005 letters of formal notice asking Member States to provide their transposition measures were sent by the Commission.</p>
<p>Those ten Member States which persist in this violation of the Directive will soon receive reasoned opinions urging them to communicate within 2 months the measures transposing the Directive. Should they fail to do so the Commission will consider launching cases before the European Court of Justice against all these Member States.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to stress that the Directive has been applicable for a relatively short time. For this reason, it would be premature to present a comparative analysis of the ways in which Member States have implemented the Directive, notwithstanding the non communication of transposition measures. This exercise requires an in-depth examination of both the measures adopted by the Member States and the practice of their authorities in the application of the Directive.</p>
<p>Article 19 of the Directive obliges the Commission to prepare a report on the application of this act in the Member States by October 2007. The report will be presented to the Parliament as well as to the Council. This document will provide all necessary data to assess the level and appropriateness of measures used to transpose the Directive by all the Member States concerned. The report will also contain information on the issues raised in the question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 2004/38/EC<a href="#defann_34_2" name="refann_34_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, applies to Union citizens who are beneficiaries of the Directive, have been convicted of a criminal offence in a host Member State and have served their full sentence.</p>
<p>In particular, Article 33 of Directive 2004/38/EC provides that expulsion orders may not be issued by the host Member State as a penalty or legal consequence of a custodial penalty, unless they conform to the requirements laid down in the Directive. This Article also provides that if an expulsion order is enforced more than two years after it was issued, the Member State shall check that the individual concerned is currently and genuinely a threat to public policy or public security and shall assess whether there has been any material change in the circumstances since the expulsion order was issued.</p>
<p>Member States may not derogate from any provision of the Directive.</p>
<p>Under Article 28.3 of Directive 2004/38/EC, an expulsion decision may not be taken against a Union citizen except if the decision is based on imperative grounds of public security if they have resided in the host Member State for the previous ten years or if they are a minor, except if the expulsion is necessary for the best interests of the child as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the child of 20 November 1989.</p>
<p>As noted by the Court of Justice in its decision of 17 February 2005 in case C-215/03, Oulane, a detention order can only be based on an express derogating provision, such as Article 8 of Directive 73/148 (now replaced by Article 27 of Directive 2004/38/3C), which allows Member States to place restrictions on the right of residence of nationals of other Member States in so far as such restrictions are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</p>
<p>In the case of Union citizens who benefit from the increased protection against expulsion afforded by Article 28.3 of Directive 2004/38/EC, a measure of detention in view their expulsion must therefore necessarily be based on imperative grounds of public security and respect the material and procedural guarantees laid down in this Directive and in particular those foreseen under Article 33 concerning expulsion as a penalty or legal consequence of a custodial penalty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is indeed following a twin-track approach, on the basis of advice received, amongst others, from the Parliament and the Article 29 Working Party.</p>
<p>In the short term, its Recommendation to the Council deals with the current situation, i.e. proposing a solution to the Council for the period covered by the actual agreement (November 2007).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining how to maintain the content of the current Passenger Name Records (PNR) package into a new agreement which provides for the same level of data protection and legal security, including a reference to the US CBP Undertakings.</p>
<p>The Recommendation is not the appropriate place to make a reference to possible solutions as it should only be concerned with what we want to achieve in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This does not preclude starting to reflect already on possible ways ahead in the medium term, as it is the Commission's intention to limit the duration of the soon to be negotiated agreement until the end of November 2007. The use of Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union should be amongst the options to consider, but the time needed for any such decision to enter into force needs to be kept in mind, in view in particular of the need to respect national constitutional requirements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0588"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on 30 May 2006 that the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to the United States (US) - Customs and Border Protection Agency dealing with the protection of public security and the public activities in criminal law matters is excluded from the scope of the Data protection Directive 95/46/EC.</p>
<p>For that sole reason, the Court has annulled the Commission Decision on adequacy regarding the transfer of PNR data to the US and, for the same reason, the Council Decision authorising the conclusion of an international agreement with the US, which could not be adopted under Article 95 EC.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission does not share the point of view of the Honourable Member that the Agreement is a flagrant violation of fundamental democratic rights. To the contrary, the Commission, like the Advocate General of the Court, considers it fully in line with the principles applying to the protection of personal data and fundamental rights. In fact, the Court did not address in its judgement the content of the Commission Decision or the Agreement, which latter remains in force until it is denounced with ninety days’ notice. The Court therefore left the Commission decision in force until 30 September 2006 in order to allow the necessary time for its ruling to be implemented.</p>
<p>To respect this ruling and to comply with it within the given time-frame, the Council adopted on 27 June 2006 two initiatives, as recommended by the Commission on 16 June 2006:</p>
<p>to denounce the current International Agreement with the US in accordance with the provisions of Article 233 of the EC Treaty, and</p>
<p>an authorisation to open negotiations for an Agreement on the basis of articles 24 and 38 EU.</p>
<p>The aim of the Recommendation is to comply with the Ruling of the ECJ regarding the correct legal basis for the International Agreement, as the Court ruled that the access to data of law enforcement authorities in the framework of the protection of public security and public activities in criminal law matters falls outside the scope of the Directive and Article 95 EC.</p>
<p>Article 38 of TEU is the correct reference to conclude an International Agreement with this content. Article 38 refers to the procedure provided for in Article 24 EU. Consequently the Commission recommended the Council to authorise its Presidency, assisted by the Commission, to open negotiations to conclude an Agreement with the US on the use of PNR data.</p>
<p>The negotiating directives aim at the conclusion of an agreement having the same content as the measures annulled by the Court and offering the same level of safeguards regarding the legal certainty for the air carriers, the respect of Human Rights, notably the respect of privacy, and the purposes for which these PNR may be used.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any similar agreements with the US.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0582"></a>

<p>On 2 and 3 June general elections were held in the Czech Republic in an intensely anti-communist climate which began with government attempts to outlaw the Communist Youth Association of the Czech Republic and continued with the beating-up of Jiří Doleyš, the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (the Czech Republic) and a Communist Member of Parliament. In addition, T shirts with aggressive slogans, such as 'Kill a Communist - Help Peace' were produced with the support of the Foreign Ministry itself, and there was also a campaign by 'independents' calling on Czechs to steal and destroy the ballot cards of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia which were sent by mail to voters and offering deductions on various goods for people who could show they had not voted for the Communist Party.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission attaches the greatest of importance to the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the rule of law.

<p>The right to vote is a fundamental political right. The universality, equality, freedom and secrecy of voting are principles enshrined in the constitutional traditions of the Member States.</p>
<p>However, with regard to the field of electoral rights, the European Union only has competence in relation to certain aspects of municipal elections and European elections insofar as the Community legislation, on the one hand, guarantees Union citizens the right to take part in these elections in the Member State of residence and, on the other, establishes the general framework for the European elections.</p>

<p>(FR) The European Year 2007 on Equal Opportunities for All aims to promote diversity and combat discrimination on the basis of sex, age, disability, sexual orientation and religion and belief under Article 13 of the EC Treaty. It does not directly deal with issues linked to cross-border mobility of EU citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the challenges faced by EU citizens when moving to another Member State. Therefore, the Commission proposed to designate 2006 as European Year of Workers' Mobility to tackle the issues raised by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Year are threefold:</p>
<p>Raising the awareness of EU citizens on the rights, opportunities and instruments in the area of geographic and job-to-job mobility;</p>
<p>identifying new means to improve the environment of migrant workers;</p>
<p>removing remaining obstacles to mobility.</p>
<p>Workers' mobility is identified in the revised Lisbon Strategy on Growth and Jobs as well as in the European Employment Strategy as an essential instrument to create employment and contribute to the creation of a genuine labour market in Europe. Furthermore, the EURES portal provides all EU citizens with direct access to all job vacancies published by the public employment services, i.e. around 1 million jobs at any given time. It also contains information on living and working conditions in the EU. EURES also comprises a network of over 750 advisors who provide assistance to workers and their families in matters relating to cross-border job mobility.</p>
<p>As a guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is fully committed to ensuring that rights granted by the Treaty or secondary legislation to EU citizens concerning free movement and equal treatment are complied with by Member States and public authorities at national, regional and local level.</p>
<p>In its fourth report on citizenship of the Union, the Commission referred to the recurrent petitions it receives concerning the fact that Union citizens residing in a Member State that is not their country of origin do not have the right to vote or stand in national elections in the Member State in which they reside (with the exception of Irish nationals residing in the United Kingdom and vice versa).</p>
<p>The Commission admits that this situation is unsatisfactory, as it means that Union citizens may find themselves deprived of some of their political rights if they make use of their freedom of movement.</p>
<p>It also stresses that any future decision on measures to be taken to widen the range of rights conferred upon Union citizens should be subject to careful reflection, taking into account the decision-making process set out in Article 22 in Part 2 of the EC Treaty, which deals with citizenship, as well as the specific nature of and the differing sensibilities on this subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0566"></a>

<p>(FR) As stated in the Communication from the Commission “Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006”<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Community policy on health and safety at work must keep pace with new needs, in order to promote 'well-being at work'.</p>
<p>Well-being at work means physical, moral and social well-being and therefore goes beyond protection against accidents and occupational diseases. Emerging illnesses such as stress, depression, anxiety, violence at work, harassment and intimidation, which account for 18% of all problems related to health at work, are linked to a wide range of possible factors (such as work organisation, working time arrangements, hierarchical relations, transport-related fatigue) as opposed to exposure to a particular risk.</p>
<p>These principles were built into Framework Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work. This Directive contains general principles on prevention of occupational risks, protection of safety and health, elimination of risk and accident factors, information, consultation and training of workers and their representatives according to national laws and/or practices.</p>
<p>In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the Framework Directive is also clear regarding responsibilities. The well-being of workers is clearly a responsibility of all stakeholders concerned (Member States, employers and workers), albeit at different levels. For example, Recital 8 of the Directive states that Member States have a responsibility to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers on their territory as measures shall be introduced in accordance with national law and/or practices.</p>
<p>As to reporting obligations and monitoring progress, the Framework Directive provides that national authorities report to the Commission on the practical implementation of the Directive, after consultation of the social partners. The Commission then informs Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work, and periodically submits a report on the implementation of the Directive to Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p>There are two aspects, work-related stress and violence in the workplace, which may influence the psychological well-being of workers.</p>
<p>On the first one, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that a Framework Agreement was signed on 8 October 2004 between the European social partners<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As regards the second aspect, it is important to note that, in its communication 'Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006', the Commission announced that it would 'examine the appropriateness and the scope of a Community instrument on psychological harassment and violence at work'.</p>
<p>On 23 December 2004, the Commission adopted the document concerning the first stage of the consultation of the social partners on violence at work, pursuant to Article 138(2) of the Treaty, taking account of the fact that the social partners had included the subject of harassment in their joint programme of work for 2003-2005. The social partners have decided to initiate discussions with a view to negotiating a voluntary agreement on this subject. The discussions began in February 2006, and are expected to continue until the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The importance of work-related aspects of mental wellbeing was also emphasised in the Commission’s Green Paper 'Improving the mental health of the population. Towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union'<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the subsequent consultation meetings. The consultation on this Green Paper ended on 31 May 2006. The Commission is now analysing the contribution</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In Poland there are some 5.5 million disabled persons, including 202 000 children. One disabled child in three lives in rural areas, where access to medical care, rehabilitation treatment and educational services is difficult.</p>
<p>The great majority of disabled persons (84%) live on social welfare, pensions and benefits. Only 8% derive most of their income from employment, while a further 8% have no means of subsistence and are dependent on third persons.

<p>In the light of the above, will the Commission increase the financial aid under the Structural Funds to improve access to vocational training for the disabled so as to enable them to improve their level of education?

<p>(EN) Promoting the full integration and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of society is a key element of EU policies. Article 16 of the draft Structural Funds' General Regulation prohibits discrimination in the implementation and access to the funds on the basis of disability. Moreover, it requires that "accessibility for disabled persons shall be one of the criteria to be observed in defining operations co-financed by the Funds and to be taken into account during the various stages of implementation".</p>
<p>The European Social Fund (ESF) aims at improving employment opportunities for all. Since disabled people constitute a particularly vulnerable group with low employment rates, it is important to pay particular attention to their integration in the labour market. Promoting the social inclusion of people at a disadvantage, including people with disabilities, is a key area of support of the ESF. The draft Community Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion also highlight the importance of addressing the employment needs of disabled people and calls Member States to pay particular attention to addressing the needs of disadvantaged groups in terms of training.</p>
<p>Actions to improve access to vocational training for the disabled people and support for preparing young disabled people for work are important areas where the ESF may intervene and co-finance activities. Such activities should be programmed in the national strategies (National Strategic Reference Frameworks) and Operational Programmes drafted by Member States and agreed with the Commission. Financial allocations are also drawn up by the Member States and agreed with the Commission only at the level of priority axis, which is generally set up at a broader level. The Commission, however, shares the view that national programmes should pay adequate attention to the integration of people with disabilities in the labour market and increase their educational level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0591"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU's Jobs and Growth Strategy and the Employment Guidelines provide the political framework for action to address youth unemployment. The Guidelines call for more efforts to develop employment pathways for young people and for more and better investment in education and training. The guidelines also underline that increasing the level of investment is not enough, but that adaptation and capacity-building of education and training systems is necessary to improve their labour market relevance, their responsiveness to the needs of the knowledge-based economy and society and their efficiency.</p>
<p>At the Spring Council 2006, Heads of State and Governments confirmed their commitment to combat youth unemployment, through providing every young unemployed person with the opportunity for a new start in the form of training, retraining, work practice, a job or other employability measure within six months of unemployment. As part of the monitoring of the National Reform Programmes submitted by Member States each autumn, the Commission will pay particular attention to questions relating to youth employment.</p>
<p>Youth employment issues have also taken a high profile in the Commission's Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion for the period 2007-2013 as well as in the new European Social Fund (ESF) Regulation. The ESF provides financial support to Member States to combat youth unemployment and to improve education and training systems.

<p>It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure the correct and effective application of these directives. The States must take every necessary measure to ensure that they are fully effective, in particular ensuring that sanctions in the event of violation of Community law are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that the Member States apply Community law. Complaints relating to actions or omissions by an individual person or body are dealt with by the Commission in the event that public authorities are involved or have failed to act in response to these actions or omissions.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 138 of the EC Treaty, the Commission consults the social partners twice before presenting proposals in the field of social policy. On 20 April 2004, the Commission began the first phase of consultation of the social partners on the re-examination of the directive on European Works Councils. On 31 March 2005, within the framework of the Communication “restructuring and employment”<a href="#defann_44_6" name="refann_44_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, the Commission began the second phase of consultation of the social partners, on the issue of European Works Councils and on that of restructurings jointly. In it, the Commission encourages the social partners to intensify their joint work and to negotiate with a view to improving the functioning and efficiency of the European Works Councils, particularly with regard to their role in the anticipation and management of change.</p>
<p>At the tripartite Social Summit of 23 March 2006, the European social partners presented their working programme 2006-2008, in which they state that they will “complete the national studies on economic and social change in the EU 10, enlarge them to cover the EU 15 and on that basis promote and assess the orientations for reference on managing change and its social consequences and the joint lessons learned on EWCs”. The Commission will constantly assess the results of this work and, if necessary, could take any necessary further action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>During the period 2000-2006, the French region of Hainaut (Valenciennois, Sambre-Avesnois, Douaisis) received a total of €405 million from Objective 1 now referred to as Convergence. Over the same period, the Belgian region of Hainaut was entitled to €644 million.</p>
<p>At the European summit in December an amount of €70 million was allocated to compensate for the end of Objective 1 although the Belgian region of Hainaut will have €577 million under the Convergence objective for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>These figures do not add up. As the French region of Hainaut has the same ratios as the Belgian region of Hainaut, it should receive €360 million.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to confirm this decision, thereby accentuating the discrepancy in treatment between the French and Belgian regions of Hainaut and creating unfair competition between the areas, jeopardising efforts to forge partnerships between the two regions, or will it grant an exemption to allow the French region of Hainaut to benefit from Convergence funds as was the case in 2000?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The only statistical criterion for a region to be eligible for the “convergence” objective is GDP per inhabitant calculated at “level 2” of the system for classification of European regions known as “NUTS”<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It must be less than 75% of the Community average. This is not the case for any French metropolitan region.</p>
<p>The calculation of GDP per inhabitant operates exclusively on a regional basis (at NUTS level 2). This calculation provides the basis for the financial allocations for each Member State in question. Levels beneath that of region, such as départements (NUTS level 3) or even smaller, such as arrondissements, cannot under any circumstances constitute specific territories subject to their own eligibility rules.</p>
<p>No parallel can be drawn with the Belgian region of Hainaut, since this region, unlike the French region of Hainaut, is a NUTS 2 region and it conforms to the eligibility criterion of the future 'convergence' objective for regions affected by the statistical effect of enlargement.</p>
<p>The involvement of the Structural Funds for 2007-2013 will not just concern the least developed regions, eligible for the ‘convergence’ objective, but it will also cover all others within the context of the ‘regional competitiveness and employment' objective. On the basis of a proposal from the French authorities, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, taken as a whole, will receive an envelope of around EUR 926 million within the framework of the 'regional competitiveness and employment' objective. It will therefore remain the French metropolitan region receiving the most funds for a third successive programming period. Within this regional framework, the French region of Hainaut will therefore be able to receive European funds. This envelope includes an additional sum of EUR 70 million for the French Region of Hainaut, decided upon by the European Council, which will enhance the lever effect of the Structural Funds on the territory of these three arrondissements.</p>
<p>It will fall to the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, during the programming, to define its priorities for the future programming period. It will therefore fall to the regional partnership to establish its approach to using the funds.</p>
<p>Within the context of the negotiation of the operational programmes, the Commission will ensure that financial resources are used in accordance with the relative disparities within each region.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have the power to alter the allocations of the different objectives decided upon by the Council and Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of February 2006 the Commission adopted the White Paper on a European Communication Policy<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which proposes a fundamentally new approach to be followed regarding information and communication activities on European issues. In particular, the White Paper proposes a citizens’ centred approach in communicating Europe, and invites all EU institutions, Member States and other relevant stakeholders to join forces to address the “communication gap” with citizens.</p>
<p>A public consultation is currently ongoing (deadline for submissions has been prolonged until the 30<span class="sup">th </span>September 2006) with a view to collecting the reactions to the Commission proposals and to feed new ideas into the process. Only at the end of the consultation, and on the basis of the contributions received from the other institutions, will the Commission propose concrete measures and actions for the years to come.</p>
<p>Connecting Europe with citizens is also at the very heart of Plan D<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate. By presenting it, the Commission has shown its willingness to fulfil the “special role” assigned by the Heads of States and Government in June 2005. Many of the 13 different actions foreseen in the framework of Plan D are particularly important in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens.</p>
<p>At present, these initiatives are beginning to show results in terms of reaching the citizens: The web-based forum ‘DebateEurope’ has received the contributions of over 10.000 citizens from all countries in all EU languages. Commissioners have been active in visiting Member States, including visits in the national Parliaments. The Commission Representations, together with the Parliament information offices, have been active in reaching out to citizens (several hundred projects have taken place).</p>
<p>However, it should be recalled that Member States remain primarily responsible for the organisation of debates at national, regional and local levels. The role of the Commission in the framework of Plan D is to help structure the debate, providing Member States with organisational help and, if necessary and possible, financial support.</p>
<p>It has always been the Commission’s intention to pursue dialogue and debate beyond June 2006, and to promote a true and long-lasting listening exercise between citizens and European institutions. In order to go to the second stage of plan D, the “explaining phase”, some new actions will be set up by the Commission. To do so, with view of the results of the European Council of June 2006 and of the Parliament, the current above-mentioned actions will continue and will be enhanced. Some of the initiatives, such as the support to citizens’ transnational projects, will be developed in the second half of 2006.</p>
<p>Both communications of the Commission to the June 2006 European Council underline these issues; i.e. “A citizens’ Agenda for Europe” and “The period of reflection and Plan D”. The Commission’s plans for the next 6 months will therefore concentrate on the effective implementation of those of the actions in Plan D, which maximize citizen involvement and have proven to be successful. Moreover, Plan D will be extended to cover citizen to citizen initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Community action for the audiovisual sector within the European Union takes the form of the MEDIA Plus and MEDIA Training Programmes. MEDIA runs from 2001-2006 and has a budget of €513 million. It co-finances training initiatives for audiovisual industry professionals, the development of production projects (feature films, television drama, documentaries, animation and new media), and the distribution and promotion of European audiovisual works. Pilot projects are used to support the use of new technologies in the development, production and distribution stages.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the MEDIA Plus Programme is respect for and promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity in Europe. One of the actions in this respect is to award subsidies for dubbing or subtitling of films at the request of distributors. However, the Programme leaves the choice of language to the applicant and the promotion of the use of the Irish language is not as such an objective of the MEDIA Programme.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the European Union’s TV information service Europe by Satellite (EbS) is now technically equipped to transmit the Irish language when available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0534"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission negotiating team is currently in Geneva, taking part in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade negotiations at Ministerial level. The Commission will be in a position to report and assess the results of the meetings when they are completed on 2 July 2006.</p>
<p>As Commissioner in charge of Trade explained to the INTA Committee on 29 May 2006, there is a window of opportunity for a deal in the coming weeks. But it requires that all major players undergo a difficult but necessary adjustment of their positions so that they can converge on a middle way that brings sufficient gain to all.</p>
<p>For the EU, the Commission made clear that we are prepared to find ways to improve its offer on agriculture market access, to bring it closer to the requests made by the G20 group while staying within its mandate from the Council. But we will only take a new offer if, at the same time, others come with satisfactory offers in agriculture domestic support and industrial tariffs. There remains at present some uncertainty about the position of the United States (US). This is not surprising given the change at the helm of USTR (United States Trade Representative).</p>
<p>The Commission hopes the US can respond to the WTO Director General’s request for major players to show further flexibility. If the US can come closer to what the G20 developing countries are seeking in the reduction of farm subsidies - as we can on market access – the Commission is confident that a deal will be in sight.</p>
<p>Another condition is that the most advanced developing countries will have to be prepared to reduce their applied industrial tariffs to a level that gives some real new market access to European, US and other exporters.</p>
<p>Of course, contributions to the Round should be based on each developing country’s capacity to contribute. This remains a Development Round. Above all we must bear in mind that the poorest countries have different negotiating priorities, such as agricultural commodity tariffs, preference erosion, protection of small and weak economies, and trade capacity, which we must also address.</p>
<p>Finally, let us also recall that the outcome on the modalities for agriculture and industrial goods will be significantly influenced by the progress we can make on further liberalisation in the services sector and strengthening WTO rules, including Geographical indications. In the negotiations on agriculture we also need to achieve "parallelism" for the elimination of all form of export subsidies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0538"></a>

<p>(EN) As far as it concerns charging for heavy goods vehicles, the Eurovignette Directive<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> into force at the time in which the facts took place provided the legal frame for levying tolls or user charges on motorways. The Directive applied for heavy goods vehicles of at least 12 tonnes mass but Member States were free to apply road charges also for vehicles below 12 tonnes mass. Austria charges vehicles of 3,5 tonnes mass or more when using motorways and requires that these vehicles are equipped with a self-adhesive little plastic box in the driver cabin. Similarly as with the London congestion fee, the information that the use of Austrian motorways is subject to a road toll is clearly displayed on road signs before entering the charged section. The necessary box can be purchased at 220 selling points in and outside Austria, including all main petrol stations alongside the main Austrian transit roads, and costs only €5. When returning the box to any selling point the purchasing price is reimbursed.</p>
<p>The Commission regret that the person was not made aware by the hiring company.</p>
<p>As far as the amount of fine is concerned there is of course the possibility to lodge an official complaint to the Austrian authorities who have levied the fine and to go to court if the levied fine is considered as not proportionate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Professor Jáuregui was invited by the Commission to Brussels as an expert on two occasions (14 May 2003 and 5 April 2004).

<p>(EN) As explained in the 2006 Bathing Water Report, compliance of inland bathing sites showed a decrease of 3.8 % in comparison with 2005 Report results (from 89.4% to 85.6%). These figures do not take into account the de-listed freshwater sites. Detailed statistics are available in the bathing water reports which are on the web<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>From the figures in the report it can be observed that the decrease of 3.8% in compliance rates for EU-25 compared to the previous season is entirely due to the increase by 3.8% of sites which are not sufficiently sampled. It should be noted that the compliance rates for inland sites in the former EU-15 remained relative high (91.4%) and stable compared to the previous year. The situation in the EU-10 is significantly different however.</p>
<p>The issue of areas insufficiently frequently sampled is for many bathing sites related to the fact that several new Member States reduced their sampling frequency on the basis of results in water quality prior to their accession to the EU. The Commission already informed Member States last year that at least 2 consecutive years with compliance of bathing water standards is required after date of accession before sampling may be reduced. The Commission expects that a change will be implemented for the bathing season 2006.</p>
<p>Further examination of all inland sites including those not sufficiently sampled shows that, for the 4 new Member States who reported for the first time this year, only 51.3% of a total of 731 sites comply with the minimum water quality values. There exists therefore equally a problem in EU-10 of sites not complying with the water quality standards.</p>
<p>It should be noted that new Member States did not have any transitional period for the implementation of the Bathing Water Directive. Bathing waters were therefore required to comply with the Bathing Water Directive on the date of accession.</p>
<p>The Commission will address a detailed letter to Member States that have a significant portion of sites not complying with the minimum water quality standards and/or sites that are not sufficiently sampled. Member States will be required to indicate those measures that are taken (i) to trace and tackle the sources of pollution and (ii) to protect the health of bathers in waters which are not meeting the minimum standards. If necessary, the Commission will examine at a later stage launching infringements procedures under article 226 EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Remedying the lack of complete and comparable data on mental health and mental disorders in the European Union is one of the great challenges, which was highlighted in the Commission’s Green paper on Mental Health of October 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission does not at this stage have data about the levels of mental health problems in different professions, and in particular in the legal profession.</p>
<p>However, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to a report “Types of employment and health in the European Union”. Another study “Work-related stress” of 2005 identified seven sectors at increased risk of stress. The sectors ranking at the top of stress levels were health and social services and education. Both of these studies were published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Work and Living Conditions in 2002 and are available on its website.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in 2007 an ad hoc module on accidents at work and work-related health problems of the Eurostat’s Labour Force Survey will include variables on work-related mental health-related issues. It will thus be possible to link this information to the occupation of the respondent. The results of the survey will be available in 2008.</p>
<p>Similarly, the future European Health Interview Survey, an instrument in the field of public health statistics, will in the coming years collect data about psychological distress and mental wellbeing, which can be linked with occupations.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is now analysing the about 250 responses to the Mental Health Green paper consultation.</p>
<p>In deciding on the follow-up to the Green paper, the issue of actions to improve the availability of mental health statistics for the EU will need to be assessed.</p>
<p>The continuous improvement of well-being at work is indeed a major preoccupation of the European Union, as stated in the Communication from the Commission - Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The Commission will present a first assessment of the results achieved over the 2000-2006 programming period in the fourth report on economic and social cohesion which will be published in 2007. The analysis will draw mainly on the mid-term evaluations updates carried out under the responsibility of the Member States and the strategic evaluation launched at the initiative of the Commission. The proper ex-post evaluations will be launched in 2007 and completed by 2009 in close cooperation with the Member States.</p>
<p>Under three generations of cohesion policy programmes since 1989, a major investment effort has been organised at Community level to promote growth and convergence, competitiveness and employment. To this effort at Community level resources have been added at national level, both public and private, in view of the rules that European programmes must always be co-financed by Member States. In the absence of EU cohesion programmes, it is most unlikely that such an effort would have been maintained with the same multi-annual consistency and determination.</p>
<p>Rather, the evidence suggests that the weaker national budgets in poorer Member States, less developed capital markets, lower levels of qualification of the labour force and poorer infrastructures would have made it much more difficult to raise economic performance. The likely outcome would be a widening of the gaps in the Union.</p>
<p>That said national co-financing remains a key principle of cohesion policy to ensure common ownership of strategies and programmes and the responsibility of the Member States and regions concerned to use Community funding on the basis of sound management. The Commission notes that maximum co-financing rates will be substantially increased for the programmes of the next period 2007-2013 compared to the current period. The Commission therefore considers that it is not appropriate to further reduce the minimum obligatory mobilisation of national resources to co-finance cohesion policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0585"></a>

<p>(EN) In line with the Conclusions drawn in November 2004 by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers concerning the simplification of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for fruit and vegetables, the Commission has adopted on 28 June 2006 a report that contains an analysis of the Community market for soft fruit intended for processing.</p>
<p>Work on this analysis implied to carry out missions in the concerned Member States to collect relevant information. Missions took place in the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland (two missions) and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>This analysis covers four major EU sub-sectors: blackcurrants, cherries, raspberries and strawberries.</p>
<p>The Commission has identified three main categories of factors that have created difficulties in the sector:</p>
<p>Imports of frozen strawberries - anti-dumping investigations concerning imports from China are on-going. Nothing can yet be said on the possible outcome of these investigations.</p>
<p>Excessive production in comparison with market needs (blackcurrants, sour cherries). Rural development programmes can be mobilised to facilitate farm reorientation towards other activities. On the demand side, promotion and rural development measures can be mobilised to increase consumption and exports opportunities.</p>
<p>The competitiveness of the sector is constrained by fragmented commodity chains. In particular, fragmentation of production and of marketing to the industry imposes a heavy burden. Existing instruments in both the CMO for fruits and vegetables and in Rural Development programmes can be mobilised to foster the competitiveness of the sector.</p>
<p>In order to improve the monitoring of the economic situation in the sector at EU level, it could be envisaged to establish regular meetings of concerned experts in Brussels, as is currently done for some other fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>In the context of the reform of CMO fruit and vegetables, the results of the report will be duly considered.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
