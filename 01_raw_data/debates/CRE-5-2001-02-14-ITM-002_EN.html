<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, after lengthy pronouncements and promises, the European Union – or to be more precise, the Helsinki European Council – has formally recognised Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union. And the purpose of our debate and vote today is also to bring Turkey closer to this membership, or, more precisely, to the possibility of opening negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I would hope, we adopt my report here today and the Council reaches a decision along similar lines, the ball will be well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch. Turkey will then have to act. The time for reaction – as has happened all too often with Turkey – will have passed, and Turkey will have to take the crucial steps. For it must be clear, ladies and gentlemen – and I include our colleagues from Turkey who may be following this debate today – that the Copenhagen criteria must be fulfilled prior to the opening of negotiations. We have not negotiated with any candidate before the political criteria were fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">So in this sense, we are demanding that Turkey meet the same conditions as all the other candidates. Turkey is neither privileged nor disadvantaged. That is the essence of my report, and it is also the essence of those paragraphs – which, however, have apparently now been called into question – which aim to ensure that Turkey has the same status as all the other candidates. After all, it makes little sense to talk about equal treatment for Turkey, and impose the same obligations on Turkey, if we are not prepared to grant it the same rights as well. And of course it will be a very difficult path – in Turkey, and for Turkey – to fulfil the criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least three significant trends in Turkey: those who are pro-Europe because they support democracy, transparency and respect for human and minority rights; those who are pro-Europe but have substantial doubts about adopting European values and fundamental rights; and those who are fundamentally opposed to Europe, largely because they are sceptical about the adoption of the basic rights and values to which we in Europe are committed.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is up to Turkey to take the domestic policy decisions. Certainly, I believe that we – this Parliament – should send out a clear signal that the forces in Turkey which want to follow the path towards Europe and full democracy have our support. And that is the essence of my report as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Turkey will make substantial progress in the coming years. Some people harbour the illusion that negotiations could begin in one or two years' time. I don't want to discourage or disappoint anyone, but it will take several years. But one thing must also be clear, in my view: if it genuinely proves impossible to open negotiations within a specific period – which in my personal opinion should be around five years – because the political criteria have not been fulfilled, the European Union and Turkey must consider another form of partnership. For we are Turkey's partners anyway, and we must be good partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – I would not wish to deny this – Turkey is a key economic factor. And indeed, we should not deny this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Europe has a significant interest in ensuring that there is at least one stable major country in this crisis-torn region.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have no interest in abandoning Turkey to the Islamic fundamentalists, for we are opposed to all religious or other forms of fundamentalism on principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there are regional problems to be resolved: improving relations with Greece, and especially the Cyprus issue. I should like to come back to this point in a moment. Turkey must understand that we demand every candidate country's absolute willingness to maintain good relations with its neighbours. A key element of the preparations for negotiations with Turkey is that it regulates its relations with Greece in a positive way and contributes significantly to the resolution of the Cyprus issue. It is a difficult issue. All sides, and everyone concerned, must play their part in settling the Cyprus issue; this naturally includes the representatives of the Turkish community and especially Turkey itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with two further brief comments. Firstly, on the Kurdish issue: it goes without saying that resolving the problems with the Kurdish community in Turkey also features on the agenda. We have stated quite clearly that the use of the Kurdish language – also in the media – and the fostering of, and the opportunity to express, Kurdish identity are key factors in changing the political conditions in Turkey as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Armenia issue is concerned, I personally am opposed to the notion that foreign parliaments should seek to judge history and events which took place a hundred years ago. But I am also opposed to the exploitation of this issue for nationalist purposes in Turkey. A more relaxed and, above all, a more active role in the Armenia issue would be helpful. If Turkey were to take steps to invite its own historians and those from Armenia and third countries to come together to discuss this issue, this would also be a step forward towards a sensible debate about this question.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to adopt my proposal in order to give Turkey the opportunity to prove that it wishes to follow the path towards Europe.</p>

The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has taken account of all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The following points were important for the Committee on Budgets. The first appeared to be a budgetary matter, but it is actually a political issue. The Committee on Budgets called for the appropriations for Turkey to be switched from Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective, i.e. external action, to Heading 7, i.e. Pre-accession Aid, in order to reflect Turkey's status as a candidate for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">In a further proposed amendment, the Committee on Budgets made it clear that the volume of Community assistance should be determined annually by the budgetary authority, i.e. the Council and Parliament, as part of the budgetary procedure. Two further proposed amendments concerned the need for consultation with Parliament as part of the cooperation with Turkey, firstly when the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership are decided, and, secondly, when appropriate steps are agreed in the event that commitments are not respected by Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">As all the points put forward by the Committee on Budgets have been taken up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we are quite satisfied from a budgetary point of view. Indeed, as far as the financial aspects are concerned, the Committee on Foreign Affairs actually went even further, for example with its proposed amendment on Turkey's inclusion in the other financial instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one last comment: in the coming years, we will all have to push hard for real new money to be made available to Turkey, which is now a candidate country – and indeed to the other candidates for accession – rather than merely bundling the existing programmes together. Without new money, the candidates for accession will be unable to fulfil the criteria which we have established for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, first of all, I have a great deal of respect for Mr Swoboda’s report, which, in particular, deals expertly with a number of technical points relating to Turkey, but, of course, this goes beyond the technical.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that there is a difference between Turkey, a candidate country which is not in a position to engage in accession negotiations yet because the political Copenhagen criteria have not been fulfilled yet, and other candidate countries that <span class="italic">are </span>involved in the negotiation process leading to EU membership. This distinction has been drawn on sensible political grounds. It will also be reflected in our financial dealings with Turkey, as compared with our dealings with other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to make the point that whilst in general, the positive attitude towards Turkey expressed in the report certainly appeals to our group, we have the feeling it goes a little too far on one particular point, and I would specifically like to hear the Commission’s opinion on this. I am referring to Amendment No 1, which states that Turkey should be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments in order to ensure that all candidate countries are treated equally. I do not think that such a step constitutes equal treatment in the real sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, if the political situation was not to our liking, or if we felt it left something to be desired in certain countries, then we have said that we would take this into account on all kinds of different points. We would then draw a distinction on the point in question, irrespective as to whether it was a large country or a small one that we had certain political objections to. Only yesterday, I had a detailed discussion with the excellent Turkish Ambassador about these matters. It comes down to the question of what has to change in a country for it to become a fully-fledged candidate country involved in accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">If ISPA and SAPARD are already being discussed – and these instruments were not intended for Turkey hitherto – then Amendment No 1 would mean money being taken out of the budgets intended for the candidate countries currently engaged in accession negotiations. In other words, we are talking about those countries that have fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria, for example. I have a feeling this would have a demoralising effect. I would specifically like to know from the Commission to what extent this would actually have financial implications. How would Amendment No 1 actually affect the other candidate countries? Would it mean a cut in the budget for the other candidate countries we are negotiating with, for Turkey’s benefit? What exactly is the situation? If that were so, I would find it most strange. Or is it perhaps the case that the Financial Perspective could be extended, allowing Amendment No 1 to be implemented without adversely affecting the other candidate countries? I think that technically speaking, it would be extremely difficult to effect this budgetary change. So on this one point, I would very much like a clear answer from the Commission as to the impact that Amendment No 1 will have. Because the fact is that our group has some major doubts about accepting something that will have such a negative impact, particularly on the other candidate countries, with whom negotiations are proceeding well. That does not seem to us to be fair, and so we should rethink the situation. If we want to do something for Turkey then there is always the Customs Union. We are neglecting this at the moment. I fully understand people’s irritation over this, also in the financial sense. We must bring these matters to a sound conclusion. I could not agree more. If we can do all these things better, technically speaking, by amalgamating instruments for example, then this is what we must do. But taking budgets away from candidate countries that we are negotiating with over accession, for the benefit of a candidate country that has not yet reached this stage, seems to me to be a very sore point. On behalf of my group, I would be grateful if the Commission could tell us just exactly what the score is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, Mr Swoboda's report is not a standard procedural report, because the country which is the subject of the report is not a standard candidate country. It is a large country and it is very different from the other candidate countries. This difference provokes certain general comments. Turkey's candidacy puts not just Turkey, but the European Union to the test. It is not just Turkey, ladies and gentlemen, which is sitting exams in order to become a member. In this particular case, the European Union is also sitting exams, in numerous subjects. First of all, in the subject of religious tolerance. The opinion which, I think, prevails among most European citizens, is that a different religion should not be an obstacle to the accession of a new member. In democratic Europe, we are proud of our religious tolerance, but we have never been asked to put it to the test as we are now. It is a crucial test of the sincerity of our declarations and we must not flunk it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second exam which we are sitting is in powers of persuasion, i.e. our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of substantive acceptance<span class="bold"> </span>of our democratic institutions. I stress substantive acceptance<span class="bold"> </span>because Turkey has not refused to accept democracy formally; hardly anyone in the world today does. However, there is a wide body of opinion which believes that a democratic state starts and ends with a multi-party system and regular elections. Obviously that will not suffice. It is here, with the substantive acceptance of democracy, that Turkey's development post-Helsinki gives rise to serious questions. Turkey creates the impression, following the European Council's gesture in December 1999, which was welcomed joyfully by the Turkish people, that it is moving away from – rather than towards – a substantive democracy. The amnesty law passed freed many a criminal; but it did not free people sentenced for daring to express an opinion or talk their own language. Leyla Zana, the European Parliament Sakharov prizewinner, is still in jail. The state of emergency persists in south-eastern Turkey and cadres of the legal Kurdish party HADEP have disappeared in the region and been declared missing. The tragedy provoked when the security forces stormed the jails caused public outrage. We expect to see Turkey move forward; instead all we see is it moving backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also sitting exams in our ability to persuade Turkey of the value of peaceful relations between former enemies. Here Turkey's conduct shows a regressive trend. We expect words of reconciliation on Cyprus; instead all we hear is the clang of arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in the Middle Ages, Turkey and its army came knocking on Europe's door in Vienna. The door remained closed. Today Turkey is again knocking on our door, this time in peace, because over the intervening centuries, the real power has passed not to the advocates of military force but to the powers of liberty, democracy, rationalism and science. Herein lies the power of Great Europe and anyone who wants to share in Europe's greatness must truly espouse its principles; otherwise the door to Europe will remain firmly closed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group supports the regulation, not only because of its technical and financial value to Turkey, but also for the political message it sends. The regulation is a confidence-building measure. It shows we treat Turkey's candidacy for European membership with the respect that it surely deserves. It squares Turkey's candidacy with that of the other states, sending a signal that we will be fair and straightforward with Turkey and setting an example of the political consistency that we expect and require from the Turks.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation will trigger a raft of reforms. It is certain that the quality and pace of reform in Turkey will be driven by the developing relationship with the European Union. The next step must be the national plan, published quickly and fully responding to the Accession Partnership programme. We need this national plan to ensure that the momentum that supports European integration in Turkey does not diminish. We in the Liberal Group will assess this national programme for reform critically but fairly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If a country is a candidate country then a clear strategy and a clear financing package are required, just as they are for other candidate countries. It is a sound proposal and Mr Swoboda’s amendments improve on it. What is currently more interesting to my mind, is the question as to whether Turkey and the European Union have drawn closer together since the Helsinki decisions. My own group is still facing the same dilemma on that level. As you all know, we were, and still are, highly critical of the Turkish Government’s record as regards human rights, the position of the Kurds and the dominant position of the army. The crucial question then, and now, is what can, and must, the EU do to improve the situation? The answer then, and now, is that the only way to achieve this is through dialogue, in the context of enlargement and membership. This is also because the forces we are in touch with, the progressive forces, regard Europe’s support as something that will help them on their way to change. The question now is does this strategy work? I fear it is too early to say because the picture is extremely mixed. Let me cite the prisoners’ riot by way of example. Of course it was a step in the right direction to propose that, henceforth, there should no longer be thirty prisoners to one large cell, rather there should be single occupancy, or only a few people to a cell. Naturally, that is the kind of improvement we have always pushed for. However, the picture is greatly obscured by the fact that the regime in prisons is exactly as it always was. And this regime goes hand in hand with acts of torture, which are now said to be easier to perpetrate because of the individual cells. My group's response is that we must continue to pursue this strategy, but – and Mr Swoboda has also reminded us of this – there is absolutely no guarantee of success. The price of accession is high, high for the army and for the supporters of the monolithic unified state. Can we compel, or perhaps entice them to pay this price? It is the European Union’s responsibility to ask this question and have a crack at it. With that in mind, and as I said before, the regulation is a positive step and the amendments represent an improvement. However, it is up to Turkey – and that, I think, is what needs to emerge from this debate – to see whether these overtures towards the European Union are sincerely meant, because my group’s motto still holds good: no radical reforms without the prospect of membership, but without radical reforms, no prospect of membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think they would enhance the regulation. I would also like to thank him very much for his explanations. I do not want to repeat the criticism of the situation in Turkey which has already been expressed by Mr Swoboda, Mr Lagendijk and Mr Oostlander. The situation has certainly not improved in recent weeks and months. Our parliamentary group recently sent a delegation to Turkey; it came back with devastating reports from people affected, which we would gladly make available to the Commission, the Council Presidency or our parliamentary colleagues. But I do not want to go into that here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda, you said that the ball is now well and truly in the Turkish half of the pitch. What would be the result of this Austrian footballing analogy, I wonder? Which side will score? And if it is at the EU's end, is it an own goal? What we need, as I am sure you will agree, is for this process to set the ball rolling towards democracy, human rights, and the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. But I believe that in Turkey, the ball – which really is in the Turkish half of the pitch – is viewed in a completely different way. I believe that what has happened recently has been provocation. It is not an attempt to pursue the application for EU membership towards its proper goal; it is an end in itself, in order to secure financial resources, to utilise the benefits conferred by the Customs Union, or even to ensure that the criticism of the situation in Turkey is toned down.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the real issue which I would like to raise. Alongside the necessary and very candid criticism of the situation in Turkey, should we not be examining our own policies very critically as well? Since Helsinki – and, indeed, in Helsinki – it seems as if the Council and Commission have been the victims of their own propaganda, increasingly having to justify the fact that progress has been made. Mr Verheugen, you informed us here on 14 November that we have, and I quote, "good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform…".</p>
<p class="contents">I would claim that the reality is very different. I realise that diplomacy often has to work very cautiously, but we should not be taken in by our own propaganda, or Turkey's. We should approach the debate honestly and strengthen the forces of reform, thus opening the way for Turkey into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Queiró (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our position on Turkey’s accession to the European Union is well known. We clearly expressed this position in Parliament’s part-session last November during the debate on the report on the progress of Turkey’s preparations for accession. We have nothing against the great Turkish nation or against its close relationship with the European Union. In fact, the opposite is true. We simply feel that the traditional cautiousness that has characterised our attitude to Turkey’s candidature has been changed without any coherent political debate on the matter. Can the reasons for our cautiousness have disappeared or become less pressing? First of all, there is the geographical problem: do we no longer think that just a small portion of Turkey’s territory is actually part of the European continent? What new doctrine on the shape of Europe allows us to frame this new concept of external borders that would result from Turkey’s inclusion in the Union? Must Europe gain a new border, one that is not only outside Europe but which is riven with war and conflict? We only have to think of the possibility of being surrounded by countries such as Iran, Iraq or Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we say about the contrast with the democratic model shared by all Europeans, brought about by the countless restrictions that are, unfortunately, still being imposed in Turkey on the exercise of fundamental rights? How can we reconcile Turkey’s accession to the Union with its ongoing military conflict with Greece over Cyprus? What about the Kurdish question, which is making no progress? And what of the military’s influence over the regime which is still powerful? Lastly, does no one question the impact that the size of Turkey’s population will have on the social and economic cohesion of an enlarged Europe? Have all these issues changed or become significantly less serious? We do not think so. We even think that we are not alone in holding this opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The more optimistic among you will say that we are the ones who are failing to see the good progress that has been made to date. Is this the case? Let us see what the Commission’s latest report on the Turkish situation has to say. It does indeed acknowledge considerable progress in the field of macro-economic stability and in improving the most striking imbalances in Turkey’s economy. We are not naïve and realise that this is probably what counts. Turkey’s economic importance for the European Union today is considerable. In 2000, for example, the European Union was responsible for 52.9% of Turkey’s imports and 53.1% of its exports. Obviously, we cannot ignore this fact. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend reading this report in the light of respect for freedom of expression and of association, which the Commission has stated are being limited. The report should be read in the light of the situation in the field of economic, social and cultural rights, which the document says have not changed since 1999, in the light of the judicial system, whose functioning has still not been improved, and of corruption, which is still taking place at worrying levels. The report deals with the military dimension of the regime, torture and abuse, which are far from being totally eradicated and which lead the Commission to conclude that, and I quote, ‘with regard to the previous year’ – 1999 – ‘the situation on the ground has not improved and Turkey is not systematically fulfilling the Copenhagen political criteria’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the proposal for a Council regulation that we are going to vote on tomorrow creates a legal framework which will enable Turkey to benefit from a pre-accession strategy, just like the other candidate countries. This strategy provides for a kind of suspensive clause, which will be triggered specifically if there is insufficient progress towards fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. Parliament wants to be involved in this evaluation process, which is all well and good. In the meantime, however, given the real framework drawn up by the Commission itself, we need to ask whether this suspensive clause will be anything more than an example of political hypocrisy. Otherwise, we will only be able to conclude that what the Commission is proposing for Turkey gives partnership for accession with one hand and, with the other, suspends it indefinitely.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At any rate, it was a step too far for our taste. After all, the political and cultural divide between the two parties is far too wide. Ongoing tensions bear this out. Consider for example the current diplomatic clash between Paris and Ankara over the historical interpretation of the dreadful fate of the Armenian minority within the Osman Empire in 1915.</p>
<p class="contents">However, awarding Turkey candidate country status means that Europe now has certain obligations. The Commission, and not least the rapporteur, are approaching this in a fair and reasonable way, and so we will support Mr Swoboda’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Two elements of the proposed Accession Partnership have reinforced this decision. Firstly, the strengthening of the Customs Union between the European Community and Turkey, our alternative to the inevitable mutual trials that would result from Turkey’s accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Article 4 of the Commission proposal. If Turkey absolutely fails to make any discernible progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen accession criteria, i.e. if it fails to establish a functioning democratic constitutional state with protection for minorities, then we expect the Council and the Commission to take ‘appropriate measures’ in conformity with Article 4. Rapporteur Swoboda is right, in this specific case, to call for consultation of Parliament, which would be acting within the scope of its authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Ankara has still not set a course for Europe by implementing an unequivocal policy of reform. Yet it is still being given the chance to join the EU. We must now wait for a clear Turkish response, and that will demand a lot of patience on Europe’s part. However, we must not let ourselves be talked into simply disregarding our carefully compiled accession criteria for that reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the question is under what conditions and with what financial resources. A great deal has been said, quite rightly, about the human rights problems in Turkey, the Kurdish issue, and even recognition of the genocide against the Armenian people. I myself visited Turkey as a trial observer a few months ago at the invitation of a group of students, and it was not a very encouraging experience. It is interesting to note, for example, that the rapporteur himself, who has tabled a most interesting report, has changed his views on Turkey over recent years. But we should not reproach him for doing so, for everyone has the right to alter their opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial support for Turkey to boost those forces which want to move closer to Europe and achieve further improvements in democratic conditions must take place in tandem with observation of the human rights situation, however, and must not reduce the financial resources earmarked for other countries. So we are interested in the TDI's idea of setting up a kind of Council of the Wise, which would monitor human rights on an ongoing basis and make funding for specific projects conditional on improvements in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will certainly test the resolve of Turkey to carry out much-needed reforms in the area of human rights. A very topical aspect of this relates to freedom of expression, the functioning of the judicial system and the conditions in Turkish prisons. This has been mentioned by previous speakers this morning and I spoke on this subject during our debate last month.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption of a resolution by this House on the situation in Turkish prisons, I wrote to the Turkish authorities drawing particular attention to the request that Members of this Parliament should visit Turkish prisons to see the situation for themselves. On 5 February, I received a reply from the Turkish Ambassador informing me that the Turkish Ministry of Justice was willing to allow a delegation of MEPs to visit F-type prisons in order to see some of the problems and the steps being taken to overcome them. To my mind, this confirms the willingness of the Turkish authorities to engage with us in a positive and open manner. It also demonstrates that some understanding for the Turkish situation, some balance rather than a constant barrage of politically motivated reproach, is more likely to lead to improvement in those areas where we have justified criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Constant references to events which took place generations ago in different circumstances should be avoided. These merely serve to sustain generalised, stereotypical, negative images of Turkey and the Turkish peoples. In this context, Parliament's facilities should not be used for exhibitions designed to whip up hatred and I hope that this sentiment will be conveyed by the President to the Quaestors.</p>

Here today, we have made it clear that this accusation is untrue. The objective debate about Turkey, the speeches, the regulation, or at least the Commission's proposed regulation, and the rapporteur's report have in fact shown that the European Parliament is very keen to help Turkey and make it clear that there is absolutely no desire for hostility; instead, together with the people of Turkey, we want to welcome Turkey as a democratic country in the European Union one day, and are developing sensible proposals to this end. And here today, our colleagues from the Turkish Parliament are listening to us and following the debate. I would like to tell them something: we have no great interest in constantly talking about what is wrong in Turkey, but let me explain why we express criticism when they exercise their mandate in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We are politicians, and we rightly ask about the politicians. I have here a quote from a Turkish newspaper, not a Kurdish organisation's newspaper, and with your permission, I would like to read you an excerpt. It says, "Serdar Tanis, Chairman of HADEP in Silopi, and Ebubekir Deniz, HADEP secretary, have disappeared. On 25 January, they were summoned by the gendarmerie to the gendarmerie station in Silopi and have not been seen since." I think this is our problem. If this type of thing occurs again and again in Turkey and nothing is done about it, people will have to accept that our criticism is justified. Then they will have to admit that we are right to adopt a highly critical approach to the Turkish issue.</p>

<p class="contents">There is nothing unusual at all in the fact that Europe is helping Turkey on its way. However, we do expect that in return, Turkey will take our criticism seriously in the same spirit of trust and cooperation. The Swoboda report is a technical-financial report that follows logically from the Helsinki conclusions. But reading between the lines, it does highlight a very important message, namely Turkey belongs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group wholeheartedly supports this fundamental message. We are therefore disappointed that other noises are often to be heard from this Parliament. In particular, noises are occasionally heard from the right side of the House to the effect that Europe should remain a Christian club where Muslims are not welcome. We repudiate that kind of intolerance. Europe is a secular Community, a Community of equal rights, religious freedom and openness. Although there is still a long way to go, particularly in the field of human rights, Turkey will belong to this Europe one day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, even those in Turkey who believed that its accession would help democratise the country have come to realise, since Turkey was granted candidate status of the European Union, that the opposite is true. And, if you believed your own declarations on democracy and human rights, declarations which come thick and fast, you would not spend a single euro of the European Union taxpayers' money supporting a military regime which crassly tramples all over human rights. The money being given to the Turkish Government is in fact being spent on the continued repression of the Kurdish people and the refusal to find a political solution to the Kurdish problem. It is being spent on the continuing occupation of 38% of Cyprus and the solution, Mr Swoboda, does not lie in Greece or Cyprus, it lies in an end to this occupation and in the application of the UNO resolutions. And yet, even recently, Turkish leaders stated that the Cyprus problem was resolved in 1974.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding proposed by the Council and basically supported in the Swoboda report will be used not for the economic and social development of Turkey, but to support the repressive mechanisms of the Turkish state, which recently demonstrated what it is capable of by barbarically attacking the prisons, killing dozens of political prisoners on hunger strike, and by imprisoning and maltreating even children. The European Union's overtures to and funds for Turkey are encouraging the regime to continue and extend its inhumane, repressive policies and are being cited by the regime at home as Europe's acknowledgement of the fact that Turkey is a democratic country. Which is why our feelings of solidarity and brotherhood with the people of Turkey who suffer this policy require that we vote against the Council's proposal, which also illustrates just how hypocritical these declarations about democracy and the Swoboda report are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It considered that all of them, with only the exception of Turkey, were observing the political criteria set in Copenhagen. Despite that, a fortnight afterwards, Turkey attended for the first time the fourth conference on the European Union social funds. During the summit in Nice, Turkey promised that the new F-type prisons where physical and psychological torture exist would no longer be used. We all ought to read the report of the human rights mission from 26 December until New Year's Eve. This report has been presented in Brussels and shows the desperate situation of hundreds of prisoners in Turkish prisons, in particular those of Kurdish origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately. We do not need to go any further. This must be stopped right now.

This fact can never be underestimated – especially in the light of the situation that Turkey is officially a secular state, while its citizens are overwhelmingly Muslims. At the same time, modern Turkey is also the second land of the Bible, where Saint Paul built up his first Christian congregations.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question to the Commissioner and the Council is therefore: in which way are you prepared to help promote religious dialogue between Christians and Muslims?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is: what concrete measures are being taken to strengthen religious freedom in Turkey, the whole of the Middle East and North Africa? There are many of us wondering, especially millions of Coptic Christians in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss a practical case in Turkey. On 22 February the trial of the Syrian Christian priest Yusuf Akbulut will continue from December last year before the State Security Court in Diyarbakir. The prosecution derives from Section 312 of the penal code used to try several politicians and writers, including Yasar Kemal, in which actions which “openly stir up and incite the population” to animosity and hate by highlighting differences in religion, race, social class or geographical area are prohibited. Yusuf Akbulut is on trial for having been quoted in the newspaper <span class="italic">Huriyet </span>on 3 October 2000 as having welcomed the US Congress recognition of the genocide perpetrated against Armenians in 1915-1918. In this context he added the fact that other Christian peoples such as the Assyrians/Syrians were also murdered during the genocide. For these statements he risks several years of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">The trial raises a number of issues ranging from the absurd matter of having such a vague and, with regard to freedom of speech and opinion, unclear paragraph such as Section 312 in the penal code, to the evidence and the background to the case. We in the Christian Democratic parliamentary Group PPE-DE are following the case.</p>
<p class="contents">My third, and final, question to the Commissioner and to the Swedish Presidency is this: are you prepared to carefully monitor the case of Yusuf Akbulut? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we have to achieve is that, as the gap between Turkey and the European Union is reduced, the gap between Turkey and democracy, human rights and international resolutions is reduced proportionally. The truth, however, is that in recent times things have not been going well in this area in Turkey, where human rights are still being violated. For example, we know of the letter by Pierre Sané, the secretary of Amnesty International, to the Commission and Council at the end of last year, and also the threats in the last few days to Akin Birdal and the Turkish Human Rights Association, the persistent declarations by the Turkish authorities on the situation of the Kurdish people and the Cyprus conflict, and many other matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting the Swoboda report we will for the nth time be sending a positive message to Turkey: look, we in the European Union want our relations to get better and better and for you to be part of our great family, but for this to happen it is essential that you comply with democratic principles. We have to get this message understood by Ankara, but at the moment they do not want to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">The message is a positive response but with this reasoning, with these conditions, with this hope that demonstrable steps will effectively be taken in the immediate future. I can suggest some, such as freeing our Sakharov prize-winner Leyla Zana, taking a constructive and committed attitude towards Cyprus and the Kurds, and, of course, adopting the essential legal changes to certain laws which date from the military dictatorship and still do not respect human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regulation under discussion concerns pre-accession aid to Turkey. Turkey was accepted as a candidate country at the Helsinki Summit. For this reason, it would be appropriate if we treated it as we do the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Financial Perspective includes a Heading 7 covering pre-accession aid. Every year around three billion euros are set aside there – rather more than that, in fact. In the EU budget, however, pre-accession aid to Turkey, as with Cyprus and Malta also, has been placed under Heading 4, “External Action”. These countries are therefore actually accorded a different status from the other candidate countries. In addition, the same objective, that is to say, pre-accession aid, is being financed now from two different headings, which is blurring the transparency of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Heading 7, "Pre-accession Aid", has not been used correctly. Payment appropriations are lagging far behind committed appropriations, and this is thus clearly a case of over-budgeting, which is realised as unspent resources that are returning to the Member States. However, Heading 4, “External Action” has become over-burdened. For two years in succession now – at 200 million euros per year – a flexibility instrument has had to be used to finance it, something which in fact is Parliament’s own disposable fund for unforeseen expenses. Parliament has thus borne a greater responsibility for EU foreign policy than the Council. Budgeting for pre-accession aid for Turkey, Cyprus and Malta in Heading 4 has increased the over-burdening further and jeopardised the ready availability of these funds. For that reason I support the proposals in the report to switch these funds to Heading 7. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is one issue and it is a separate issue from the Swoboda report, which we are dealing with here, the philosophy behind which is that we should put Turkey, from the point of view of funding mechanisms, on the same basis as the other candidate countries. This position is wrong for three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason is because, in Turkey's case, the Copenhagen criteria have not yet been met. This distinguishes it from the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is because we should not discriminate. In the case of Slovakia, in the case of Slovenia, in the case of the Baltic states which failed to apply human rights or had other problems, the integration process, including funding, stopped until they came into line.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is because, if the European Union continues down this line, it is paving the way for a huge showdown with Turkey; it is writing out cheques which will be referred to drawer and at some point it will be called to account, whereas what we need is a policy of steady progress in which – if need be – the European Union takes the first, the second, the third, even the fourth step, but in which Turkey too takes a step. Just yesterday we were talking with Mr Verheugen about 12-year-old children who are in prison because they belong to the PKK, about Leyla Zana, who received the Sakharov prize and who is in prison. So let Turkey take a step on the Cyprus issue, on the Kurdish question and on human rights before we go down this line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, to be perfectly honest, I am beginning to wonder if Turkey wants the same thing. That notwithstanding, the message which we must send out is that, if Turkey joins the European Union, it must adjust to European standards and not the other way round, with the European Union adjusting to Turkish standards. To be honest, I am not sure if this message has got across – I am referring, Mr President, to the period following the approval of the partnership – and I should simply like to draw the House's attention to two facts.</p>
<p class="contents">First, to what happened in the Turkish jails which was condemned by the European Parliament. And, secondly, to the hard line stance taken by the Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash, who is refusing to sit down to inter-community talks and who is being encouraged in this stance by Turkey. Turkey has obligations on both these issues under the partnership agreement and is choosing to ignore them.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, even if you overlook Turkey's disdain, so far at least, for its obligations under the partnership agreement, you will be brought up short by Amendment No 1 proposing that Turkey participate in the ISPA and SAPARD programmes. This amendment is totally unacceptable and I will tell you just two reasons why. The first reason is that the budget for these programmes has already been decided. It was decided and agreed in Berlin – Mr Verheugen was personally involved in this agreement as Germany's Minister of European Affairs and knows all about it – and cannot be increased. Consequently, the only solution would be to cut the share of the other Central and Eastern European candidate countries, such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, etc., which would then receive less money. The second reason, and this is very important, is that, when it adopted the ISPA and SAPARD programmes, the European Parliament voted against amendments seeking to fund pre-accession tools, Cyprus and Malta from these programmes, on the grounds that Cyprus and Malta were being funded under the ΜΕDA programme. May I remind the House that Turkey also benefits from the MEDA programme. What I am wondering, therefore, is why we said no to Cyprus and Malta and are now preparing to say yes to Turkey. And I say this notwithstanding my immense appreciation for the report by Mr Swoboda, who has done sterling work here in the European Parliament. But that does not prevent me from disagreeing with this specific amendment for the reasons stated, reasons which are of a technical and a political nature.</p>

As a matter of fact, Turkey’s economic involvement with the European Union is already high, since more than half of Turkey’s imports come from the Union and more than half of its exports are destined for the European Union. Furthermore, Turkey is a member of NATO, which has a tradition of mutual recognition towards European countries that are members of the alliance. In addition to other aspects, particularly cultural ones, there are therefore bases on which progress can be made towards Turkey’s future membership of the European Union. This proposal for a regulation will now enable us to create the necessary legal basis to establish an Accession Partnership, in order to help Turkey fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. It will do so not only by intensifying the Customs Union, but also by promoting economic and social development, which are essential aspects of an effective partnership. We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposals that complement the spirit of the Commission’s initiative, particularly those that are designed to ensure that Turkey will benefit from the support provided by the Pre-Accession Structural Instrument and from the Special Programme for Agricultural and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, within the development strategy that we are advocating, the path towards economic and social development must go hand in hand with political development, in other words, the exercise of democracy and human rights. It is in this context that we wish to emphasise and support the content of Article 4 of the proposal for a regulation. We also feel that by playing a more effective role in this process, the European Parliament can make a contribution and provide certain guarantees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A dream of democratic European cooperation in which Turkey too participates on an equal footing, for Turkey is a part of Europe and has a lot to contribute to European cooperation. Turkey must make a choice, however: a choice between the future and a past characterised by ethnic oppression, torture, the death penalty and absence of legal security. The hunger strike in Turkish prisons – I myself spoke a short time ago with prisoners, their families and lawyers and a range of politicians when I travelled as part of a delegation to Istanbul – is an expression of a conflict which should belong to the past and which it will not be possible to solve until Turkey no longer opposes cultural, ethnic and political pluralism but instead uses these as a positive force in the development of a Turkish democracy. I should also like to call upon Turkey and the Commission to make special efforts to reconstruct the villages destroyed by Turkish authorities in eastern Turkey. I should also like to ask for efforts to be made to help the population to resume their normal lives in these villages. This might, for example, be via the project developed by, for example, Erik Siesby at the Danish Centre for Kurdish Human Rights, and I know that they have sent details of the project to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Swoboda report is one outcome of the Helsinki decision and is therefore important. Let me repeat, the issue is not "whether" there should be an Accession Partnership and pre-accession strategy, but "how".</p>
<p class="contents">In one respect, the Swoboda report goes far beyond the Commission's proposal in that it calls for Turkey to be included in the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments. This would have two consequences. Firstly, the ISPA and SAPARD financial instruments would have to be cut back, and secondly, the Berlin financial agreement would have to be cancelled. Both are highly unlikely scenarios. On the other budgetary aspects, I go along with the Swoboda report. I also think it is important that there should be no discrimination against Turkey. But SAPARD and ISPA are designed for transformation societies which are evolving from a communist planned economy to what is hopefully a social market economy. And of course this does not apply to Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the pre-accession strategy and Accession Partnership must be to achieve convergence between Turkey's political, economic and social conditions and the EU. It is essential that all candidates for accession are treated equally. But this does not require any additional resources, e.g. from PHARE, ISPA or SAPARD; it requires the same procedures as apply to the distribution of PHARE funding. I therefore call once more for Amendment No 1 of the Swoboda report to be rejected.</p>

We had concerns about Turkey's candidate status, but now it is here, and Turkey therefore also has the right to be included in the financial instruments. I say this without any ifs and buts. I welcome the fact that this regulation has now established clarity, especially as the European Union has actually done very little to fulfil its financial commitments towards Turkey since the conclusion of the Customs Union Treaty five years ago. So this is a fresh start which has our full support. As far as the two programmes are concerned, I wish I could agree with my colleague Mr Stenzel, but I must also point out that it is not enough for us to view the 177 million already envisaged for the pre-accession strategy as a general framework. As Mr Kuckelkorn has said, new money, i.e. additional funding, must be made available to Turkey for economic and social cohesion. This is our common concern, and we therefore support Mr Swoboda's report in general terms – not in every respect, and not all the proposed amendments, but its general trend.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation includes an Article 4 which allows funding to be suspended under certain circumstances. This Article 4 is necessary, and it is now up to Turkey to answer all the questions which we have been asking for years, and make progress with regard to a basic democratic structure, the role of the military in the National Security Council, and human and minority right. To our great regret, I believe that relatively little has been done in these areas in recent months; on the contrary, we have the impression that the progress initially achieved in the second half of 2000 has now been reversed and that the Turkish side – the government itself – has lost the courage to adopt these measures swiftly and resolutely.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 4 is not an instrument which can be used indiscriminately; it is only intended for the event that very serious shortcomings become evident in the pre-accession process, and I hope that it will not need to be used in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">But one thing must be clear: Turkey's accession to the European Union can only take place under the conditions set by Europe, not simply on Turkey's terms. So far, neither politics nor the government has addressed this misconception held by the Turkish public. So I would also ask our colleagues on the rostrum to help dispel this misconception at last. Accession will only take place on our terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   C<span class="italic">ommission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Swoboda on his report and to thank Parliament for an extremely constructive and responsible debate. I think you have sent a very positive and also a very clear and unambiguous signal to Turkey. I believe that, at the end of this debate, we can say that consensus regarding our policy towards Turkey has become much broader. We agree that the current situation regarding human rights, the protection of minorities and the quality of democracy and the rule of law in Turkey is not what we would wish for. Unfortunately, nothing has changed in that regard. There is no point glossing over this fact or remaining silent about what is actually happening. Because the situation is as it is, because it is so unsatisfactory, we have endlessly debated what political possibilities we have of changing it. This brings me to my second point.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that it is not only in Turkey’s interest but in the interest of Europe as a whole, and especially in the interest of the European Union, to have Turkey as a stable and reliable partner in the long term. I am sure everyone in this House will agree with me when I say the long-term stability of a state can only be guaranteed if this state is founded on the values we all share, such as democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of minorities. Thirdly, I think we agree that the prospect of membership of the European Union has been the central and most important catalyst for reform; at least this has been the case throughout the entire history of our enlargement process. If you look at the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the tremendous pace of reform they have embarked upon and the enormous success they have had, this has only come about because they had membership in their sights.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we must now answer is: can we achieve the same with Turkey? In Helsinki we said, yes, we should give it a go. We are now at a stage where the strategy adopted in Helsinki has become operational and we can therefore actually implement it. So there is little point in talking today about whether the strategy adopted in Helsinki has changed what is happening on the ground in Turkey or not. It simply has not. I would never say it has changed it, but the instruments of this strategy are just not in place. That is why one cannot say either that it has not had any results. With what is being discussed here today and what you will subsequently adopt, you are paving the way for the entry into force of the central element of this strategy, namely the accession partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Accession Partnership sets out our expectations of Turkey. It lays down what Turkey must do so that we can achieve the result that Turkey fulfils the political and other accession criteria. Once this document has been formally adopted – indeed it has not yet been adopted as we are waiting upon Parliament to express its opinion – we can expect an immediate answer from Turkey. This document will be the most important document in the history of Euro-Turkish relations over the past few decades.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have learned so far leads me to the belief that we are quite possibly on the brink of the most far-reaching political reform in the history of modern Turkey. That is not to say that today we can discover whether everything that Turkey says to us in its reply will be fully in line with our expectations. In this respect, Mr Swoboda is quite right when he says that the ball is now in Turkey’s court. It is really now up to Turkey what steps it takes, what rhythm it adopts and what qualitative efforts it puts into fulfilling the conditions for taking up negotiations on its membership of the European Union. That is why I underline what a number of speakers have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is an important country. Turkey is of particular strategic importance. But that does not mean that, because of Turkey’s strategic importance, the European Union can change its inner character. That can and must not happen. It is only right and proper that Turkey wants to join the European Union and not the other way round and that, for that very reason, the accession conditions we have drawn up for all are equally and fully valid for Turkey. Turkey will not become a member until it has fulfilled these accession conditions to the letter. Neither I nor anybody else knows whether the strategy we adopted in Helsinki, which is fully supported by Parliament, will have the desired effects. But we have for the first time reached the stage where Turkey must present us with a binding programme and must tell us what it intends to do to change conditions in Turkey. It will give us the opportunity to bring influence to bear on this programme, because it is a jointly agreed programme, because it is jointly financed by us and because we have the opportunity to influence it and monitor it.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that we have made enormous strides. As far as the financial and budgetary aspect is concerned, questions have been raised, which I will be pleased to answer. Firstly, all those who say that it would be logical to channel pre-accession aid for Turkey, Malta and Cyprus through the relevant Heading 7 of the Financial Perspective are quite right, as we are clearly dealing with pre-accession aid. The Commission would like this to happen too. But I must make it clear that this would not alter in any way the amount of money that was available. It would simply mean reducing the relevant Heading 4 and increasing Heading 7, which would not be of much benefit to Malta, Cyprus and Turkey, who naturally want more money. They do not want us to change the Heading, but more money.</p>
<p class="contents">But we do not have more money because the programmes in the Financial Perspective which was adopted in Berlin have been established. Nor are there any budgetary reserves. A Member of this House asked this question. No, we do not have any budgetary reserves in the pre-accession instruments. They have all been paid out. Only SAPARD was paid out rather late. That was because of the regulation for this instrument, but the funds that have been planned for 2000 will be fully paid out during the course of 2001. But we do not have any budgetary reserves there. We could only satisfy the desire, which was expressed by Mr Swoboda and is shared by many of you here, to increase pre-accession aid to Turkey, Malta and Cyprus in order to make the ISPA and SAPARD instruments accessible, by making available more budgetary resources, money which the Commission, at any rate, does not have. This must be discussed with the Council. The need may well be there, but I could not, at the moment, accede to the request. I feel bound to say in all honesty that the Commission would not be able to implement such a resolution because it simply does not have the money.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Stenzel was quite right to point out that naturally there is a difference between the candidate countries of Eastern and Central Europe, and Turkey, Malta and Cyprus. The candidate countries of Eastern and Central Europe not only have to adapt to the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, they also have to transform their entire economy. That is, in fact, the political basis for the situation we have today.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say finally that, in my estimation, in the year 2000 we set something in motion in Turkey. We, as politicians, know that the start of a political movement cannot be measured initially in real changes, be it in terms of prisons, NGOs, schools or whatever. No, the start of a political movement can only be measured in the way a society talks about the issues, what issues it talks about and what long-term objectives it sets itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection we can very clearly discern in Turkey a massive movement in the year 2000. In my opinion, the correct response for the European Union is to support such a political movement and to make the instruments available which we need to bring about tangible concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one last thing. We will not be able to measure the success of our pre-accession strategy towards Turkey by the promises made, i.e. we will not be able to measure it in terms of the editorial content of Turkish newspapers. But we will be able to measure the success of this strategy in what changes in concrete terms for the Turkish people, whose situations under current conditions are deplorable and in need of radical change. It will be measured in real structural changes and in real changes to people’s living conditions. When we see these changes, the time will have come to talk about the next step, but not today. I am pleased to have discovered such a broad consensus regarding this matter in this Parliament. I believe that it will help us a great deal if Turkey realises that the Council, Parliament and the Commission have, on this matter, adopted a firm common stance – at least in terms of the basic issues. Our steadfastness in this matter will help us to reach our goals.</p>

I am convinced that your report, Mr Swoboda, will play a key role in the difficult discussions we are all so involved in, namely how best to bring Turkey closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked to speak in order to reply on behalf of the Council to the question which Mr Sacrédeus addressed to the presidency concerning religious freedom and tolerance between religions in Turkey. Let me just say that we in the Council naturally see these issues as being extremely important. Our discussions with Turkey on religious freedom are, of course, based on the fundamental Copenhagen criteria and on what we encounter in the partnership with Turkey concerning fulfilment of the requirements to respect the rights of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sacrédeus takes up the important issue of how to stimulate dialogue between different religions in Turkey and generally. We see this as an important element, not only in the partnership with Turkey but generally in Europe-Mediterranean cooperation. As far as the Swedish Presidency is concerned, we have tried to build on some of our own experiences. For example, there is the Euro-Islam project and the conferences against intolerance which were recently held in Stockholm, and of which Mr Sacrédeus is no doubt aware. We have tried to build on experience from these and to introduce a number of similar ideas into the partnership with Turkey in order to highlight the importance of respect for religious freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sacrédeus also takes up the important issue of the trial of a Turkish priest. The Council is monitoring this matter extremely carefully. We know that the next trial hearing is on 22 February. The Council will be monitoring what happens then very carefully and we will react in a way we believe is appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
