<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past. This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission’s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies. The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports. I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things. Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting. This is an unwise policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management. All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates. They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the communication reveals the Commission’s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made. One can quote from the communication. Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent. That appeared in the communication published last July. Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000. Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species. These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities? The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced. Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party. Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources. More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas. Such pressures are greatest in Europe. In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.</p>
<p class="contents">A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative. Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time. The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish – not the fish themselves. Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system. However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes. The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector. I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism. I recommend the report to the House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy. After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies. But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual. The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard. One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.</p>
<p class="contents">All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected. Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries. This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.</p>

Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions. However, some people’s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators. I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions. If Mr Katiforis’s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious. Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport. To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong. Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.</p>
<p class="contents">Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly. According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea. Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee’s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks. As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea. Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated. However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations. Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment. As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries. The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone. As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept. Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back. The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear. This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector. It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message. Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first ‘environmental’ disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury. We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity. I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water. We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with <span class="italic">caulerpa taxifolia</span>, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive. It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%. It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment. So we must practise selective fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Aquaculture should also be monitored. Read Mr Katiforis’s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment. Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment. The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to touch briefly on these amendments. With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the report’s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea. In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management. More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that<span class="bold"> </span>fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs. And just as well, in my view. As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish. In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left. We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some people say in all seriousness that the decline in fishery stocks is caused solely by fishing. That is wrong of course and it also diverts attention from objective statements. I therefore call upon all parties involved to take account of the other factors causing reduced stocks as well, be they pollution, climate change, industrial activities, sea traffic etc.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Once again there has been an environmental tragedy off the coast of Europe, namely the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> off Brittany. A combination of the aforementioned factors and inadequate supervisory measures at European level are the primary causes of a debilitated marine environment. Fishing is an economic activity. If we want a strong fisheries sector then we need to have stocks to catch and a perfect environment for fish to reproduce in. The EU must develop conditions that will create a balance between environmental considerations and all other interests. That is why we completely oppose one-sided measures that attack and weaken the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is wrong to ignore the technical and environmental realities. Does it really make sense to equip boats less than twelve metres in length with a satellite control device? Does it make sense to bias our efforts in favour of promoting coastal fishing although it is neither particularly environmentally-friendly nor capable of being monitored to an adequate degree? These are just a few of the many questions raised by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">These examples show that it is simple enough to talk about fishing and the environment from a theoretical standpoint. However, it is far less easy to come up with constructive measures based on the principle of sustainable stocks management. We need even more wind in our sails here! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment. The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters. A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation. In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors. Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission’s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall, of course, be brief.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin. Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries. This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters. Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago. I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it. A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep. It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally. But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland. In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion. It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period. Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen. </p>
<p class="contents">It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland. That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide. And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen. We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Conservation of the marine ecosystem is both in the interests of fisheries management and of environmental protection. It is simply the case, Mr Nicholson, that we must succeed in crossing this divide between the measures that are deemed necessary and adopted here in Brussels, and the views and also justifiable interests of the fishermen in various parts of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion, sustainability is a principle that ought not solely to take account of environmental considerations, rather it is equally important to make economic and social considerations part of the concept. If we want to secure the sustainability of the European fisheries sector in economic and ecological terms, then we certainly have a lot of work to do there, although there have already been some developments along the right lines.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you of the measures for improving the selectivity of fishing gear which came into force this year. I would remind you of our decisions on setting catch quotas, so as to reduce fishing for threatened stocks by 40%. I would remind you of the introduction of protected areas, which also benefit sea birds, for example, and, lastly, I would just like to mention the long-term management strategies, which are based on applying the precautionary principle to ten of the most important fisheries stocks used for commercial purposes in Community waters. </p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As I said though, we still have a lot of work to do. In particular, we should, after thinking one or two things through, head in the direction of multiannual quota setting. This would help to secure long-term, sustainable fishing activities, and would afford fishermen a longer-term perspective and help them to plan with greater certainty. Short-term measures alone benefit neither the stocks nor the fishermen. However, if we are to take a fresh approach to this issue, then this requires a certain amount of political courage, and this goes for all parties involved, whether they are working at national or Community level. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the things the Commission is called upon to do in the amendments – which are also the subject of our debate – is to devote more funding to the fisheries policy. I must remind you at this point that the rules we work to have changed. The Berlin decisions have meant that there is no scope for fresh, new budgets or money. We have to operate under the terms of the financial framework that was placed at our disposal there.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">You also recommend extending coastal waters from a 12 to a 24 mile zone. I believe we will need to discuss this issue in great depth though, for we must not forget that this could bring major problems as well as benefits, particularly in the light of the fact that in so doing, we would actually be heading in the direction of a partial renationalisation of fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, though, this report demonstrates our commitment to the aforementioned aims, and we therefore welcome the support this report has received from the rapporteur, Mr Katiforis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
