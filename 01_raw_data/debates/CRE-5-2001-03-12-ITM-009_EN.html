<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gargani (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Monti, as Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, it is my duty tonight to explain our motive for tabling this question. Interpreting the contributions of my committee, I feel that the Commission has not always made much effort to provide an effective response to the issue of communication. The subject was debated a number of times within the committee and, on 14 April 2000, a year ago now, Commissioner Reding informed us that she was going to present a communication, a project, a strategy, but, so far, nothing has happened. There are delays which we cannot fail to highlight because we feel that the European Union's strategy is closely linked to information and communication. I believe that these are not rhetorical phrases but genuine questions specific to European integration, to the integration of a Europe which we want to be institutional and political as well as economic. The citizens must be kept informed, made aware of the European Union activities, at least where the three most important issues are concerned: enlargement, monetary union and European defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if the objective, as was stated at the Lisbon meeting, is for the economic side of things, for the economy to be knowledge-based as well, we cannot ignore the fact, Mr Monti, that the Union, which cannot and must not remain merely economic, is in need of a huge effort in terms of the citizens' awareness and their participation in the integration of this Europe if it is to become a political and civil Union as well. There is thus a contrast, and I would like to make this absolutely clear, between a euro which becomes tangible notes and coins, a currency that becomes a single currency, the euro, which will come into circulation next year, and a Charter of Fundamental Rights which was adopted at Nice, even though it has not been incorporated into the Treaties. My own personal conviction on this matter is that, although there is much criticism of the post-Nice process, every endeavour has been made to lay the foundations for a European Constitution. There had to be an initial stage of the establishment of certain fundamental rights of the European citizens first, and the project which has to be advanced and the development of the necessary cooperation between the Commission and Parliament are linked precisely to the possibility of designing, of formulating a European Constitution which establishes and affirms the rights of all the citizens. The process is a tedious one, however. There was a desire to do everything at once, forgetting that the institutional and legal processes are slow moving and must gradually involve the participation of all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, the issue of communication – as you see, Commissioner, this is not a piece of make-believe but something which is innate in the nature of the relationship between the institutions and the citizens and in the will to build a Europe of the citizens as well as an institutional Europe – is closely linked to a strategy, to a genuine communication project which, I regret to have to say, on behalf of the Committee, is lacking, despite the numerous debates which I have called for and which have taken place in committee and, quite frankly, despite the appeals made by all the groups to Commissioner Reding and President Prodi. We are appealing once again, this evening, to you, Mr Monti, for the motive for the question is linked precisely to this issue. I am sure that you will take these considerations fully on board, or rather, I must add, we must both take the issue on board so that the relationship between the Commission and Parliament is a productive, transparent and lasting one, as it is right that it should be in this legislature and as we are making every endeavour to ensure that it is. The Commission must take notice of what the Parliamentary committee and Parliament as a whole are trying to make them understand and are stating repeatedly. Therefore, if this evening's debate succeeds in furthering a closer relationship and obtaining a genuinely convincing response from you, then I think it will have been a very useful initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mr Gargani, for clearly illustrating the question on a subject to which the Commission, too, attaches the utmost importance. I will try to respond to the different parts of the oral question point by point.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all – point one – the communication on information policy planned by the Commission will be presented before the end of the summer and will then be presented to the Interinstitutional Committee, the Parliamentary Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, of which you are Chairman, Mr Gargani, and the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the development of information technology – point two – the Commission is taking this into account in a number of ways: combining all the communication instruments in a single Directorate-General, moving from a paper medium to an electronic medium, developing the second generation Europa server in accordance with the recommendations of the Lisbon Summit, and harmonising and developing the websites of the Union Representations with simplified portals linking all the departments of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission is enlisting the help of experts and professionals to develop its information policy, particularly as regards large-scale campaigns, such as those duly highlighted by Mr Gargani, on the enlargement of the Union and on the euro. The Commission is also enlisting the help of these professionals to provide training on information technologies; the citizens are being consulted via the countless debates on Europe organised in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference which will be stepped up on issues relating to the Future of Europe. The Representations<span class="bold"> </span>and networks of public information centres<span class="bold"> </span>make the practical concerns of the citizens known and, by listening to what they have to say, we can adapt the information strategy to the countries or other specific factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, what are the pillars? The main pillars announced in April 2000 by Commissioner Reding will be included in the Commission communication. Decentralisation will be examined in relation to some sectors of common interest and the Commission's new information policy will also take into account the principle of subsidiarity, which was clearly emphasised, moreover, by the Lisbon Conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Commission intends to develop a regional dimension for its information policy, in particular by means of paying closer attention to the regional press and the questions of local authorities. It also intends to continue to develop information centres – <span class="italic">Infopoints</span>– and what is known as rural <span class="italic">carrefour</span>, European documentation centres, in order to achieve sufficiently comprehensive regional coverage. The large communication centres such as those in Paris, Lisbon or Rome, which are often supplemented by regional and local networks, are a good example of cooperation between the institutions and the Member States, and they are points of reference for public information. The Internet is accessible at regional level, and the Commission also has eight representation offices in different regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, the Commission has combined all the communication instruments in a single service with the aim of stepping up the attention paid to opinions and reacting quickly through the most direct channels. It established, through the network of Representations and regional offices,<span class="bold"> </span>a rapid alert system capable of identifying the communication difficulties raised by certain matters of European relevance in order to be able to react with focused messages which are more suitable for a certain type of audience. With regard to public relations, within the framework of the action ‘The Future of Europe’, the Commission is going to launch a large-scale operation of listening to the citizens, in order to better identify the information that they wish to receive, by whom they wish to be informed, where and by what means of information. This action is part of the continuation of Dialogue on Europe, an action in which the European Parliament has participated fully.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the seventh point, the Commission is going to implement assessment mechanisms and parameters to measure effectiveness. The first way to assess an information policy is to carry out opinion polls in the 15 Member States. The standard Eurobarometer has been supplemented by a special Eurobarometer which can provide a more detailed, country-by-country analysis. The year 2001 will see the launch of studies on the cost-effectiveness of the Representations. Other monitoring instruments will be provided within the framework of the modernisation of the Commission's resource management policy<span class="bold"> </span>and, in particular, its Press and Communication Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, with regard to the eighth and last point, the Commission has instructed its Press and Communication Service<span class="bold"> </span>to develop a new initiative on cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in terms of information. A Technical Group on cooperation<span class="bold"> </span>has started work and all the main questions relating to the institutions, the euro, enlargement and the actions regarding the Future of Europe will be the subject of common communication strategies. There have been initial agreements between the Commission and the Member States on huge information campaigns about the euro. This effort must be continued and increased manifold. The Commission's appropriation for information is currently EUR 90 million, that is the equivalent of one copy of a newspaper per citizen per year. The size of the task in hand means that every Member State will have to bear the cost of the investment which is allocated to it, seeing as the provision of information on Europe concerns all the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Gargani again for having drawn our attention once again to these extremely important subjects. I have attempted, insofar as I am able, to present to you the main guidelines of the responses, and I can assure you that my colleagues in the Commission who are responsible for the matter are working extremely hard to respond to this great challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot imagine that you felt very comfortable this evening, because I should like to say to you that, although I hear your words, I cannot believe them. That is the problem. For months now, we have been waiting for something which will now – as you have again indicated today – perhaps be available in the summer, God – or whoever is going to do the work you mentioned – willing. I mean, if you take a dossier away from one area of an organisation then you must surely know where you are going to reallocate it. This portfolio has been taken away from people who have actually been doing a fairly good job over the last few months and years. During the course of the project they learnt more about it. Now it has been put on someone else's desk and is in limbo. This is a dreadful state of affairs. It is like a poor orphan. No one really cares about it; no one is really responsible for it. That is why I actually think that what sounded good in theory has not yet developed into anything worthwhile in practice. We have already been waiting for the communication for ages, and I am eager to know when it will be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above what is, of course, also in our written contributions, I should like to suggest to the Commission that it, perhaps, does not need to create so very much that is new; instead it should concentrate much more on harnessing those who are doing fantastic work on the spot. They do exist. There are networks which work incredibly well and it should use them. When I consider that you praise the Info-Points here! Well, I know of an Info-Point which is doing a great job, but which cannot survive on the money from the European Commission, which never arrives until the end of the year or the following year. Today they do not know whether they will still exist next year. How are people supposed to work there and be motivated to motivate others?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view there is much more to be done in this field. Of course, we all of us want to act in concert and to achieve the best results together but this will only work with decentralisation. You said it yourself. So let us not reinvent the wheel, but let us deploy all those who really are able to convey the concept of Europe with local colour, and not only the bit of Europe that is in Brussels!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">O'Toole (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner Monti, we all realise that we are facing a crisis in terms of our press and communications policy for the Union's institutions. Our institutions are regarded with contempt at worst and apathy at best. But if you look at the work that we actually do in the European Union, it is high-quality work of great significance to all of our citizens and has an impact on their everyday lives. Why therefore cannot that message be put across with greater alacrity and greater effectiveness, by the Commission in particular?</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, at an event in my constituency, trade unionists were taken aback at the sheer breadth of legislation that we had been able to enact, and ensured that Member States enacted, in favour of their rights. Yet that message does not seem to get through to them on a day-to-day basis and we have to ask why. I very much believe that although we are an elected House and the Commission is not, and although the Commission has one part of the policy process and we have another, we in fact have shared interests. I spend much of my time trying to destroy the myths that are growing up about the European Union and although I welcome the statement of the Commissioner, particularly on public relations and rapid rebuttal, I still feel unassisted by the Commission in what we are trying to do. I regret that it has taken until now to get a communication on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to ask why the interinstitutional talks on this issue are still stalled? I also have to ask why, when the Commission is ambitious enough – quite rightly – to want to reform the whole of European governance, it does not put at the centre of that strategy a radical reworking and modernisation of its communications and information policy. Quite honestly, we have an awfully long way to go in terms of delivering the policy that the people deserve. These questions must be answered because going forward with the White Paper on governance cannot be done in all sincerity, unless there is a commitment by the European Commission to come to terms with the problems it is experiencing within its organisation. Certainly it will have a partner in Parliament in attempting to rework the system radically.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, my party is famed for its spin-doctors. I am not necessarily advocating such a development in the European Union but we must look – and that is why I welcome your words Commissioner – at the whole question of public relations. If we are to realise the European project that we here in this room want, then we must have a voice that can sell that project and at the moment I am afraid we do not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a task which the Commission has been all too lax about. During the hearings of the new Commission in September 1999, Romano Prodi said, and I quote: “…the new Commission will be putting much more effort into communicating properly with the citizens of Europe, giving them open access to information”. I should like to have seen the President of the Commission here this evening. For now, one and a half years later, nothing has happened. Almost a year ago, the Commission promised, in its work programme for 2000, to present a strategy, but nothing has happened. This year again, the Commission has promised to do something about the matter, but rumour now has it that, when it comes to this area, there is, if anything, chaos in the organisation of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me just to point out a couple of the practical problems with the EU’s information policy, or lack of information policy. The information is too centralised, it is all prepared in Brussels and it is not directed at target groups according, for example, to gender, age, geographical considerations and the level of education of population groups. There are also some thoroughly topical and practical problems. The large Europa server on the Internet is updated too slowly and erratically, and bureaucrats can remove information from the Europa server as it suits them. There are too many bureaucratic obstacles to accessing information. EU information is now treated as a branch of the EU’s Offices for Official Publications. Is it reasonable that copies of the Official Journal of the EC which are more than three months old should have to be paid for? The Official Journal should be available free of charge on the Europa server. Too much information is only available in the EU’s main languages. Go, for example, into the Rapid database, where you will see, for example, that even Romano Prodi’s speeches are only available in two or three languages. We have eleven official languages in the EU, and all eleven must be used.</p>
<p class="contents">The key words where the EU’s information policy is concerned must be decentralisation and coordination, including in exchanges of information between the Commission and Parliament. There must be a determination to make optimum use of the information technology now available. I am very anxious to know how the Commission will get to grips with the task. I assume and hope that, as Mrs Pack also mentioned, the Commission’s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be given tasks and responsibilities, as well as means to address and inform the man or woman in the street. Commissioner, this task has now become a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Monti, you have told us that the Commission attaches great importance to information and communication policy. It may attach importance to it, but it is in absolutely no hurry, since this House has been waiting impatiently for a year and a half for the delivery of the great document on information and communication that Mr Prodi promised us. And, after a year and a half, we have been told that Parliament and the Commission will be producing this together. Frankly, Commissioner, in this area, the Commission compares very badly with a tortoise.</p>
<p class="contents">You have said that information and communication are of great importance. Mr Prodi is no doubt aware of certain image problems he has as President of the Commission, which have repercussions for the whole College of Commissioners. I suppose that he is also aware of the trends in participation in European elections over the last decade, and I suppose that he is aware of the vicious campaign being waged against the European Union and its institutions by very powerful sections of the media in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Monti, when we were told that we had to produce this document together, we got on with the job and we already have a document prepared. We have produced it in three months. Can it be that this humble Parliament has more resources, more power, more intelligence or more possibilities than the Commission? I doubt it. With whom are we supposed to negotiate politically on this issue? You said your ‘colleagues responsible for the matter. Who are they? We do not know them. We would like to know who they are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes my impatience gives way to disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the People's Europe initiative, the major European projects, such as the introduction of euro notes and coins, the reunification of Europe, the debate on fundamental rights and a European constitution, the debate on competences (who is responsible for what), the post-Nice ratification procedure and the post-Nice process – I use the expression major political European projects advisedly – need an information and communication campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the call for subsidiarity and decentralisation, the Commission and the European Parliament need to exercise joint professional management of the content. The current unsatisfactory state of affairs is the cause of the questions, criticism and disappointment about the dilettantism of the information policy, the announcement strategy and the delaying tactics. I ask myself the following questions: what has happened since 14 April 2000? Where is the master plan which we were promised at that time? Where is the specific timetable and programme of measures? Where is the clear division of responsibilities in the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 April, Commissioner Reding spoke here. A few days ago, Commissioner Barnier deferred answering the question about whether he would be taking over responsibility for this. Today you have stood in for us. Where is the proof that you are serious about a joint Commission and European Parliament approach? There is no clear strategy. We do not need a re-nationalisation of information policy. The Commission is not simply a channel for EU funds…</p>

I will, of course, relay the points made, firstly to Commissioner Reding and then to the rest of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few brief comments. In the first place, like you, ladies and gentlemen, I am absolutely convinced that Europe means more than just Brussels, and therefore decentralisation – although with a common perspective, of course, and Parliament and the Commission at the centre – is one of the key factors in the Commission's information policy lines.</p>
<p class="contents">While it would appear correct to always strive to do better, I would also like to say that, in reality, the situation is not as negative as it might seem at first sight. In the space of a few weeks, the Commission has, in fact, transferred responsibility for information policy from DG EAC to DG PRESS and also the officials who deal with it. Since 1 January 2001, DG PRESS has been responsible for managing all the budget lines related to the activities transferred from DG EAC, Heading B3-3 of the budget. The adoption of the formal Organigramme<span class="bold"> </span>for the Press and Communication Service is linked to the decision to appoint a Commissioner with responsibility conferred upon him by the President to monitor the matter. This type of appointment, which is not an easy thing for a Commission to introduce in the middle of its mandate, should be possible in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the transfer operation from DG EAC to DG PRESS involved the transfer of 104 people and EUR 90 million, dedicated to public information. Clearly, this transfer raises logistical problems, but these will be resolved by the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Representations are continuing to perform their role of informing the public, which, in actual fact, they have never ceased to do, but they are now working together with DG PRESS instead of DG EAC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Let me also make one or two observations regarding cooperation with Parliament, which we all consider to be of prime importance. Regarding shared premises, everything that could be done has been done, and more, since most of our branches now accommodate representatives of Parliament. As part of information campaigns, a tripartite Parliament, Commission and Member State body has been set up according to conventions that are now well-established, to general satisfaction. Regarding information networks, particularly the larger information centres, such as <span class="italic">Sources d'Europe</span> in Paris, or the Jacques Delors Information Centre in Lisbon, parliamentary information and visibility are ensured, even though the Commission is forced to note that Parliament has not responded to its repeated calls to become involved in the administrative structure of these centres as a fully committed partner.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, on the financial aspects, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission considers that cooperation with Parliament, while admittedly it was in need of development at the beginning of the 1990s, has now matured in a generally satisfactory manner. The diverse institutional roles of our two institutions and consequently, apart from the messages we have in common, the existence of two specific and diverse viewpoints, suggest that there may be a limit to the execution of our respective mandates. If I may, I would point out that Parliament should perhaps consider the fact that its political reservations regarding budget lines are, in fact, holding citizens’ information services hostage and not the Commission as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">May I finally make a point that I think underlies much of what has been said. Mrs O'Toole, in particular, welcomed the emphasis on public relations. We all realise that so much more has to be done. The many positive messages need to be brought more clearly and visibly to the final users, our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude with one reference to a small part of communication policy which I happen to know best because it is in my area, competition policy. Even in such an apparently technical area as competition policy we need to bring the message to the consumers. That is why, with the help and support of Parliament, we have recently initiated a six-monthly event called ‘the Competition Day’ which tries to bring out more clearly and concretely the benefits of competition policy for consumers. I can assure you that all my colleagues are working along similar lines and I hope that the overall communication on information policy to be presented by the Commission before the summer will go a long way towards meeting your concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
