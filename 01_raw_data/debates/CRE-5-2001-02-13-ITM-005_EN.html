And I believe that this is to the liking of the Europeans. To build, through this long process, a social Europe seems to me to be a great challenge and a great opportunity, which must be taken advantage of. But this construction is taking place at a specific moment, in particular economic, social and political circumstances. The Lisbon Summit decided to liberalise the telecommunications, gas, electricity and transport markets. We are experiencing a process of general globalisation and a change in the concept of industrial society and the labour market. We may ask ourselves: and what about the human factor? Both Nice and the social agenda agreed at that meeting highlight the need to count on the workers in management changes and combine the security and flexibility of economic growth with labour relations and the consequences for the social environment. And that is why, within the globalising dimension, we cannot ignore the importance of certain companies in certain regions and areas, for example the outlying regions, such as Galicia, where I come from myself, where they are the only or the main source of employment and where the threat of globalisation without guarantees would make families worried and nervous.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, economic competitiveness and a healthy society must not be contradictory terms but rather harmonious ones. Thirdly, industrial restructuring, to use the expression in a broad sense, which is perhaps acceptable and inevitable from an economic point of view, cannot ignore the social consequences of that restructuring, which must be prepared for, since the objective of Community economic policies and measures must be to achieve a high level of employment. Fourthly and lastly, national Community aid, tax incentives etc. should be conditional upon long-term temporary binding commitments in the field of employment and local and regional development. These four points are only some of the considerations that the Commission and the Council must take into account in the face of the phenomenon of industrial restructuring. Of course, the participation of the works committees, the representatives of the workers, is expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, globalisation reduces economic distances. We must commit ourselves to preventing it from increasing social differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has been said about the lack of technical adaptation and market trends, but the extent of their social consequences is never considered. Do we know how much they have contributed to the impoverishment of people and regions? Do we know how those that suffer from them recover from depression and at what cost? Do we know in what way and how much these factors contribute to the long-term unemployment of people over the age of forty? Do we know in what way and how much these factors contribute to the fact that the true retirement age in the European Union is between fifty-five and fifty-seven?</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon resolutions were designed to respond to these points by giving priority to employment, to the viability of social protection, to combating social exclusion and also by preventing changes to the economy. We do not know how much these approaches are contributing to increasing social security costs and we do not know how many people are becoming more dependent on systems of social protection. Who is it that ultimately pays for social restructuring? Is it the market or the taxpayer and the working person?</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention and fair, balanced change are impossible. The social partners say so and have even just signed a pre-agreement document in order to implement the directive on European society concerning information and consultation. Commissioner, we have also heard it said that the market is not governed by the laws of nature and that the political authorities should act by means of legislation, institutional action and social dialogue. Social insecurity and the increase in crime are becoming part of post-industrial society and affect both traditional sectors and the so-called new economy. The Portuguese, French, and now Swedish Presidencies have raised expectations by pushing ahead with dossiers that had been hitherto neglected. The Commission’s programme for 2001, however, gives no hint of these dossiers being brought to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Danone, Michelin, Aventis, Bull, Alstom, Moulinex and similar companies have shown a total disregard for the workers that they have made redundant and for the regions that may be condemned to a slow decline by the closure of a factory, and this shows the harm that these companies inflict on society.</p>
<p class="contents">We oppose the political opinions, in this House or elsewhere, that justify these criminal activities. Such opinions show that they do not in any way seek to act in the interests of society; only in the interests of the industrial and financial groups that dominate the economy and in the interests of the owners and shareholders of these groups. We also oppose those who pretend to deplore the effects of restructurings on society yet who do nothing to propose the slightest binding measure to prevent them. Apart from a complete ban on job losses upon large companies which are making a profit, all other action is mere posturing.</p>
<p class="contents">We assure those who work for these companies, and who are fighting off these attacks upon them, that they have our solidarity. They have chosen the only sensible route in this economy dominated by the law of the jungle.</p>

I too am amazed at how often it crops up. We are concerned at the tragic implications of industrial restructuring and mergers – of which the workers are all too often only informed at the last minute when all the decisions have been made – for unemployment, working conditions, the very competitiveness of Community businesses and economic cohesion, and we appeal to companies' sense of responsibility and express our sympathy, but then we do not follow the cases up.</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation does not go far enough and, what is more, in many cases it is disregarded or applied too leniently. I could produce a long list, as many Members have done, of relevant cases which we have discussed in recent years. One of the objectives set by the Lisbon Council was to achieve a high level of high quality employment. How can we achieve a Europe which is both competitive and has a high level of high quality employment? Of course, this can be accomplished by improving coordination and the play of balance between the Union's different policies, but there is no doubt that the Community legislation on the subject needs to be more effective and more stringent. Therefore, we can wait no longer – and here the Commission must assume its responsibilities – for a revision of the directive on European works councils, mass redundancies and relocation of enterprises, which does not make specific provision for a system of effective penalties for failure to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">But what really appals me – and here I refer to the Council in particular – is that it is already two years since Parliament expressed its opinion at the first reading of the only instrument which would allow us to deal effectively with these issues, the information and consultation directive, and in these two years, despite the general agreement that dialogue is the best way to deal with problems, the Council has not yet been able to summon up the courage or the strength to adopt a position on the matter. Parliament can no longer tolerate such behaviour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A little further on in the financial pages, there was the headline: “Corus experiences sharp upturn”. The contrast in the pictures – it is a shame I cannot show them to you – was almost more telling: on the front page there was a picture of a sad steelworker from Wales, and in the financial pages a graph of how the profits went up when these redundancies were announced. This sort of news is commonplace now. It confronts us with the fundamental question as to what actually motivates businesses these days. Are they only in it for the money or do they have a broader vision and mission?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, the Socio-Economic Council published two important opinions recently, one about doing business in a socially responsible manner, with the grand title: “The acquisition of values”, and the other was about corporate governance and industrial relations. In its opinions, the Council expressly opts for a broad characterisation of a business as a joint venture between various stakeholders, and so it expressly avoids focusing attention on the creation of shareholder value for the shareholders, who seem to be the main reason behind many of the restructuring operations that have recently taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no evidence of this broader perspective or these more fundamental discussions in the European debate. The European Parliament has put this issue on the agenda again today, but this discussion must also filter through into other areas of European policy. To my mind, it lacks coherence in this respect. I will cite two examples. As regards the legislation on partnerships, people argue in completely one-dimensional terms from the perspective of the shareholders. A case in point was the discussion on the thirteenth directive on takeover bids, when Mr Bolkestein well and truly dismissed Parliament’s amendments. Another example can be found in competition policy. Commissioner Monti made it abundantly clear in our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that he only wants to approach mergers from the point of view of the markets and consumers, and has little interest in the bigger picture.</p>
<p class="contents">A Green Paper on corporate social responsibility, as announced this morning, is not enough. I feel the Commission must make it its business to develop a more integrated outlook, and to ensure that this works its way through into the various policy headings. Newspapers may display a certain amount of schizophrenia, but not politicians and policy makers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certain parts of the legislative framework therefore need amending and changing. But I think that we should acknowledge the attempt being made in Europe to strike a balance between competitiveness and social cohesion. Restructuring, mergers and takeovers do indeed often have dramatic consequences. We recently saw over 5 000 jobs lost in a single month as the result of takeovers. But if we look at the competitive environment as a whole, if we look at the environment in which European companies operate, then we will realise that there would be very adverse consequences if there were no reorganisation or restructuring, if European companies did not take an active part in the business economy. And we need to calculate how many jobs are saved every time, because unless they restructure, some sectors risk disappearing altogether in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In this extremely difficult environment, there are four strands to our efforts to combine social cohesion and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is forecasting. This morning we examined how, through the Dublin Institute, we are trying to study, forecast and prepare changes. The second is the legislative and institutional framework. As you know, huge changes were made this year to legislation on the European company statute and to the five directives which follow and complete the legislative framework on the European statute, and the directive on information and consultation finally went to the Council after years of discussion between Parliament and the Commission and we achieved a majority within four months. We reckon that, with the undertakings made by the Swedish Presidency and following the Belgian Presidency, significant changes will be made to the legislative framework. I should point out here that legislation alone is not enough and that serious efforts have been made to extend controls. We are also endeavouring, in cooperation with Commissioner Monti, to check that the directives on information for workers are being properly applied during all mergers and takeovers. In addition, a committee was recently set up within this legislative framework, one of the basic subjects of which is social dialogue and the role of social dialogue in helping to ensure that mergers and restructuring proceed smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">The third strand is specific policy. The strategy on employment and the availability of money from the Social Fund mean that problems of mass redundancies can be dealt with at national level, by retraining workers, through special structures to support their reintegration into the job market or by helping them start up their own companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fourth strand is the role of companies, the social responsibility of companies. This is one of the new basic items on the social agenda; we expect workers to change, to agree to a new, flexible environment, to train, to be prepared to move from one sector to another or one place to another. But we cannot just ask workers to change their behaviour, which is why companies too have a new role in this area. We are trying very specifically to define – and the second stage will be to look at this from an institutional point of view – to define the social responsibility of companies, their responsibilities in the wake of restructuring and their responsibilities in the local area, in the society in which they operate, which is why, as we said this morning, a Commission communication will be presented at the end of June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
