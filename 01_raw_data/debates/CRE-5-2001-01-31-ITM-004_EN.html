Development must respect human dignity and the protection of the environment and health. Economic development must not disregard human rights or mutual respect for differences.</p>
<p class="contents">We all realise that Europe needs a new philosophy, namely that in order to be effective, common strategies must be realistic and practicable. Therefore, we must set ourselves clear, achievable targets so that, step by step, progress can be made towards development, security and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, a poet would say: "Woe betide the man who does not dare to dream great dreams!" but a statistician would reply: "Woe betide the politician who gets carried away on empty dreams and does not see or resolve the problems which are staring him in the face!" We have attempted to make our hopes practical and realisable in the short and medium terms. In other words, we have put forward proposals which will give all the countries of the Mediterranean the same dignity and the same opportunity for development in a new multi-faceted relationship with an increasingly large and more complex Europe, a relationship that will have to fight for its international credibility in the tough competition with the whole of the rest of the industrialised world.</p>
<p class="contents">Protecting the environment and health, dignity for workers, safeguarding the quality of products in order to protect the consumer and safeguarding a free – as long as it is fair – market, attentiveness to the specific cultural differences and traditions including architectural styles of each country and registered designation of origin products, a ban to prevent us Europeans from outrageously abusing the partnership relationships and exporting products to our partner countries which we have banned in Europe because they are dangerous, the boost for the development of all the capabilities of our Mediterranean partners, including assistance for placing the thousands and thousands of young people who have studied or trained in Europe in employment, child protection, the fight against the exploitation of minors and modern-day slavery, attentiveness to the situation of working women<span class="bold"> </span>and, in any case, to the dignity of all human beings are significant steps forward, just as Europe's commitment and endeavours to do all in its power to bring about peace and mutual respect in the Middle East must be substantial and given priority status.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be denied that, although the successive Summits were a milestone in that they pinpointed a large number of problems, they did not do anything to resolve them. Indeed, I regret to say that the governments have not implemented the proposals adopted at Barcelona: democracy, the rule of law, transparency, social rights and an internal policy to prevent communities being forced to leave their countries. A new policy of trilateral trade, safeguarding typical productions, including European productions, condemning and preventing counterfeiting and fraud, food and environmental safety, the development of craft products and the establishment of programmes to fight desertification and facilitate the conversion of non-drinking water into drinking water and the development of tourism are some of the many points which we have discussed. At this point, I would like to thank the officials of the committee and of the political groups for their work, which was particularly demanding because of the need to meet the earlier deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is now ripe to tackle practicable projects, and practicable projects are those which do not originate from specific preconceptions or concealed motives but from a policy's ability to marry the needs of the citizens with economic and social concerns. This is why Europe as a whole, not just Mediterranean Europe, to which, as an Italian, I have the honour to belong, must now recognise its strategy on the East and on the South and its commitment to these regions as absolutely essential, and confirm that if healthy, lasting progress is to be achieved, the requirements of the economy must go hand in hand with human dignity. This text was not written in order to be published as a mere declaration of intent: it was written to be implemented, and for this we place our confidence and our trust in the Commission and the Council, so that their cooperation with the European Parliament becomes practicable and updateable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Commission communication serves a dual purpose: to assess the achievements of the Barcelona Process and to put forward recommendations in preparation for the ministerial conference to be held in Marseilles in November 2000. Before proceeding to discuss the actual substance of the issue, let me first thank my fellow members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with whom I had many discussions that were extremely helpful for the final draft of my report. I should also like to say that I framed this report taking into consideration what has already been achieved in Parliament, and Parliament’s regard for the Mediterranean question, and at this point I would like to pay special tribute to the work carried out by Mr Yannis Sakellariou.</p>
<p class="contents">In its text, the Commission once again sets out the three main goals of EU-Mediterranean policy, namely: the creation of an area of peace and stability, the creation of an area of shared prosperity through the progressive establishment of free trade and, finally, the improvement of mutual understanding amongst the peoples of the region and the development of an active civil society. Mr President, of these three goals, only the establishment of a free-trade area can be deemed to have actually got off the ground. So I was pleased to hear Commissioner Barnier comment in this vein earlier, since in the midst of profound inequalities, liberalisation alone cannot bring about economic development nor the integration of deeply divided societies. This is, furthermore, a free-trade area on European terms, as may be illustrated by a single statistic: total transfers from the EU budget to the Mediterranean countries amount to EUR 1 billion per year, whilst those resulting from the Mediterranean countries’ trade deficit with the EU amount to EUR 34 million per year. In other words, the Union’s financial contribution to the Mediterranean countries represents less than one-thirtieth of the advantages which Europe derives from the free-trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the creation of an area of peace and stability, the European Union does not carry much political clout, despite the fact that in the countries of the South there is a genuine demand for Europe. There are many areas of conflict, which are liable to jeopardise the entire Barcelona Process. As to the development of an active civil society, it may be said that the people who actually benefit from the MEDA programmes are mainly those who had previous contact with Europe or who have close links with governments. Civil society has demonstrated a clear lack of interest. Finally, the programmes for decentralised cooperation, which are supposed to enable representatives of civil society from both sides of the Mediterranean to meet for the purpose of devising joint projects, have been frozen since 1995. The degree of success is rather modest, then, and the degree of frustration rather high. Many saw the Marseilles conference as a partial failure. In my view, the grand vision of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which was inaugurated in Barcelona in November 1995 has now given way to a negotiating process which lacks any genuine political will.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I attempt to present a number of proposals intended to overcome this situation. I shall now introduce the six major areas to focus on. Firstly, I think that the free-trade area must be set in the context of a proper strategic approach. Together with our Mediterranean partners, we must lay the foundations of an associate common market, capable of interacting satisfactorily with Europe’s economy, taking local parameters of development in the South into consideration. We should advocate<span class="italic"> </span>converting the planned free-trade area into a genuine ‘common market’ encompassing goods of all kinds. Secondly, migration must be placed at the very heart of development today. There will be no real partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean until the organised movement of people is put on the agenda. This is why I feel that, in coming years, migration is going to represent a crucial aspect of our relations with these countries. We need joint management of migration flows, including measures to combat illegal immigration and the mafias which profit from it. We also need to lay down policies on temporary migration, similar to what the International Labour Organisation is currently proposing, without entitlement to permanent residence. I also feel that we should introduce a special travel visa for those involved in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. We should also harness immigration to assist development in countries of origin. Immigrants contribute to the development of the country of origin. I know that the European Union and the Commission are working hard to achieve this. I would urge the Commission to go further by financing immigrants’ micro-projects. In this vein, I would also suggest setting up a monitoring centre on migration to study migration flows with a view to presenting proposals to the European Union. We must also facilitate the enhanced association of the Euro-Mediterranean states that so wish. Turning to a proposal from Commissioner Patten which I find extremely interesting, the Commissioner said that certain regional projects should be accessible to a variable number of directly interested Member States and Mediterranean partners on the basis of configurations which could vary from one project to another. I support this approach as I believe it establishes genuine, and genuinely strong, relations between the countries to the north and south of the Mediterranean who wish to go further together. My fourth point is that we also have to reform the management of the MEDA programme. The Commission tends to be critical of our Mediterranean partners. It must, however, be noted that, while it is true that some partner countries have experienced difficulties, particularly because of deficient infrastructures, the under-implementation of MEDA funds is primarily the result of the Commission’s inability to manage these funds and to rely on operators capable of implementing them properly. The defence of human rights must also be made into something more than a mere statement of principle, for the goal is actually to assist the development of constitutional states in the countries of the southern Mediterranean, and not just to create economic systems which fit into the proposed structural adjustment programmes. My sixth point is that considerable funding must be allocated. The deadlock in the Middle East peace process is an obstacle to any sub-regional dynamic, be it economic, social and/or cultural. I think the Commission should take this situation into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I shall say that the organised movement of people, codevelopment and decentralised cooperation are the main concerns behind the report I am presenting today. I think they should also be the main concerns of the Commission.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on the Barcelona Process, I would like to communicate some of the concerns and suggestions which have been unanimously approved in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I wish to draw attention to the need to promote cultural programmes, which I know is not what attention is usually drawn to. We know that the Euromed Heritage programme has been the most successful of all programmes for cooperation with the Mediterranean. Furthermore, we believe that culture promotes wealth. For example, where would Egypt be without its cultural tourism, which has been one of its main links with the world and one of its main sources of wealth? Culture, therefore, is one of the factors which is most easily accessible, closest to hand, most developed and which has accumulated the most experience in the field of Mediterranean development, which means that it can be closely linked to communication between people and can continue to open doors.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we wish to draw attention to education. We believe that if a Mediterranean trade area does not deal with the issue of education, it will become an area of Mediterranean colonisation. Therefore, the only way that there can be a social scheme capable of being incorporated into the business world and the Western world is through education. Furthermore, we believe that that is where a genuine and indigenous scheme also can be found for establishing the pillars for future development. Furthermore, the only way in which we can spread our ideas about human rights is by creating a better trained and better educated population. We are therefore not talking about clichés, but about reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that also concerns us is the way in which the Commission adapts to the philosophy and circumstances of the countries towards which the aid is directed. I believe that a large part of the failure of the MEDA programme is due to the fact that we are applying a European-scale mentality, which suits Commission projects. What we need, however, is many small projects. We need to look to the internal social structures of the countries involved, the universities, the educational institutions, the museums, the cultural field, and society itself, so that we can rely on it for future development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We played a major part in the discussion on the MEDA activity report that I presented on 5 September 2000, which was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament, as was, moreover, the amendment of the MEDA Regulation (MEDA II). We would have liked the meeting at Feira to refer to the MEDA programme, since it is the main instrument for implementing this policy and will be allocated a financial package of EUR 5.37 billion for the period 2000-2006, excluding funds from the European Investment Bank. Furthermore, we hope that this budget will be increased, as European Union Mediterranean policy should not have to suffer because of the appropriations that have been legitimately allocated to the Balkans. All the debates, regardless of the committee in which they are held, whether it be Foreign Affairs, Industry, Agriculture or Culture, or in Parliament, are unanimous in constantly reiterating the same recommendations. As far as we are concerned, we would like to stress, first of all, the need to define a Mediterranean strategy, in conjunction with third countries. Secondly, the need to develop decentralised cooperation that aims to enable contracts with local authorities and civil society, particularly NGOs, for both cross-border regions and in the South-South context, as well as for regional integration. Thirdly, we should like to highlight the decision of Parliament and the Commission to carry out an annual assessment of the human rights situation in signatory countries. My fourth point is to stress the urgent need to adopt the Charter for Security and Stability so that we can play a more active role, particularly in restoring peace in the Middle East. We consider it particularly important to encourage local measures and sustainable development, although this was omitted from the Feira Council conclusions, and to carry out progressive evaluation in this area, to implement major programmes on the environment and water, to reinvigorate the Start programme, and for third countries of the Mediterranean region to take part in the Sixth Research Framework Programme of research and technological development. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy gave its unanimous opinion on this range of questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already committed ourselves to developing a lasting partnership with North Africa, Asia Minor and the Balkan states, but we are pursuing this too slowly. It is one of the duties of Europe, which has the task of being the driving force of a balanced system of trade, the market, development, growth and economic prosperity. This is also necessary in order to stem the disturbing migration flows of this last decade, which are a clear indication of the lack of a bilateral cooperation policy. It is precisely from these last two issues that we must start if we genuinely want to restore the Mediterranean area to its former glory and, above all, to resume our leading role with political dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for Europe to be at the forefront in this geo-political scenario, using the association agreements as springboards towards the financial instruments granted by the EIB and, in particular, by the MEDA programme. At the same time, the adoption of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability, in which the two sides of the Mediterranean cooperate actively and the bases of which derive from the rights of individuals, of the family unit, of cultural diversity and of religious dialogue, cannot be put off any longer. In fact, the issue of immigration, which is one of the greatest challenges, must be tackled in respect for cultural and historical differences and itself become a means of development. It cannot be denied that the European labour requirements are constantly increasing, but, at the same time, we must put an end to illegal immigration and the numerous existing cases of illegal trafficking. Failure to establish an effective, solid barrier blocking all that works against legality or the laws of democracy can only exacerbate division, annoyance and even violence once again, which would cancel out all the effort put in and undo any progress made in dialogue thus far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore listened with great interest to Mrs Muscardini’s and Mr Naïr’s presentations of their reports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is gratifying to note that criticisms made in both reports relate to the Swedish Presidency’s main priorities. In political terms, the presidency wishes to promote democracy and human rights, social and economic progress and progress on environmental matters and, in addition, equality and the struggle against various forms of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic and financial sphere, we want to work towards an economic and financial partnership which is both dynamic and has a human face. The concept of prosperity includes both economic growth and social equilibrium. To date, no conference of trade ministers has been held within the Barcelona Process, in spite of the fact that trade and the economy form one of the three pillars of Barcelona cooperation. The presidency is therefore going to arrange a meeting involving the 27 countries’ trade ministers. The aim is to give a dynamic edge to the most important aspects of trade covered by the Barcelona Process and to agree upon the guidelines for continued work. The need for regional integration is another important issue which should be discussed. Other priority sectors include rules of origin, accumulation, harmonisation measures, norms and standards and intellectual property protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I also wish to point out that the presidency shares the view that agricultural products ought not to be excluded from the free-trade discussions. It is also important to encourage and support trade and cooperation between the partner countries themselves. This is a neglected area in which a great deal must and can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">More than five years have gone by since the Barcelona Process was embarked upon. A lot has been achieved, but it has not been possible to implement many of the plans. To some extent, the way matters stand in the peace process has restricted the potential for progress, but other factors too have had a part to play. We are convinced that a good deal can and should be done to give more impetus to Mediterranean cooperation and to make everyone involved feel that they own more of the process. I shall therefore be listening with great interest to today’s debate, which I am convinced will make a valuable contribution to strengthening the EU’s Mediterranean cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that a boost needs to be given to the political, cultural and economic aspects of the Mediterranean policy: because we must increasingly consolidate democracy and the parliamentary system, because we must expand the borders of the rule of law, because we need to realise the importance of protecting human rights, because we need cultural exchange promoting mutual awareness of societies, particularly where Islamic communities are concerned, because we need to create multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious and multicultural societies and therefore reassert the principle of respect for minority cultures as part and parcel of democracies and emphasise the importance of peace in the daily lives of the citizens of the southern side of the Mediterranean, thereby excluding from the cultural process all radical or fundamentalist behaviour and all hate, which leads to conflict, massacre and war.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover,<span class="bold"> </span>commercial interexchange is important for Europe, and it is also important to be able to provide and guarantee vocational training and adequate financial instruments, and also support and advice in respect of the currencies of these countries, for, apart from anything else, the free-trade area will then have to become a euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we expect. However, I feel that the European Union needs to do an about-turn for, in my opinion, the current line is to withdraw from the expected prospects and commitments. The cutback in the MEDA programme<span class="bold">,</span> for reasons which I see as excuses, and delays in the partnership processes are alarming. Declarations of principles have been followed not by action but by delays in action. We must prove wrong the theory that enlargement means a decline in interest in the Mediterranean. We call for decisive reversal of the trend; we also call for resolute commitment to the Mediterranean peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, and not just between these two peoples but in the entire area, to tackle the problems of the Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran, so that all this can bring peace and tranquillity to that region of the world. Let us therefore make our Mediterranean a sea of peace – for it used to be a sea of culture – where children, women and citizens can trade and move freely throughout the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napoletano (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs and point out that this debate has brought progress in Parliament's position on the issue of the Mediterranean policy, progress which is extremely important because, apart from anything else, over and above the differences between political groups, I can see that we have common ground on this matter which adds to our strength and the strength of the European institutions. The Union's Euro-Mediterranean strategy is just as important as its strategy on enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but we have outlined a path to follow for enlargement whereas we are still searching for a strategy for the Mediterranean policy, even though we have the partnership established by Barcelona behind us and despite the region's numerous problems, starting with the continual conflict. I will not dwell on this as the matter will be discussed later on when Mr Solana is here.</p>
<p class="contents">For now, I just want to say that we call for a more active, more substantial role to be played by the European governments, giving the High Representative the power to develop a policy which is not in conflict with or an alternative to the policy of the United States, but is much more substantial than the strategy currently employed by Europe with regard to the partners, whose job, I regret to say, we cannot do for them. We must therefore always bear in mind that the agreement must be based, first and foremost, on understanding and dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we cannot lose sight of other areas of conflict such as the Western Sahara. We must never forget that the United Nations exists but that, within that framework, there is room for a European initiative, and my opinion is that, at the moment, there is room for a European initiative in the Western Sahara issue and that we could put an end to this last colonial battle.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the partnership, I feel that we should tackle the more recent aspects, to which we invite the Commission and the Council to attach more importance than we have here today. I would like to focus on human rights and the rule of law. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union represented a considerable step forwards: that is, we acknowledge that the social and individual rights of all people are recognised on Union territory. This places us in a position where we can have dialogue with these countries, tackling the question of a Euro-Mediterranean citizenship where human rights issues are not a question of us interfering in their affairs but of the common need to establish values which are at the basis of the kind of peaceful coexistence we want. Similarly, with regard to immigration, I would argue that it is in both our and their interest to fight illegal immigration and therefore establish a European-scale policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture, I would point out to the Swedish Presidency that it is very easy to say that we are going to open up agriculture to free trade as well. You must realise, gentlemen, that, even now, when they are subject to duties, our products are already competitive with local products on the markets of those countries: let us therefore take care for liberalisation could destroy a sector which is of vital importance for some countries. Our Moroccan friends remind us that agriculture means keeping people in the countryside, maintaining employment and protecting the environment. Let us therefore avoid superficiality and undue haste in developing strategies on sectors where we need to progress in a partnership which does not harm these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More specifically, I would like to highlight some positive aspects which have been introduced, particularly in the field of human rights, and more especially an amendment from our group which asks for condemnation of the death penalty and a moratorium on pending executions. It would be cause for great hope if the moratorium were to take effect immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">On a different issue, I would also like to express our confidence in the impetus that the amendments provide in the regional and local field and to civil society, especially to private investment as a genuine driving force for development, over and above state aid and European aid at the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into any more detail, because I believe that the main points have been made clear by Mrs Muscardini and Mr Naïr in their speeches. However, I would like to make two observations in relation to the debates which we have held in committee and in our group. One of these concerns political priorities and the other concerns the coherence of our actions.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not all believe that we have to set the priority of enlargement towards the East against the priority of the Mediterranean. I also believe that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Lindh, made this clear the other day in committee. They are two real priorities but they are different. Enlargement is an operational priority for which we have set objectives, we know where we are going and we know what we want and, in reality, there are no alternative strategic options.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Mediterranean policy is a strategic priority, in which we do not know where we are going or, to be more precise, we are moving inexorably towards a place to which we do not want to go. The foreseeable change in income, bearing in mind current demography and economic growth, indicates that our average per capita income will rise and the average per capita income in North Africa will decrease and, unless this is prevented, the problems we all envisage, and which there is no need to mention, will increase. We know what will happen, but we do not know how to prevent it, although we want to prevent it at all costs. Let us not, therefore, set political priorities against one another.</p>
<p class="contents">My other point concerns the coherence of our actions, because, in order to get results, we must be more coherent. Clearly, we need will and we need resources, but, in fact, resources are not being used; and this means that there is insufficient capacity for management on our part, and there is insufficient capacity for absorption on the part of the receiving countries. More is requested and then is not used. Therefore, somebody should ask ‘why do we not readjust the figures?’ But what we really need is a budget and it must be used. For all these reasons I believe that we need conviction as well as the capacity for absorption.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these reports will help us to find the correct method, but quite honestly I am not convinced they will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of centralised authorities and mechanisms which thoroughly monitor the most pressing problems is essential. The management of projects on specific points and on common aspects is a need which has become a real one in relation to cases in which, on a private level, citizens and cities from both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar have been cooperating with wonderful results and without Community patronage.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purposes of this local management, it would be necessary to create a new body which, as a decentralised and permanent mechanism, would bring together all the institutional, political and social leaders of these territories which are so close and yet so far away. The 14 kilometres which separate the European Union from the Maghreb are real, but let us ensure that this does not become an insuperable distance which prevents the closest possible cooperation. Immigration, its causes and consequences – which are sometimes terrible and irreparable – business, agricultural and fishing exchanges, social, technical, educational and university exchanges, aspects of common development, such as those in the energy sector, and the essential democratising political aspects which the European Union must promote in those countries all require the creation of new mechanisms and instruments which, in a decentralised fashion, would respond to these needs, which are local but which have widespread repercussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What yesterday were laudable ambitions, such as calls for an area of shared prosperity, for a balancing of North and South, a commitment to enhancing peace and stability, are now urgent issues. While we all see the need to relaunch the partnership, there is, however, a divergence in the options we favour. The future of the very concept of a partnership lies not in adjusting the needs of these populations to the market forces at work in the North and to our personal ambitions, but instead in ensuring their own development and resolving their urgent issues. I believe, therefore, that Europe should adopt some approach other than simply supporting these countries in establishing the free-trade area that Europe was to set up. Enabling cooperation agreements, particularly through public services, seeking other financial resources, by introducing a Tobin-style tax, for example, and reducing or even writing off debt would give real substance to a fair and useful partnership. This approach would favour North-South relations without the element of domination. The same applies to human rights. Our associations with countries in the Mediterranean region can only be built on trust. We are, therefore, extremely concerned about human rights violations in Tunisia, for example, because the agreements signed by both parties oblige them to respect human rights. The same applies to the European Union’s respect for the rights of all citizens. I am thinking here of the need for a more integrated and more generous approach to migration. It is inhuman and ineffective to advocate the free movement of goods and capital but not of people. Experience shows that closing borders serves only to force immigrants with no identity papers and no rights into the hands of smugglers and other unscrupulous dealers.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we speak of managing immigration in a more humane manner, how can we hope and pray for further integration, if we do not question its foundations? We must safeguard the freedom of movement of persons and equality in social, economic, cultural and political rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, in order to create an area of peace in the Middle East, the European Union needs to take much more direct and resolute action. From now on, the United Nations resolutions must be applied in full, Israel must respect its commitments and we must recognise the Palestinians’ legitimate right to their own state. The same problem – I am about to finish – can be seen in the Western Sahara, where there is a risk that armed conflict will be resumed.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all this, the European Union has everything to gain by bringing together all parties, such as associations, local authorities and unions, who are already establishing a different form of partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At long last, it puts the problem of common foreign policy back in its natural context, by which I mean the geographical context, i.e. physical space, the confrontation of land and sea, the grouping of nations in terms of their own areas of activity, their own bonds and their own community of interests, even if these are focused away from those of the mythical Europe, a continent so intangible that it does not have any real borders.</p>

As I mentioned, geographical position is the repository or sanctuary, if you prefer, or, in other words, the narrative which enables us to read, understand and hence respect the invariable political factors that are dictated by geography. This shows, moreover, just how problematic, if not, as we might more accurately say, impossible, it is to implement a common foreign policy through pathetic puppets such as Solana. Yet, the way that political Europe currently operates automatically rules out the geo-political approach since, as there is no definition of what constitutes Europe’s common interest – by which I mean a European <span class="italic">res publica</span> – it still favours, after all the usual free-for-alls, the law of the jungle, allowing the strongest at any given time to make the rest of the 15 support its strategic choices, even if it has to shove them down their throats. We therefore come to understand that, in this game, the upper hand on Mediterranean policy, as well as on many other subjects, is held by northern Europe – i.e. Great Britain plus Germany and its age-old allies. That is why priority has clearly been given to enlargement to the north and to the east including the Balkans, where we are paying the price of German policy, while our friends in the Mediterranean region bear the costs of every adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the rapporteur and my good friend, Mr Naïr, are both justified in denouncing Europe’s lack of commitment to the Mediterranean region and Middle Eastern affairs. I would just like to add that all the Latin countries may sooner or later reject, perhaps even violently reject the prospect of a future which relegates them to the sidelines of a group over which they no longer have any influence. Even today, we believe that it is the duty of the southern European nations, or rather the northern Mediterranean nations, to work together with the southern Mediterranean countries, firstly, the three Maghreb countries, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, to create this area of solidarity, which is a part of our history and geography and that is, moreover, of importance to us in the century that is just beginning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Financially, we simply lack the resources to do an awful lot and what is more, the European Union’s external relations have been such that we cannot afford to be overly confident. It is high time we established priorities, thus allowing us to do the things we do outside the Union well.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent statements made by Mr Solana confirm the need to prioritise. He referred to the Union’s strategy documents, including those with regard to the Mediterranean countries, as purely bureaucratic exercises. Ideas on paper hardly ever turn into reality in practice. However, the endless recitals and paragraphs in the documents before us do raise expectations among our partners, expectations which we cannot possibly fulfil, because we also have other responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Both reports are disparaging about those other responsibilities. According to the rapporteurs, our relationship with candidate countries, in particular, has led to the neglect of the southern countries, and that must now be put right. However, I do not agree with this line of thought. Enlargement deserves all our attention in the near future. If we want to do this properly, we will have our hands full. There is therefore certainly no chance of spending as much money on our southerly neighbours, certainly not if we bear in mind how reluctant Member States are to put more money into the Union’s fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, both reports take an optimistic view of the Union’s influence in the political arena. We should not be under any illusions, particularly when it comes to the role which the European Union could play in the Middle-East peace process. I regret that both reports run the risk of not being taken seriously due to unrealistic goals. Indeed, the European Union could very well be of significance, especially in the economic sense, but also when it comes to the problem of refugees. We should only concern ourselves with matters where the European Union can provide added value and can really be of significance. Being modest as to in our abilities will enhance the quality of the European Union’s external relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just a political, but also a historical commitment we must make. Needless to say, the EU’s activities with regard to securing peace in the Mediterranean, especially in relation to the centre of conflict in the Middle East, constitute a special responsibility, which, sadly, the representatives and members of the European Union, and particularly their foreign policy representatives, have been unequal to in the past. However, the pursuit of an autonomous and active European peace policy must remain one of the EU’s goals.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, there are also other reasons besides the security aspects, as to why it is important for the EU to play a more active role in the Mediterranean region. The EU cannot, nor should it, spare any expense in the social and cultural spheres, in supporting democratic developments, in intervening in the event of human rights violations, in promoting economic development, and in improving dialogue and cooperation in as many areas as possible, if it wants to see discernible progress. If we are to avoid all these proposals, as detailed in the report, remaining no more than declarations of intent, we will need to work on the list of priorities, which has also been called for in this House, and which sets out in precise terms the order in which these intentions are to be carried out and the financing thereof. Incidentally, my tone was not one of regret when I mentioned our former access to the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Examples of this are the migration flows in our direction, the deterioration of our environment and the dangers presented to our society by radical fundamentalism. In summary, balance on our southern border is essential to our stability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important that we share the view that the Union’s natural desire for enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe must not lead to a deterioration of its policy towards the Mediterranean. Therefore, while in 1995 my group supported and strongly promoted the open process in Barcelona which, at last, after almost 40 years, drew up a global strategy for the Community countries in relation to the Mediterranean countries, it now supports the objective contained in the reports which we are debating today to strengthen the Barcelona Process.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, in relation to Mr Naïr’s report, we have tried to improve it in committee by means of various contributions and I would like to thank the rapporteur for being receptive towards them. We have insisted on the importance of strengthening interparliamentary dialogue, which must be consolidated as one of the key elements in boosting the Barcelona Process. We would like to point out that we should promote the liberalisation of the economic systems of our Mediterranean partners and carry out the structural changes necessary to compete in more open markets. We have proposed the creation of a monitoring centre for migration flows, responsible amongst other things for creating mechanisms to combat, in a coordinated fashion, the mafias which profit from illegal immigration. We would like to point out that relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries are based on a global strategy, one of the elements of which is undoubtedly fishing, and therefore we trust that the Moroccan Government will adopt an attitude which reflects the current urgency in the negotiations which are taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we would like to point out to the Commission that, within the framework of the reforms taking place in its external service, the human resources dedicated to the Mediterranean association need to be reinforced, a specific structure needs to be established in the Commission, and progress needs to be made on the devolution and decentralisation of aid. In summary, my group is in favour of the European Union playing a broader role in the Mediterranean and we hope that human and material resources are provided that are a match for the challenges facing us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Mediterranean provides a dramatic example of the issue of war and peace. The issue of North-South relations is spectacularly alive in the Mediterranean. The very fashionable issue of the clash of cultures or dialogue between cultures is symbolised by the Mediterranean. The emergence of xenophobia and racism, or tolerance and multiculturalism, is most intensely illustrated in the Mediterranean. The question of democracy and human rights or authoritarianism is alive in the Mediterranean and will continue to be so in the coming years. The issue of regional responses to the challenges of globalisation is being raised in the Mediterranean. The issue of women’s emancipation or repression is also at its most intense in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to insist therefore that this is our fundamental priority, because the prospects for its future remain completely open, while enlargement will take time, it will have its costs and its problems, but the only reasonable outcome that anyone can imagine is that it will eventually take place.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Mediterranean, a ‘sandbelt’ or a ‘slumbelt’ may be created in the twenty-first century, and both issues are dramatically highlighted. The two contributions presented here today, in the European Parliament, are contributions to the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean policy. I believe that Mr Patten and Mr Solana would do very well to read these reports, and in particular, the report by my friend and teacher, Sami Naïr, because it makes a very coherent and well put together list of themes, which calls for a political proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy was well defined in Barcelona five years ago but today it needs not only a new expression of will but also the ability to implement initiatives. We must achieve – above all in the Mediterranean, and we Mediterraneans know this – something very important: things need to be explained. Nevertheless, if anything is lacking today, it is symbolic specific action, a strong signal that the Union, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, are truly interested in this relaunch, which goes beyond words and speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to draw attention to an aspect of Sami Naïr’s report: the need to create strong initiatives in the fields of South-South trade and for subregional integration or integration in the southern Mediterranean region. We need something strong. I do not know exactly what it may be, but it must truly win over public opinion in the South so that people can see that the European Union clearly has, as well as a well drawn-up policy, the will to create banking and financial instruments, railways that lead to subregional integration in the South or networks of roads and motorways. This message must make a genuine contribution to this renewal of the will for integration which, above all in the Maghreb, is a cause for hope at the moment<span class="bold"> </span>and which must count on an ambitious and also generous contribution from the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to start from this consideration: the European Union's strategy for the Mediterranean, developed at Feira, in addition to failing to provide practical recommendations,<span class="bold"> </span>does not take into account certain developments which have taken place in recent years in the Mediterranean Basin. After centuries of struggling and marginalisation it has resumed a key position in world trade again, which, after the discovery of America, had been dominated by the Atlantic routes. Thanks also to the new production boost in Asia, Europe now trades more with Asia than with America. For these trade routes between America and Asia, the Mediterranean provides a valuable centre for unloading goods for northern Europe, which means that carriers do not have to make detours. This is thus a new development which the European Union cannot ignore and which has already yielded the first, astonishing results. And it is towards this integrated, well-structured system that we must endeavour to direct our funds, a system which is already equipped with transport intermodality in the form of aircraft, railways and motorways. Without this practical step, the funds will frequently not be exploited, as is the case at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What were the objectives of that partnership? They are, once again, the creation of an area of peace, the improvement of mutual understanding amongst the peoples of the region and the creation of an area of shared prosperity. The first two goals have not been achieved, as Mr Naïr has said. Unfortunately, this is true. We have not created an area of shared prosperity either, only the very beginnings of a free-trade area involving some of the countries, established on European terms, because the main beneficiaries of these are the industrial products in which we have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am continually surprised, moreover, that those who are the quickest to call for an extension of a free-trade area, imposing the liberal model on terms that are extremely unfavourable for the countries of the South, are also the first to speak of interference, even neo-colonialism, with regard to human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In Barcelona, the vital contribution of civil society to the development of partnerships was recognised for the first time in a text to which the European Union and 15 countries of the southern Mediterranean subscribed. We must admit that we have failed spectacularly on this issue. We have been unable to support the dynamic efforts of citizens and democratic projects, in the face of the hard line adopted by most governments, but is this from lack of any real will to do so? How can we use the association agreements and the MEDA programme to support them? What sort of effective strategy and what set of relevant measures can we create in order to avoid this schizoid situation where what we say and what we do are two quite different things? Do we really wish to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, or would we rather condemn ourselves to the Europe of the Fifteen’s continuing to pursue relations in the same traditional mould as some self-styled ‘realistic’ states? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Naïr rightly said, the European Union only appears to be interested in the Mediterranean for reasons of security and only intervenes economically in order to gain a foothold on the markets in the southern countries. The new common strategy goes even further in the same direction; it even tries to involve the Mediterranean countries in the aggressive CFSP. Euro-Mediterranean collaboration is the main vehicle for interference in the internal affairs of the Mediterranean countries, and, ostensibly, all this is being done in the name of common prosperity, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union remains resolutely indifferent to the tragedy of the Palestinian people and the murder of Palestinians by the state of Israel on a daily basis. The Communist Party of Greece defends collaboration between people on equal terms and without one country's interfering in the internal affairs of another. In particular, we would point out that it is the developed capitalist countries which are responsible for the current state of the underdeveloped countries. That is yet another reason why the developed countries are duty bound to help these countries develop their productive base and raise the standard of living of their inhabitants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, no longer necessary to remind the House of the role, the function and the importance of the Mediterranean in the very origins of European culture and the way that it is both the cradle and the vehicle of our civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot ignore the fact that, thus far, our joint action in this major geographical area has not been effective and has certainly not been exhaustive. Poorly managed programmes, maladministration, even a certain lack of clear thinking and political timeliness have prevented us from making what is – I am sure – the will of our institutions a practical reality, that is from achieving the three objectives focused on at Barcelona: an area of peace and stability, an area of shared prosperity through free trade and greater understanding between peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member of the Committee on Budgets, I can only hope that the Commission will be willing to change the way it runs the MEDA programme and the very structure of the programme, in the manner indicated by Mr Bourlanges, that is, basing its approach on radical streamlining of the cycle of procedures, greater recourse to macrofinancial support, and less complex commitology. The Commission, which is already presenting the initial draft budget, also needs to endeavour to be more transparent by producing an annual document highlighting the expenditure commitments which can be made for each country.

A system based on partnership with the same rights and obligations is supposed to emerge from a colonial and a post-colonial system. Seen from a historical perspective, the ruling structures were always constructed in such a way as to produce a North-South divide, and now it is only right that Europe, whose countries – or rather, certain European States from within this system – were almost always the beneficiaries, should also take responsibility for rapprochement and parity, and should promote these aspects too.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of the Barcelona Process is undisputed. Its success depends not only on formal negotiated outcomes, but also on the extent to which we are able to dispel the prejudices we ourselves harbour towards the Mediterranean States and their inhabitants. There can be no doubt that the realisation of the Barcelona objectives will prove decisive to a peace strategy of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, it is important to ensure that no Mediterranean country is excluded. Libya, the country that lies almost exactly at the heart of the Mediterranean States, goes unmentioned in the Barcelona paper. The process of rapprochement will not work unless the EU endeavours to invite Libya to take part in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have already been mentioned in the debate: from illegal immigration to droughts, from external debt to the failure to respect human rights, and terrorism, which ruthlessly destroys the lives of innocent human beings and families, as we are seeing in Spain, in Algeria and in the Middle East itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Today more than ever we must make the statement that only cooperation, dialogue, economic and cultural exchanges, solidarity and mutual understanding can turn the two sides of the Mediterranean into a prosperous and peaceful area. Neither the European Union nor the Maghreb or Mashreq countries can afford not to take advantage of the human and cultural resources that enrich the region. The problem is that we are not doing that properly. The association agreements are dead letters in many respects. The financial instruments are not being used as they should and the political, economic and social development of those countries is not keeping up with the pace of horizontal cooperation, which is very necessary, nor with the modernity required today by a world which, technologically speaking, is taking giant steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to move from contemplation to action, to demand performance and effectiveness in the efforts to implement the strategy which has been drawn up and, in this respect, I would like to emphasise the demand for human resources to be strengthened, as indicated by Mr Galeote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That being the case, instead of elaborating on these two reports, I should like to say a few words to corroborate the arguments behind them.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, we had a entire debate because the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, said that European history dates from the time of Charlemagne. The very name Europe which, as Europeans, we all bear, derives from the name Europa, the daughter of Libya and Poseidon, the God of the Sea. Europa was Zeus's wife, the mother of Minos, Sarpedon and Radamanthe. Why am I telling you all this? Because mythology itself, which is a narrative record of history, highlights the relations which exist between Europe and North Africa. The Mediterranean is, to all intents and purposes, the only European sea, and as long as we, in our plans and policies, look down on the other side of the Mediterranean from on high, then we shall get nowhere. We need to get a few things straight. If, in the twenty-first century, we try and base policies on the attempt by certain European countries to find traces of the recent colonialism to lean on then, politically, Europe will get nowhere. We must realise that the starting point for today's debate, based on the two reports, based on the decisions taken in Barcelona, is to see the other side of the Mediterranean as part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union itself must take initiatives – development, cultural and, most importantly, peace initiatives – so that the two sides of Europe can stand opposite each other without our again hearing echoes of "<span class="italic">Hannibal ante portas</span>" or "<span class="italic">Delenda est Carthago</span>" or a modern version of Scipio. There are Europeans on the other side of the Mediterranean and we would do well to remember that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, the outcome was meagre, which is very disappointing. There was too much gesture politics going on and too little capacity to carry out the plans. Three quarters of the committed funding never left the kitty. Instead of a reduction in the means, this will now lead to an increase, which is a little bizarre, to say the least. It makes no sense to budget for even higher amounts if the absorption capacity remains restricted and the Commission delegations are understaffed.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be far more preferable if the European Union were to show its solidarity with the Mediterranean countries by opening up its markets more, not only for products from industry, but also for those from agriculture and horticulture. We have a very long way to go before a free-trade area is established.</p>
<p class="contents">The economies of the partner countries are still very vulnerable. Their mutual trade is still being restricted and has protectionism written all over it. Additionally, the political distrust which exists between the partners must first be dispelled.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Process can only succeed if the Mediterranean partners continue to work on democratisation. The human rights clauses in the Association Agreements should not remain hollow phrases. Any violations should be penalised by a drop in financial support. But if we reduce the amounts which cannot be spent anyway, then this will not make any impact whatsoever. We must bring our ambitions into line with the degree to which they can be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether the report’s many sound wishes can all be realised at the same time. It is better to do one thing which is slightly inferior than to do a great deal of things which are downright inferior. Fine words and fine budgets are not enough to guarantee stability and welfare. It is about the willingness to carry out true political reform, and this is what the Barcelona Process still lacks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legacy of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome shaped our culture, our literature, our very understanding of the common European heritage. Around the Mediterranean the three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity, Islam – were founded and fostered and spread throughout the known world. Our debt to the Mediterranean is not only historical and cultural, it informs our common interest today in enlargement. It is true that covers mainly countries from Central and Eastern Europe, but the candidate countries include the two famous Mediterranean island peoples: the Maltese and the Cypriots.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the Mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be seen as complementary and not conflicting. It is suitable that today the presidency should be manned by Mr Danielsson from Nordic Europe. An example of North-South solidarity was when Prime Minister Aznar attended the Gdansk commemoration celebrating the foundation of the Solidarnosc movement. I hope that improved relations between the EU and North Africa may result from the Mediterranean programme. Today we wait for the outcome of the Lockerbie trial from a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but I understand it is the intention of the British to foster, in future, better diplomatic and other relations with, for example, Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question for the Council. Could Mr Danielsson confirm that the EU’s Mediterranean programme is coordinated with the enlargement process to which the presidency attaches so much importance? I wonder if it might be possible for the Commissioner in his reply to dwell on the criticisms of underspending sometimes levelled at the MEDA programme. Is it the case that the Commission stands ready when necessary to give administrative support in the formulation of suitable programmes, as they did in the past when I wrote a report on the Alfama and Mouraria areas of Lisbon? Is it the case that, if there were to be underspending, the money could be relocated?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning paragraph 54 of the Naïr report, could the Commissioner also confirm that the two Mediterranean candidate countries might be able to participate in the Euromed Heritage programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These three points should guide us in our relations with our Mediterranean partners. It was in this spirit that the Group of the Party of European Socialists collaborated with the rapporteurs, Mrs Morgantini and our friend, Mr Naïr. For we must now set priorities that have genuine measurable objectives and we must allocate adequate resources to achieving them. We know that these priorities are, first of all, to make progress along the difficult road that is the Charter for Peace and Stability. The French Presidency tried to do this against an extremely complicated background and the Swedish Presidency, I am sure, will continue along this route. We would hope so and we shall all keep an eye on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Process should not be held hostage to the Middle East peace process. Quite the opposite; the continuing tensions and the state of war between the Israeli and Palestinian people serve only to highlight the current need to improve dialogue between the countries bordering the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also step up the negotiation, ratification and implementation of the association agreements, since this contract formalises the commitments of both parties and ensures an effective partnership. We are delighted to learn that an agreement has just been signed with Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we cannot continue investing just one euro in the South for every 10 we invest in the East. This imbalance becomes more explosive with every passing day. Firstly, of course, we must bring the reform of the MEDA financial instrument to a successful conclusion so as to improve the quality and speed of its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we call for decentralised cooperation to be relaunched on new bases, so that we can fulfil the hopes and respond to the profusion of initiatives from civil society, both European and Mediterranean, because the partnership will be worth nothing if it is not a partnership of peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I was interested to note that the Swedish Presidency intends to focus on the cultural, social and human aspects of the Mediterranean partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our relationship with the South needs the input of more than just words and political symbols. Our partners are expecting practical steps to be taken, as Mr Naïr stressed in his report, which I thought was particularly valuable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, it is undeniably a fundamental part of European policy. I hope that the same will become true of Mediterranean policy as of today, not only because the Middle East is one of the most insecure areas on our borders or because the southern side of the Mediterranean is the greatest source of migration towards Europe, but also, I am glad to say, because, as President Prodi recently stated, having already discovered America we have now discovered Asia, and the Mediterranean has resumed its key position in world trade and exchange which must be exploited on both northern and southern sides.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, if this is true the performance of the MEDA programme cannot be taken as the benchmark, although I am convinced that careful evaluation of its results would shed a different light on things, but there are three lines to be explored: firstly, increasing mutual understanding through decentralised cooperation, which can be strongly encouraged; secondly, a training programme for the ruling classes of the Mediterranean, which Europe must involve in order to guarantee itself a better future; thirdly, defining sustainable sea transport policies in the Mediterranean, which will become a central point either of danger or of major development for both northern and southern sides of the Basin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The past year has not lived up to these expectations. Admittedly, it was possible to hold another Euro-Mediterranean conference during the French Presidency, but this meeting produced few decisions and, above all, no genuine strategy. Furthermore, I believe that it is time to give our Mediterranean strategy a firm foundation and to dissociate it from the vicissitudes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the European Union will achieve its goal of strengthening economic, political and cultural ties with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall soon be discussing the partnership agreement between the European Union and Egypt. I am delighted that this agreement was finally signed last week. As the rapporteur on Egypt, I sincerely hope that we can take this opportunity to encourage the other partners who have not yet signed up to an agreement to do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth considering the European Parliament’s role in this process, which is still too limited. Then perhaps we might be able to shape the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum on the model of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which meets twice yearly and can set up working parties and initiate fact-finding missions. We could also, perhaps, improve the organisation of Parliament’s regular participation in ministerial meetings between the Barcelona Process members.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission to explicitly recognise the role of towns and large cities, and I should like to thank Mr Naïr, the rapporteur, for agreeing to table an amendment that I made to his excellent report. The Mediterranean countries should be encouraged to develop their relations and to share their experiences on specific urban issues. The problems of modern times are most serious within towns and large cities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all convinced that the future of the Union's Mediterranean strategy depends largely on the success of the Middle East peace policy, which we must be more zealous in supporting even though it is the United States which is at the forefront of this political initiative. The success of the Euro-Mediterranean project and the concrete results of economic cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the area should benefit the peace policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, eastwards enlargement, which received fresh impetus from the Nice Summit, must go hand in hand with an equally strong boost for the Mediterranean strategy, which has to evolve.</p>
<p class="contents">Another boost, including financial support, is therefore needed for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA programmes, particularly the programmes targeting professional training, university exchanges, projects promoting cooperation with the Union's research centres and technology parks, and especially with the cities and regions of Mediterranean Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social progress must also lead to the consolidation of the areas of democracy, but, as has already been stressed, we must not lose sight of the fact that full respect for human rights is essential if the partnership is genuinely to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to start my speech by informing Parliament – I believe this is good news – about the MEDA programme, with which perhaps some of you are already familiar. On 12 December the Council approved a budgetary contribution in this regard, which represents an increase of 10% on the annual investment for the MEDA programme. This means that, compared to the EUR 684 million used during the previous period, that annual contribution will now total EUR 764 million per year. I believe that this demonstrates the goodwill that dominates relations between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and unfortunately – we must note, however, that sufficient means are not being made available to find an appropriate destination for this aid, since, in the period 1995-1999, almost 30% of the budgeted aid was not implemented. This is disappointing management. I do not know what the problem is, but there is a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to refer to the social, cultural and human dimension of these 15 North African countries, to which our various societies must move closer, and with whom we must promote comprehension and improve mutual understanding. It also requires a special effort in terms of the teaching and training of young people, which must be based on tolerance, since young people are the future of these nations. Neither must we forget dialogue, as well as the promotion of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say one thing: we have an obligation to do this well, because if we do not do it out of love, we will have to do it out of fear, because what is at stake is the security of southern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this debate. I have listened carefully to the points of view presented and noted that the criticisms made on a number of points are justified. I think that dialogue with the partner countries is extremely important. The real potential of the Barcelona Process can only be realised if all participants feel that they really own the process and that they are responsible for its different parts.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment briefly on some of the interesting contributions to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Beazley discusses the issue of whether the enlargement process and Mediterranean cooperation are coordinated processes. The obvious answer from the presidency is <span class="italic">yes</span>; they must be coordinated. Just like Mr Esteve, we too, as holders of the presidency, see no conflict between, on the one hand, enlargement and, on the other hand, Mediterranean cooperation. We shall, and must, be able to devote all our energies to these two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that a number of MEPs, particularly Mrs Carlotti and Mr Martin, discuss the importance of association agreements between the EU and the partner countries. We see these agreements as necessary building blocks for establishing a free-trade area in the region. The aim is for these agreements to be ready by 2010. That is why, in the Council’s view, it is important for this process to be speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that it was possible to countersign the association agreement with Egypt a few days ago. We hope that, during the Swedish Presidency, we shall be able to hold an initial association council with Jordan. It is also promising that the association negotiations with Algeria, Syria and Lebanon are proceeding at a good pace. We believe, then, that these association agreements are not only of great importance to trade and economic integration but are also an important political platform. They form the basis for a regular, deeper and extended political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s debate, quite a lot of criticism has been directed against the EU’s aid to the Mediterranean. The Council hopes that the revised mediation arrangement adopted last autumn may provide the opportunity for a more efficient and more strategic method of working. Mr Martin spoke of the importance of the cities’ role in Mediterranean cooperation. I can only concur with what Mr Martin said. It is important to give due weight to the significance of the urban regions and their potential in Mediterranean cooperation. The Council therefore sees this as an aspect we should like to try to cultivate further.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gemelli spoke about what I think is a very important issue, namely the dialogue with Islamic society. At the social and cultural level, the presidency sees just such a dialogue between cultures and civilisations as one of our most important priorities – an area in which, as luck would have it, Sweden has been able to play quite a leading role for a long time. Mention might be made, for example, of the so-called Euro-Islam project and the so-called Stockholm Conclusions from 1998, which provide guidelines for continued work in a long list of areas within this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Napoletano discussed the incredibly important cooperation taking place in the legal sphere. The Swedish Presidency wishes to promote cooperation in this area. We shall be organising a high-level meeting and a seminar. Both will be designed to contribute to the Commission’s new regional programmes in the legal and domestic policy areas. Questions relating to migration, to which several MEPs have referred in today’s debate, are an important part of this complex of issues. I think it is important for these migration issues to be seen in an overall perspective in which we have to take account of social, economic and cultural aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The phase we are now entering into must be focused upon implementing what everyone within the Barcelona Process has already agreed about. I believe it was Mr Obiols I Germà who talked about the lack of symbolic specific action. Mrs Carlotti touched upon the same subject. I now believe that the EU, together with the partner countries around the Mediterranean, must ensure that the intentions and commitments of the Barcelona Declaration are ‘clothed’ in action for, like any other activity, the Barcelona Process will be judged not according to what it promises but according to what it achieves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, it gives me very great pleasure to participate in this debate on the Mediterranean today. I am particularly grateful to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Naïr, for the excellent work that they have done in preparing their two reports. It has been an extremely good debate. It is personally rather a disappointment that many of those who were able to find time in their busy diaries to take part in the debate were not able to find time to hear very much of the debate or even to wait until the end to hear the responses. It is, I guess, a sort of discourtesy on my part to reply to people who ask serious questions but who are not able to stay to hear the response, so I will not do that. I will just respond to people who have been able to stay until the end, which in fact gives the debate some meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is our near abroad, on our southern flank, so it should enjoy a very special place in our external relations. The objectives agreed at Barcelona remain fundamentally valid and they are increasingly relevant: working together for peace and stability, creating shared prosperity through establishing free trade, providing the economic and financial assistance to meet the challenges which that implies, and helping to improve mutual understanding and tolerance among peoples of different cultures and different traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, I had long believed that the time had come to see how we could improve the delivery of the Barcelona objectives. We therefore worked very hard on a Commission communication on reinvigorating the Barcelona Process, which in turn provided the main input for the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Marseilles last November where our ideas were overwhelmingly endorsed. That document was on the table, that document was the principle agenda for that meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like now to give you my assessment of where we stand and where we should go from here. With the permission of the House, I will address points arising from both reports in this context rather than dealing with each report separately.</p>
<p class="contents">First, let me look at the political situation in the region, which we are going to debate in a few moments’ time. Both reports note the considerable significance of the Middle East peace process for European Union policy in the Mediterranean. I note the calls in both reports for the European Union to play a more active role in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not underestimate our contribution. We are, for example, and it is not an unreasonable point to make, the major donor to the Palestinian Authority. Last year EUR 155.6 million was earmarked from the Community budget, which included EUR 90 million for a special cash facility that I made available at the end of the year to help preserve the institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority, which we have helped to create and fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, without reservation, to thank the House – to thank this part of the budgetary authority – and also to thank the Council for their assistance in ensuring that we could make that cash facility available before Christmas. As events have sadly proved, it is going to be all too necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting in Marseilles, ministers decided, rightly in my view, not to seek agreement on the proposed Charter for Peace and Stability. This was clearly not the right moment. Nevertheless, in substance a good deal of progress had been made towards agreement on this instrument. We should make sure that we can capitalise on that progress when the time is right, so that it becomes a genuinely meaningful document, reflecting the European Union’s active commitment to maintaining regional peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime – and here I also echo comments made in both the reports that we are considering – we should not wait for the charter to be in force to make more efforts to promote respect for human rights and democratic freedoms in the region. Our communication is unequivocal on this subject. The European Union should use all appropriate fora to press for progress on these issues. The MEDA democracy programme should continue to be used to fund positive actions and MEDA allocations themselves should be more dependent on adequate progress. I very much welcome Parliament’s backing on this and I hope that the Council will also react positively.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and financial matters are, of course, at the heart of the partnership though they are not, as several speakers pointed out, anything like the whole of that partnership. In Marseilles there was a high level of consensus on our proposals for reinvigorating it and I would like to highlight the following: we must speed up the negotiation, signature and ratification of the association agreements. I am happy to confirm that we are achieving considerable progress on this. On Friday last week we managed, at last, to initial the agreement with Egypt and we are encouraged by the progress we are making with Algeria, with Lebanon and with Syria. I want to see negotiations with Algeria, Lebanon and Syria pursued vigorously this year, however the ratification process in the Member States is lamentably slow. The agreement with Jordan was signed three years ago, but it is still not in force. Help from the European Parliament in this respect would be most welcome. I do hope that, as well as making speeches in the Chamber, honourable Members will get on to their own parliaments and governments to ensure that when we reach agreement on one of these associations agreements it can be ratified rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two states which still have not ratified the Jordan agreement – no names, as they say, no pack drill – but I very much hope that Belgian and French MEPs – I hope I have not given the game away – will get on to their parliaments to press for ratification as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In due course we also need to tackle the issue of agricultural trade. The credibility of our partnership lies in being able to deal with sensitive matters like that and we need to have a genuine discussion. We must develop South-South trade and cooperation, including on a subregional basis. We want all countries signing an association agreement with us to conclude free-trade agreements among themselves within five years. This is the only manner to prepare our already agreed objective of an overall European-Union-Mediterranean free-trade area by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of subregional trade needs to be accompanied by greater subregional cooperation. Trading opportunities will not be used unless the infrastructure is there. We must introduce accumulation of origin for all partners establishing free trade between themselves and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin. We must harmonise measures relating to the single market. We want a timetable to be in place by next year for priority sectors – such as rules of origin, customs, norms and standards, and intellectual property protection – for implementation starting in 2004, both between the partners and the Union and among the partners themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, together with the support we give to our partners under MEDA, will increase the attractiveness of the region to investors. A decompartmentalised and open market with a sound and predictable legal and administrative environment is the best way to ensure that the very low levels of local, European and world-wide investment will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Both reports rightly pay much attention to the need to improve MEDA, which one or two of the speakers who are still present in the Chamber mentioned during their remarks. Indeed, MEDA has an excellent record on commitments but is much less good on payments. Last year the record on commitments was maintained: the provisional figures show that EUR 879 million or 98% of available commitments were executed and the record on payments improved to EUR 335 million or 95% of available appropriations. I am happy to say that the control of the overhang of payments required to execute the commitments has begun to improve. As an average over the last five years, we have now paid 30% of existing commitments, compared to 26% one year ago, but there is still a long way to go. We are in the process of implementing two reforms, the revised MEDA regulation and the internal Commission reform. Taken together, I am confident that they will bring about serious improvements in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr honourable friend, Mr Beazley, who I am delighted to say is still in his place, spoke about that and asked a specific question about Cyprus and Malta and their participation in regional programmes. I am delighted to answer “yes” – in the affirmative. It is a positive “yes” rather than negative or equivocal “yes”.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the opinion that the amount made available for the period 2000 to 2006 is insufficient. I was not surprised to see that mentioned in the report. It is certainly true that the EUR 5.35 billion agreed by the Council – I give away no secrets – is less than the Commission had proposed. Nevertheless, together with EIB lending, this means that nearly EUR 13 billion will be available over that period, which is not an insignificant amount of money. The important thing now is to see that this money is used effectively in terms both of the quality of our actions in relation to the policy objectives and of actual payments on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed that, for the future, MEDA allocation should be more closely linked to the association process and the implementation of economic reforms. I make no apology for this and I am glad to note support for this line in one of the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the calls to increase the numbers of Commission staff available to work on this sector. I recognise that the staff concerned are extremely hard pressed, but any decisions will have to be taken in the context of the evolution of Commission staffing levels overall and here again I would be delighted for concrete help from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be working this year on a programme to take account of the social effects of economic transition. This will promote education and training, the enhancement of the role of women and social security systems as well as actions on health.</p>
<p class="contents">I was not surprised that both reports called for increased support for civil society. I fully agree with these. The question is how best to go about it. I fear that financing micro-projects is not the answer. These are not cost-effective and they are wasteful of staff resources. Decentralised cooperation is to be welcomed, but not in the sense of relaunching the old Mediterranean decentralised cooperation programmes. However worthy their objectives, they were seriously criticised by the Court of Auditors and indeed they were seriously criticised by this Parliament. Rather we need to explain more clearly to civil society – whether NGOs, local authorities or other groups – that our programmes are open to their participation and they only need to organise themselves to respond to our calls for proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Good examples of this already exist in our sectoral regional cooperation programmes, for example on the environment, the cultural heritage and MEDA democracy. I propose to make a concerted effort in this sense and to try to generalise the approach. In the longer term, we could look at other ways of supporting civil society and I should certainly be prepared to consider any concrete proposals which Parliament may put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am glad to note the agreement all round on the need to raise the visibility of the partnership. I warmly welcome Parliament’s activities in this respect through international contacts at all levels. I am only sorry that I will not be able to attend the forum on 8 and 9 February, but I am on a troika visit on those two days. I hope Parliament will understand. We shall be supplementing our existing activities through the introduction of a dedicated programme using all the modern techniques at our disposal to ensure that the value of what we are doing is appreciated as widely as possible both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners.</p>
<p class="contents">One speaker, Mr Obiols i Germà, who I am delighted to see in his place, said that we must not just give lip service to our objectives in the Barcelona Process. Someone else, who I am afraid is not here, said we should give evidence of tangible action. That is what we are trying to do. That is what the document that we put on the table in Marseilles attempts to do: a serious effort to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process with concrete proposals for action.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as far as we are concerned in the Commission, we do not want to make the same old speeches, we do not want to go on the same old roundabouts of meetings and summits and conferences and bilateral agreements. We want to complete all the association agreements and get them ratified and we have a good chance of completing at least another two association agreements this year; I would hope for the lot. We must deal with issues like South-South trade and accumulation, we must deal with regional cooperation, we have to speed up delivery under MEDA. This is not a virtual policy. It is a real policy that we want to make work in real time. I hope that in future debates in Parliament – as well attended from beginning to end as this one has been, at least in part – we will be able to chart our progress in what must be one of the priorities for the external actions of the European Union.</p>
