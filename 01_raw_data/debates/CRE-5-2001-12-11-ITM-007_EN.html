It is one of the last, but also one of the most important stages in the sometimes complicated process in which the Community budget is brought about.</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly value the fact that I am able to make this statement before the MEPs who, as representatives of the European democracy, are meeting here in plenary session.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement, this second reading of the Council was preceded by a consultative meeting of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which took place on 21 November. I believe I can speak on behalf of all participants in this lengthy meeting, which did not finish until the small hours, when I say that it was not only a success from a budgetary point of view, because the general budget for 2002 will now soon be established, but also politically speaking, for we managed to agree on a number of new elements which presented themselves to us since our first reading and which need to be discussed, as well as a number of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Council, I should like to express a word of thanks to the Parliament’s delegations and Mrs Schreyer, who went out of her way to achieve this result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first of all like to focus on the new elements. Needless to say, there were the events of 11 September. Entirely in line with what was decided at the consultation meeting, the Council wanted to set up a scheme to finance the effects in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries after these tragic events. In our jargon, this means that the geographically oriented budget items are increased, and by these we mean the items for Asia and TACIS of the external policy. For example, at second reading, the Council decided to pledge a total amount of nearly EUR 488 million in commitment appropriations for Asia. The Council also wanted to leave open a wide margin under the maximum of Heading 4 ‘External action’ with a view to meeting possible future needs in those regions. This margin is also in line with the agreement that was reached with the European Parliament to maintain a minimum margin of EUR 70 million for any needs in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. Moreover, I should like to remind you that it was also agreed to earmark a minimum amount of EUR 35 million in reserve for emergency aid of Heading 6 for possible needs of this kind. These elements formed an important part of the discussions we held.</p>
<p class="contents">Another new element that came up in the discussions, is the conversion programme of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleet following the failure to set up a fisheries agreement with Morocco. In this respect, the Council has included EUR 170 million of commitment appropriations under Heading 2 of the draft budget and has decided to use the flexibility instrument for the corresponding amount. In this connection, may I remind you that the Council, by way of accommodating the EP’s wishes, has approved a specific allocation of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 2 for the regions which border the candidate countries, and has also approved the use of the flexibility instrument for the corresponding amount?</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of the agreement with the European Parliament on an amount of EUR 20 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 3 for those border regions, the Council has approved the trial project: ‘Effects of enlargement in the border regions’. This agreement was unquestionably one of the key points of the 2002 budgetary procedure. In order to give this more lasting form, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have decided in favour of inclusion in the 2003 budget, taking into consideration the maximum amounts established in Berlin, together with EUR 27 million that were not placed on the 2002 budget which form part of the EUR 197 million which the Commission had proposed in the financial statement pertaining to the fleet conversion programme, as well as EUR 15 million for the border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the priorities are concerned, I would remind you that the Council officially adopted conclusions concerning the budgetary guidelines for the forthcoming budgetary procedure in March of this year for the first time. In doing so, the Council wanted to indicate its budgetary procedures for the year 2002, as is the European Parliament’s and the Commission’s wont. During the negotiations, the Council continually pointed at these principles and priorities, and adhered to the same. In my view, this is a sound method, for it indicates more clearly what it is about and what the goal is, and it enhances transparency. I therefore believe that we all stand to benefit from the Council’s continued efforts in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with the priorities which are close to the European Parliament’s heart. I am delighted that an agreement has been reached in the framework of the joint declaration on the management of the commitments outstanding (the RALs) and of the elimination in the medium term of what people started to refer to as ‘abnormal RALs’. I would point out that abnormal RALs, which we defined as sleeping obligations for which no payments have been made over the past two years, as well as old obligations which have been on the budget for at least five years, cannot only be reduced by increasing the appropriations for payment, but also by causing obligations to lapse to a large extent. I believe that the measures announced by the Commission will ensure that this matter be resolved satisfactorily in due course. Moreover, we managed to agree on a statement regarding the implementation profile for the 2002 budget. This statement means that the implementation of the budget will be spread over the course of the year as equally as possible. The so-called December fever must be avoided in this respect. In order to achieve this, the Commission has envisaged the following measures. It aims to implement the 2002 budget, taking into account the implementation of the 2001 budget, and make the necessary changes. The budgetary authority will be notified when the implementation profile deviates considerably from the proposed profile. Furthermore, an implementation plan for the 2002 per heading of the financial perspectives will be sent upon submittal of the preliminary draft budget for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that these measures correspond to the horizontal amendments which the European Parliament approved at first reading, so that we can look forward to the budget approval with confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also devoted special attention to the priorities which the European Parliament had listed at first reading, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> by agreeing to the additional appropriations for <span class="italic">e</span>-learning and immigration. Needless to say, I am pleased with the post-ECSC regulations and the pledge by the Spanish Presidency to redraft the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude this last list of priorities to be taken into account with one of the Council’s essential priorities, namely the controlled increase of payment appropriations. I shall come back to this in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">At second reading of the budget, we took account of the agreements concluded during consultation. We have tried to adopt a budget which can accommodate all the EU’s priorities, on the one hand, and which can take into consideration the points which were brought up after first reading without losing sight of the real needs and scope for spending the appropriations, on the other. I should like to outline the other results to you for each heading.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, letter of amendment 2 has been adopted in its entirety. Moreover, the Council has restored the proposed amounts in the preliminary draft budget for the budget lines which were cut at first reading and to which the letter of amendment refers. An additional EUR 4.5 million has been included, as agreed during the consultation of 21 November, whereby Parliament’s observations were taken into account. In a joint declaration with the European Parliament, special attention has been paid to the protection of animals during transport. I am also delighted that our institutions can reach agreement on the points of this letter of amendment which pertain to expenditure for rural development, fisheries agreements and the inclusion in the budget of the surplus available from the previous budget year in the sum of EUR 1.2 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I have already outlined the key results in connection with the structural measures, namely the inclusion of EUR 170 million by way of commitment appropriations and EUR 39 million in payment appropriations for the conversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleet, and the amount of EUR 30 million for the regions which border the candidate countries, whereby use is made of the flexibility instrument in both cases.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to internal policy, the Council has kept most points of its first reading and has also partially adopted a number of major amendments of the European Parliament, including <span class="italic">e</span>-learning, which entails EUR 5 million, and the European refugee fund, which entails an increase of EUR 5 million. The rapporteurs have tried to convince us and they have succeeded, but the Council’s willingness to cooperate should also be highlighted here, in my view. It is under this heading that quite a considerable proportion of the measures will be funded for the benefit of the regions which border the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the external policy is concerned, the Council has not only increased the budget items covering Asia and TACIS by EUR 66 million compared to the draft budget, it has also adopted letter of amendment 2 concerning international fisheries agreements. Concerning the common security policy, an amount of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations has been included, in accordance with the results of the consultation of 21 November.</p>
<p class="contents">As for administrative expenses, the three institutions agreed to hold extensive discussions about the report of the Secretaries General regarding the multi-annual development. In my view, quite a few options are still left open.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the EP’s budget is concerned, the Council has adopted draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 5 for 2001, by means of which expenditure for buildings can be forecast in the framework of the 2003 budget, with the obligation to reduce the expenditure in 2003 by an equal amount.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of years now, the Council has adopted a comprehensive approach during its reading, which means that the main issues in the draft budget are the set priorities and the extent of the expenditure category. Thanks to this approach, the Council has managed to remain under the existing annual maximum amounts of expenditure, established in the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999. Additionally, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement, it has managed to ensure that within the maximum amounts of financial perspectives, margins remain available, as a result of which different Community measures and policy lines can be prioritised.</p>
<p class="contents">When the second reading was drafted, the Council aimed for a budgetary discipline, so much so that the budget increases are in line with those of the national budgets. The total increase of payment appropriations is therefore restricted to 2%. As you know, agreement was reached during the consultation of 21 November in the framework of this general agreement with the help of the Commission. The Council relies on the fact that the European Parliament will carry on in this vein during its second reading, so that the percentage increase does not exceed the agreed maximum amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Before you have a final discussion on the budget, I should like to emphasise that the Council has endeavoured to take account of certain budgetary rules and basic provisions concerning the inclusion in the reserve of appropriations, the make-up of expenditure, legal bases, preparatory actions and trial projects. That is why the Council would state once again that it is opposed to Parliament’s use of conditional reserves, which is in contravention of the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council has once again opted for the outcome of the first reading of the draft budget for heading B7-1 concerning the European Development Fund, since the increase of a funding or even of a margin in the budget lacks the necessary legal basis and is therefore not possible. Moreover, allow me to remind you that this is intrinsically about compulsory expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude this brief outline of the second reading by the Council by highlighting that the budgetary procedure been conducted in a good atmosphere. As in the past, emotions sometimes ran high during the discussions. Everyone has put forward their view in clear, concise, sometimes lengthy, yet forceful terms. However, the aim of the consultation procedure has not been overlooked: namely to bring about agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority with the help of the Commission. In that way, we can adopt a budget which enables the European Union to face its challenges, and also to accommodate the circumstances and the developments which can be anticipated during the 2002 budgetary year and programme in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">On my own behalf and that of the Council, I should like to thank in particular Mr Terence Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the two rapporteurs, Mr Carlos Costa Neves and Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg, as well as all the members of the Committee on Budgets, with whom I have had the pleasure of working over these six months of the presidency of the Council, in which I have not only become familiar with the European budgetary procedure, but have also learnt to appreciate it. I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of a markedly balanced end result, it is only fair to single out the work of the members of the Budgetary Commission, the vital contribution of the draftsmen of the opinions of other committees, the responsible involvement of the political groups, the negotiating skills of the Belgian Presidency demonstrated by Minister Vande Lanotte, whom I congratulate, the competence of the Commission departments, which I hereby single out in the person of the Director-General for the Budget, Mr Mangasson, the work of the entire College of Commissioners and the particular endeavours of the Commissioner for the Budget, Mrs Schreyer, whom I would also like to congratulate. I would also like to make a special personal reference to the invaluable support and contribution of the secretariat of the Budgetary Commission for the excellent results they achieved. They went far beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p class="contents">In a rapid assessment of the results achieved, we should mention the establishment of better conditions for continuing to improve the performance of the budget and make it more effective. The joint declarations issued by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are very important. For the first time, the Council accepted amendments adopted at first reading by Parliament within the framework of the common agricultural policy, thereby opening up promising prospects for cooperation. It was also possible to meet new needs deriving from the failure to sign the fisheries agreement with Morocco and the impact of enlargement through the financing of a restructuring programme for the Portuguese and Spanish fishing fleets, and specific support for certain border regions. Fourthly, financing was agreed for three new agencies with competence in the area of maritime safety, air safety and food quality.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an initial response to new challenges relating to the situation following the attacks of September 11, in particular in the areas of policing, justice and external action; here again special reference should be made to the financing of humanitarian and reconstruction actions in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would further stress the strengthening of the ability to act in terms of <span class="italic">e-learning</span> and the special importance given to the response to the tragic situation of the refugees. Support for the Commission reforms and progress in preparing for enlargement are also envisaged. Compliance with commitments entered into previously, whether in the context of Agenda 2000 with regard to the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds, or with regard to programmes arising from codecision or even concerning the policy on external action, are also matters which should be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is only normal that new challenges are appearing for the future. I would single out the following: the endowments needed for expenses of Headings III – Internal Policies, IV – External Policies and V – Administrative Expenses are subject to enormous pressure and the fact that the situation is under control for the time being should not delude us. The problems will arise again in the next few years and it will become increasingly difficult to find solutions. In this context, I would mention with regret the rigidity of the budgetary structure deriving from the Financial Perspective in force, which means that in some categories there are substantial balances and in others the situation is becoming increasingly complicated. It is incomprehensible that with the current difficulties in various sectors, such as external action, there was a balance of EUR 11 billion outstanding in the year 2000, which is around 14% of the total expenditure. We must have the courage to adopt in good time the solutions that in this case are so obvious. At the same time, it must be stated again that the division of budgetary expenses into compulsory and non-compulsory is a completely outdated concept and, in the light of the most elementary principles of democracy, it is unacceptable for the effective competence of Parliament to be limited to non-compulsory expenses (around half of the budget) and it is incomprehensible that it has no competence as regards the revenue system.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2002 budget is ready and I believe it merits your approval. As for the tasks for the future and the new role of the European Parliament in the budgetary process, we will be here to deal with them. Once again, thank you all very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Costa Neves, for all the work he has done over the past year. For the equanimity and meticulousness which he employed, his willingness to take the contribution of other, also smaller, groups seriously and the way in which he managed to persuade everyone to adopt the same line, which was no mean feat.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of the budgetary procedure, it looked as if the pain for the 2002 budget was mainly concentrated in heading 5. Needless to say, I was delighted with this as rapporteur. However, now, having reached December, we could say that Mr Costa Neves has yet again assumed the leading role, for Heading 4 is now also showing cracks again. For the third year running, we have had to supplement the budget by 200 million by calling on the flexibility instrument. We therefore continue to scrounge in order to fund the political tasks of the European Union. Despite this, it was once again possible to reach agreement with the Council. However, as far as my group is concerned, our support is not really heart-felt, and this has everything to do with the tragic rituals and traditions which typify the budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has praised the Community budgetary method and although, admittedly, this method always ultimately culminates in agreement, more than anything, the annual budgetary ritual is a rather irrational process. The Commission presents a proposal, the Council takes a huge slice off the proposed amount, Parliament adds a bit more, and we are then supposed to come up with something wonderful in the renowned consultation. It did occur to me to break up the cycle and to simply leave a number of Council cutbacks in heading 5 where they are, including the cutback at the Court of Justice. It did seem like a healthy exercise to let the Council come face to face with the effects of its actions and its unilateral obsession to remain well below the ceiling of the financial perspectives. Unfortunately, I did not do this. I have had feedback that that is what I should have done. I decided against it because otherwise the wrong people would yet again be penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">This view about assuming one’s responsibility fits in well with the idea that we also mooted at first reading, namely that political promises made by Heads of Governments and Ministers should be accompanied by a financial picture. We have drawn the necessary lessons in the reconstruction of the Balkans, and it seems fairer to me if it is indicated whether new tasks also require new funding, and – that is at the same time a promise – whether aid to a region in crisis will require cutbacks in peace projects in the Middle East or in projects against sexual violence in South Africa. What is at any rate a bonus is that this time, aid to Afghanistan featured as a prominent part of the consultation and, unlike in the Balkans, external pledges were not made at donor conferences first, upon which we were expected to pick up the pieces, but these were discussed during the consultations. I hope that this was not simply a question of good timing, but the start of a positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Another bizarre aspect of the budgetary procedure is the implementation of the budget, and we as Parliament are also guilty of making empty promises. We want tens of millions of euros more for South America, for instance, without knowing exactly why only 60% of last year’s funding was spent. And each year, we intend to better monitor and adjust the Commission’s budget, which is no reason not to do it this year. My group will therefore grant priority to this aspect during the preparation of the 2003 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my group <span class="italic">is</span> pleased with the minor changes in the Council’s budget in the area of foreign policy expenditure. Not a great deal of money is involved, but it is significant nevertheless. It is now clear that Parliament will from now on give its verdict about the Council’s budget in terms of operational expenditure, which is an improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget is a means, not an end. It funds our activities for citizens in Europe and elsewhere, and if there is one slogan of which the European policy-maker cannot get enough, then surely it must be that Europe should be closer to the citizen. And you cannot get much closer than the people of Elsene, our neighbours in Brussels, and I am therefore delighted with the paragraph in the present resolution which urges us to draw up a sound inventory of what we need, and how we can provide for it, and also to take account of the interests of the citizens in the immediate vicinity, before we start making plans for new Parliament buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would thank the Bureau for all its efforts and I hope that the planned hearing will lead to positive results, also with regard to the conservation of the quaint little station. It is important to put forward great visions, but it is just as important to face up to the practical implications of these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report which I have just had the honour of presenting deals with an important contribution to the Community’s budgeting and programming system. We had an agreement, based on the joint declaration of 20 July 2000, in which we established a system for programming and verifying the activities of the Commission in relation to the Financial Perspectives. Its objective was to serve as a guide for the decisions of the Budgetary Authority, offer a vision of the margins available in each heading, taking account of the contributions already approved during the codecision procedure, and facilitating the application of the new assessment procedure originating from the aforementioned joint declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in an important financial year and, for the first time – we will thank the Commission for this – it offers us this opportunity to see the programming of Headings 3 and 4, in relation to our activities. There is an issue which interests us, a very methodological issue, on how to plan, in the future, the programmes which are already under way, and there is just one point which interests us: for certain programmes, for certain budget lines, future inflation is included, by means of what the Commission calls a budgetary deflater, and, in our opinion, it ought to be a budgetary inflater.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a technical contradiction here. The Financial Perspectives are expressed in standard euros, while the programming works in current euros for each year. The result is that we do not really know, when we reach an agreement, what value we may have for the previous year because it will depend on real inflation. Anybody who has been a trade unionist knows that one can lie through statistics in many ways and this is one of them – by mixing current prices with standard prices; and I will not therefore insist on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to give you an example – by hiding future inflation in the framework programme, the Commission reaches the conclusion that, according to its figures, between 2002 and 2006, we will have an increase in annual contributions of 14.3%. Inflation is hiding the fact that, basically, we really only have an increase of 4.9%. This is the real increase. The rest, which brings it up to 14%, is inflation. That is what we do not like.</p>
<p class="contents">The other day, the Commission told the Committee on Budgets that, with the euro, inflation is dead. Praise the Lord! I accept that, but I am from the school of Saint Thomas and prefer, when it comes to these things, to see before believing. When I have seen that inflation has disappeared, I will accept the removal of this type of differentiation between standard prices and current prices and, therefore, this is the main issue from our point of view. All the rest of the Commission’s work we believe to be excellent. Our concern is really to prevent a situation where, through this technique, the higher real inflation is, the greater the margin available will be.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense and therefore our request, included in the motion for a resolution, is very simple: if it suits the Commission to continue working, for whatever reason, in terms of current euros, it should do so, but the information it offers Parliament must also be expressed in standard euros. This is the key point of our report. As for everything else, I would like to thank the Commission for the effort it has made to offer us this information for the first time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is in my name because the person who has done all the work on this, the standing rapporteur for the financial perspective, Mr Colom i Naval, decided after a lot of consideration that he could not present it to Parliament. I know his reasons why. I have spoken to him about them. I can respect those reasons but I am somewhat saddened that he is not giving this report instead of me.</p>
<p class="contents">For the last three years the flexibility instrument has been the main aspect of the budget and it has overshadowed everything else. On this occasion we are using it for two programmes, as has been said by speakers before me. I do not have to outline what that is, but I have to outline one small problem which we have not yet resolved, that is, how the remaining money – the EUR 27 million for the reconversion of the Spanish fisheries fleet – will be found for the budget after next year. That remains an issue on which I am sure the Commission will be creative and inventive when it comes to next year's budget – to make sure that money can be found, because it is certainly expected.</p>
<p class="contents">When the interinstitutional agreement was agreed, the flexibility instrument was one of the items which was reluctantly agreed by both sides – reluctantly from our side because there was a lot of resistance to the IIA anyway. Do not forget that it was passed in this Parliament by a simple majority, not by a qualified majority. That was an issue in itself. The Council did not really like this idea anyway. If I remember correctly it was the Commission that proposed it as a way out of the impasse. It is a good job that it was proposed because it has 'saved our bacon' for the last three years. In the first instance it was the great debate on how to fund Kosovo. The Council did not want to use it and we went to the wire, if you can remember that famous occasion in this Chamber when we each had two voting lists. Then last year it was on how to fund Serbia. That in itself was a problem and now on this occasion we have how to fund the reconversion of the fisheries fleet and also the cross-border initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">These last three years have shown the creaking structure of the financial perspective. I am sure that this is a point that Mr Colom i Naval would have made. We have a situation where the financial perspective has great problems with heading 3, heading 4 and certainly heading 5. Unless Parliament and Council begin to get some sort of agreement on how to fund these categories in the future, the consequences will be there for all to see. It is the consequences of pre-enlargement. It is not necessarily enlargement itself. The preparations for pre-enlargement will be as big a headache as the enlargement issue itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the needs of Afghanistan, or perhaps I should say the unknown needs of Afghanistan. What are we going to do about that? What are we going to do if we get a hoped-for peace agreement in the Middle East? Where is that money going to come from? There is no room at present in heading 4. I have heard rumours that the Commission may be proposing an extra flexibility instrument for heading 4. If it does, it will be a welcome addition, but whether it would be agreed by the Council is a different matter. This head-in-the-sand attitude cannot prevail if we are trying to be serious about how we manage the Union's budget and the taxpayers' expenses in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations with the Belgian presidency at the second conciliation were 100% better than the first conciliation, which was a waste of time, as I made known last time. At least this time it was good to do business with the Belgians, as it was last time when I was general rapporteur for the 1994 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There are areas where we have our differences, such as in heading 3 where we have always had difficulties. In heading 5, one of the main areas where we differ is in our support for the Commission on the reform programme, especially on the establishment plan and the posts that are needed. However, whilst we have agreed on the establishment plan, the Committee on Budgets voted for one third of those posts in reserve, albeit by a one-vote majority. The coordinators and the rapporteur are working very hard to try to ensure that we can get a position which will deliver a qualified majority on Thursday because if we do not, we may end up with the Council's position which would not aid the Commission's reform process as we would want it to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen the letter that Commissioners Schreyer, Kinnock and de Palacio have written, where they state that the conditions for release of the reserve have been met. If I was not the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I would say that I agree with those sentiments, but since I am the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I could not possibly say any such thing. I would like you to know that hopefully, between the vote on Thursday and the not-too-distant future, we can all be in a position where we can see the Commission's proposals coming to fruition and we can get on with the job of making Europe the place that the citizens expect it to be and not associated with the great mystique that it represents for too many of them right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turchi (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s annual report on Trans-European Networks provides a general outlook on Community assistance in the three main areas of TENs (transport, energy and telecommunications), which are financed either through the general Union budget or through other Community sources such as the EIB and the Cohesion Fund. I believe that, overall, it is a good report, if one also takes into account the fact that 1999 was a pivotal year for this sector, in fact, 1999 saw the modification of the financial regulation, the approval of the financial framework for 2000-2006 and the creation of ISPA; this year, 50% of the funding was devoted to transport infrastructure works and the emergence of Galileo as a new and priority TEN project. This does not mean, however, that there are no criticisms to be levelled at the Commission; these derive above all from the type of report it has given us and not from the implementation of the Trans-European Networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The first criticism I intend to make about the report concerns the lack of references to the qualitative development of TEN projects. Very often, the initiation and completion of projects have taken much longer than expected because of procedural differences and a lack of coordination. In several cases, Member States have had different priorities, while the notion of public or private partnership is not yet well developed. In future, therefore, the Commission should attach additional information on the projects to its reports, such as, for instance, the original plans, timetables and the results achieved. This would, first and foremost, increase transparency and thus also permit more effective and productive monitoring of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financial evaluation of TENs should include information on funding through local, regional and national budgets and also through private resources, since roughly 80% of the total funds comes from these sources. It would thus be possible to obtain an overall view of the state of funding and to check that the commitments undertaken by Member States are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe that the financial resources available for TENs are too limited in view of the continual challenges faced by the transport sector. The percentage of TEN activities funded by the general budget is constantly falling, while EIB loans cover more than three-quarters of the funding in this sector, and this is highlighted. My view is that the funding package for transport TENs should be reviewed and adapted to actual needs, especially in light of the reductions in other sectors, such as the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe we must properly address the problem of road traffic, the constant increase in which runs contrary to the objectives that were proposed when TENs were created. I think this is due to a lack of cross-border cooperation, which necessarily undermines the interoperability and promotion of rail networks. To get round this problem it will, I think, be necessary to gradually shift the emphasis away from the Essen priority projects and national infrastructure projects towards transit and cross-border projects, so as to strengthen the policy of sustainable transport and promote integration between different modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should also like to mention the budget that we are about to vote on. I believe we have come to the end of two not inconsiderable political problems which reflect the additional needs which have emerged in view of the changed international situation. In second reading, we have left an ample margin for assistance to Afghanistan and neighbouring regions, and with the Council we have agreed on the figure of EUR 488 million for cooperation with developing countries in Asia. Once again, then, we have given evidence of our political sensitivity and lent our support to the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was unthinkable that the Union might absent itself at a time like this, and it was also unthinkable that Parliament might default after the explicit request by the Council. This does not, however, mean that everything is fine and that no criticisms should be made. Nevertheless, I must especially congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, as well as all the Secretariat staff who have helped and supported us through both good and difficult moments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the period of the budget negotiations, that is to say from the time the preliminary draft budget was submitted to the present day, many new demands on the EU budget have arisen. World events, the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the war in Afghanistan, and the crisis in the Middle East have all given rise to new budgetary requirements. The crises in the agricultural sector that we have witnessed this year have meant new budget requirements in the coming year, and the public's changing expectations also need to be reflected. Together, we have succeeded in adapting the 2002 budget to these new challenges and given how often the European Union is criticised, we should make sure that this positive outcome is heard loud and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded, and this is thanks to the well-balanced and reconciliatory way in which you, Mr Costa Neves, have approached the negotiations, and we wish to thank you very sincerely for that. We have also succeeded because of the exacting approach of the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, who also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, and we have succeeded because of the skilful way in which the negotiations were conducted at the crucial point by the President-in-Office – by you, Mr Vande Lanotte – and I would like to sincerely thank all of you, together with the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Colom i Naval, the entire committee, and also you, Mr Turchi, on behalf of the entire Commission, for this very fruitful cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention Mr Seppänen. He had the historic task of presenting the report on the last budget of the European Coal and Steel Community. And we can also describe the level of the EU budget as well-nigh historical, that is to say the EU budget share. The budget as a proportion of Europe's GNP is lower for next year than at any time during the 1990s. It will amount to only 1.03% of Europe's GNP. The EU budget is accordingly EUR 4.6 billion lower than the amount provided for next year in the financial perspective. EUR 4.6 billion is almost 5% of the entire budget, or to put it another way, it was envisaged in the financial perspective that the budget for 2002 might be 5% higher than is now actually being agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am stressing this point firstly because it reflects the budgetary discipline that prevails at European level, and, Mr President-in-Office, because the EU budget is therefore below the average growth rate for budgets in the Member States. That is also worth emphasising.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this result also demonstrates that scope for action has been created to allow the EU to take on new financial tasks, and I am referring here, in particular, to the debate on the costs of enlargement. That therefore means that Europe, the European budget, is prepared to assume new tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid to Afghanistan for peaceful future development of that country is a new task for which the European Union should, and will, assume responsibility. An initial provision has been made for this in the 2002 budget, with EUR 130 million in addition to the funds already earmarked for humanitarian aid. This is a positive result, particularly in view of the fact that it would be disastrous if we were to reduce our commitment to the Balkans. That cannot be allowed to happen, and for that reason the same amount is being made available for the Balkans as this year, with a part being brought forward to the end of the current budget year.</p>
<p class="contents">Further aid is also needed for Palestine. Together with other donors, we are making good some of the loss of income that the Palestinian Autonomy Authority has suffered because Israel is holding back tax and customs receipts because of the escalation of the conflict. The use of this money in Palestine is subject to strict controls. It is supervised by the International Monetary Fund, and there are no indications that this money is being misused to purchase arms. That would of course be totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is supporting public health and it is supporting education. We want to use our contributions to give the peace process a chance. That is our aim, I am very glad that at yesterday's Council press conference the Minister, Mr Perez stressed that Israel, too, regards financial support for Palestine as being important.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is in the process of shouldering more responsibility on the world political scene, and that is a good thing. This involves a greater commitment to civil crisis management, which in turn requires financial means and, as you know, and as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has stressed once again, the budgetary rules are such that funds released elsewhere cannot simply be used for additional expenditure on external policy. Of the EUR 4.6 billion that the 2002 budget will be below the amount provided for next year in the financial perspective, we cannot just use EUR 400 or 500 million for coping with external policy crises. Nor can we simply use money from the budget surplus to finance new requirements. That is why the Commission has proposed that by means of an agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, an extra reserve should be created for additional external policy actions, and I believe that this is in fact the ideal way to avoid unravelling the financial perspective whilst still addressing the new challenges facing the Community in a Community-oriented way. It would be a good thing if the Laeken Council could also express its support for this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">A new feature of the 2002 budget is the commitment of funds for measures in the area of judicial cooperation, including the development of the new information system for Schengen and for Eurojust. The Commission's estimate of funds for this area is something quite new.</p>
<p class="contents">Another new item is the programme to restructure the Spanish and to some extent the Portuguese fishing fleets which up to now have been able to fish in Morocco's waters. The Commission welcomes the fact that the budgetary authority accepts the Commission's proposal both with regard to the level of this special programme – EUR 197 million – and also concerning the specific shape of the programme and the proposal to finance it by mobilising the flexibility instrument. The compromise solution of making additional funds available in the 2002 budget for the regions bordering the candidate countries was really not easy to achieve. However, the compromise of entering part of the additional amount in the 2003 budget for these two requirements is acceptable, and I can assure you that the Commission will make the necessary financial proposals for 2003, so that the funds for the programme to restructure the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets will be available.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to Spain and the border regions to implement the programmes being allocated additional funds as rapidly as possible, and the Commission will support this. I say this because it is evident that the public and the fishing industry in Spain expect this now, as do small and medium-sized enterprises in the border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has this year once again very strongly supported the Commission's reform process during the discussions on the budget. I would like to express the Commission's heartfelt thanks for this. However, I nevertheless wish to touch on one point, and a very important one at that, regarding the reserve for the 105 new posts envisaged up to now. In the Committee on Budgets you agreed two conditions for lifting this reserve. The first is that the Commission should bring forward a proposal for a permanent early retirement scheme. The Commission has already included this in its guidelines for personnel policy, and will consult on a proposal for amending the statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The second condition was better matching of budgetary decisions and the Commission's work programme. This was also the subject of this morning's debate, and the Commission undertakes that, as from next year, it will present the most important initiatives with an impact on the budget at an earlier stage. I can also assure you personally that I will support this request for the budgetary implications for the coming year of new legislative proposals to be made clear at the appropriate stage of the budget process. I hope that we will also reach a satisfactory outcome on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Two thousand and two is an important year for agricultural policy. The interim review of the agricultural policy has to be presented. Next year the agricultural budget will rise by only 0.5%, which is less than the average, and that is despite the fact that, for example, there is EUR 400 million in the budget for the reimbursement of expenditure to Member States because of foot and mouth disease and that a total of EUR 8 billion is available for the beef sector. The reform process, the mid-term review, not only has a financial dimension, it is also about setting objectives in agricultural policy, and the second pillar, the promotion of rural development, has an important role to play here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the Sapard programme of pre-accession aid for agriculture, the Commission still considers that the proposal for a new programme is not the right way to go. Two thousand and two will also be a very important year for the enlargement of the European Union. Negotiations should be concluded for the countries that have made the greatest progress, and in concrete terms this means that budget-related negotiations on agricultural policy, structural policy and on the budget itself will be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council intends to have determined its common negotiating position for the budget chapter by the end of next June. The budget chapter is, of course, the crowning achievement of the accession negotiations. The Commission has already agreed to present a proposal that will not go beyond the amounts set in Agenda 2000 for new Member States for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. That was also laid down in the interinstitutional agreement. The Commission accordingly expects to receive the support of the budgetary authority for no more and no less than these annual amounts being made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Two thousand and two is also the year in which the convention on the reform of the European treaties will start its work. We are now virtually on the eve of the Laeken Summit and of having to agree the programme of work for the convention. An important subject for the future to be dealt with by the convention will be the Parliament's budget rights. The outcome of the 2002 budget negotiations is evident and this outcome will once again enable the challenges to be met. Nevertheless, it should be clear for the future that the European Parliament finally deserves full budget rights. This is a touchstone for the democratic development of the European Union.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to offer congratulations and thanks to all my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets. It is a rare privilege – and I can measure its worth as a committee rapporteur – to be able to say that the Committee on Budgets accepted all the demands we had made, they were, of course, legitimate and carefully considered, and which were put forward in Parliament at second reading. So I want to thank the general rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to address the Council more directly, address the intelligence of the Council, if I dare put it that way, knowing that Mr Vande Lanotte is bound to understand what I mean. Four years ago, the European Parliament proposed setting up a European fund for refugees, an idea that the Council angrily struck off the list at second reading. No European refugee fund. Four years have passed and now the Council has just proposed more money than we ourselves had even asked for the European refugee fund it had refused to create. It took the Council all of four years to understand, to become responsible and, with respect, to show some intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example: for several years now we have included a Schengen list at the budget’s first reading, because for several years we have wanted some of its aspects to be communitised and financed from the Community budget. Each year the Council would angrily strike off the Schengen heading at second reading. This time, the Council needs the Schengen heading we had introduced because it has to finance SIS II and has decided to finance it on a Community basis.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the third problem. We decided – Parliament did so at first reading and will do so at second reading – to vote to enter EUR 5 million under the Europol heading to combat terrorism. The Council did not accept this at second reading. I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to do the impossible and to create the necessary legal basis and agreements. I would ask it to use this money without waiting four years, because the terrorists for their part will not wait that long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decision to deal with the agencies on an individual basis was an important one. I have very carefully read through the amendments proposed by the specialised committees, and to those of you who sit on them I would therefore like to send out a signal. I ask you, firstly, to take a close look at the agencies with a view to seeing whether or not they work well, and then read the report of the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else, too, about the new agencies. I think policy is tending in the direction of creating even more agencies, something, which also appears to be the Commission's strategy. In general terms, this is not to be rejected out of hand, but it becomes objectionable when it comes to finance, as the Commission does not include their funds in the calculations. So if, in future, the Commission or the agencies, as the case may be, come wanting more resources, then heading 3 will not be able to take the strain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had a tough budgetary procedure especially in relation to the priorities of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. This will present my committee with problems in meeting obligations on a number of programmes. These programmes are not just crucial to achieving a dynamic knowledge – based Europe but, in the light of the tough current economic climate that the European businesses and organisations are facing, our key to achieving our aims of creating new jobs and supporting businesses. However, I appreciate the constraints that we are working under and, as someone who in the past has emphasised the need for prudence, efficiency and economy, I know that my committee will do its utmost to deliver growth and prosperity for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues that I really want to raise concern the implementation of the budget. First, there is the Commission habit of ignoring some of the priorities of this budget authority and I want to give you an example from my committee in relation to the synergy programme. It is a small programme, but nevertheless an important one. However, it did not actually suit the particular director-general to implement this programme last year and so it was just ignored because they believed it did not have a big enough impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the use of transfers, which I believe are open to misuse because often these happen very late in the budgetary process and the Commission will transfer money from areas which are priorities for Parliament to those that are priorities for them. We must have mechanisms in place to stop this recurring year on year.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the lack of synchronisation between the budgetary process and the launch of legislative programmes. It makes a mockery of the budgetary process and the authorities when you have the launch of the budgetary process in February and the launch of the legislative programme in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Very quickly, I wish to move on to the other institutions budgets. This concentrates largely on preparations for enlargement. I understand that Parliament has made plans for new buildings to incorporate the new Member States. However, if we are increasing buildings in Brussels, it is important that we learn from the lessons from Strasbourg and that we do not make the same mistakes as we did with this building which generated a lot of negative publicity and reflected very badly on Parliament. Therefore, for the future, it is important that we have a clear explanation of what these buildings are going to be used for and that these buildings are environmentally friendly, user-friendly and cater for people with disabilities. I must express surprise that we are already negotiating on new buildings in the absence of major decisions in a variety of areas including the language regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have to admit that I still feel slightly resentful about the Council’s result. I am pleased with the final, positive result, but on the other hand, why did the Council present such an unacceptable initial proposal? It truly seemed as if the members of the Council were, once again, behaving like little boys running riot with cap pistols, as I expressed it a number of years ago. Fortunately, everything got straightened out, for we would have had major problems with the whole of the budget on account of heading 3. I really fail to understand how the Council dares present proposals of this kind. In my opinion, we have made a rather considerable concession with regard to payments. I believe that we should monitor this more closely in future. The Council seems to have taken an interest in this, and it may be wise to be a little less generous next time than we were this year. But that is a matter for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight that, in future, we will be extremely short of cash in Headings 3, 4 and 5. We subscribe to what the Commissioner referred to, namely how relatively little the Union is currently spending. We must, of course, also bear in mind that as soon as new Member States join, the outlook will change immediately. We are therefore putting some savings away for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which causes great concern, in my view, is the Council’s attitude towards projects which could improve employment. The issue surrounding Galileo springs to mind, which has caused great difficulty. All other points which cost money from the EU budget and which can contribute to better economic performances in the coming year – and there are quite a few of those – have been systematically discouraged, and if we do not sufficiently appreciate this, we will really end up in a recession. If we see what the Americans are currently doing, how much money they are prepared to pour into their recession, we do not have to copy all of this, but we can move slightly in that direction and manage our funds wisely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been a budget procedure which has so far run with remarkable smoothness. We recognise the pressures on the budget – whether it is the Balkans, Palestine, enlargement, Afghanistan or the demand for action in new fields of activity. Balancing these pressures has been quite a performance, particularly on behalf of the Commission, and for that we say thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">In those sectors that are the concern of the Environment Committee I particularly welcome the establishment of frameworks and long-term funding regimes which have certainly stabilised our work in the area of consumers. I welcome the developing framework in the area of health where it is certainly going to encourage the development of steady progress in that field. It is equally important to say that those kind of stable funding regimes assist our work enormously. I am pleased that they have been, in the most part, respected.</p>

There was nothing else to be done. The Commission's amending letter being as modest as it was, one could hardly build up anything great on it. As we know how little room there is for change when it comes to compulsory expenditure in the agricultural sector, I think we have to give you credit for having fought and won a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to single out one point, one, which makes very clear the dilemma as regards the agricultural budget. We all know that our hands are more or less tied when it comes to compulsory expenditure, that they are tied, too, when it comes to outlining compulsory expenditure and thus outlining the common agricultural policy. Where we could make headway – the second pillar, which is a no more substantial beanstalk than it was before, where we have more obligations than we can meet – we are unable to transfer funds from the compulsory expenditure. Our self-imposed captivity must at some point come to an end. Not for the first time, I claim for Parliament not only the unhindered right to set a Budget, but also I claim for it the full right of co-decision in the area of the common agricultural policy. If these rights are not granted to us, then this dilemma will remain unresolved.</p>

Of that I am convinced. It was for that reason that the committee did not want to bring in any new Budget lines at the present time, with the exception of the flexibility reserve because of the Morocco disaster, which has been a heavy blow for the fisheries sector and raised many issues. We did, though, seek a few small changes. A: on food safety, especially with regard to genetic engineering, where there is an urgent need for scientific underpinning. B: on the monitoring of fishing activity. We need rigid controls and, perhaps, financial sanctions to deal with the black sheep.

The justification for them is false, as the enterprises had, in a ‘Memorandum of understanding’, taken a positive line on their financial participation as early as the beginning of 2001, without the political will having been present at that time.

There has definitely been a breakthrough this year in the area of aid, on which I have been working.

<p class="contents">Parliament’s scrutiny and control of aid money will substantially increase. The conditions are now much better than they previously were for bringing order and method into an activity which is unfortunately often characterised by anything but those qualities. The fact that the Commission has accepted as a benchmark that a third of the aid must be used as social assistance also definitely represents progress. The agreement guarantees greater focus upon programmes and activities of special importance in combating poverty.</p>

The two rapporteurs have budgeted for the structural, administrative and logistical needs which the immense challenge of enlargement will very soon present us with.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2002 we are basically faced with two new structural needs originating from the Nice Summit and not foreseen in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one is caused by the failure of a Community policy, the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which obliges us to convert part of Portugal and Spain’s fishing fleets, with the great social impact of that conversion on many regions of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The other structural need derives from the very fact that enlargement is imminent. We must respond to the needs of the border regions of the Union, whose competitiveness is being weakened by the imminent application of the freedom of circulation of persons, goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the fact that the great majority of this Parliament understood both structural needs and supported a joint solution from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it has not been simple to respond to both demands. Until the conciliation meeting of 21 November it was not possible to agree on a satisfactory solution, and that means living with an excessive degree of risk.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important that we improve the degree of implementation of the appropriations agreed. Issues such as the entry into force of automatic failed commitments and the achievement of a level of payments which allows for the absorption of the leftovers are priorities which this Parliament is happy to have obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know which new structural needs we will have to deal with between now and 2006 and a degree of flexibility is therefore necessary within the spending categories, while always respecting the principle of maintaining the current financial perspectives which are now entering the third year of their difficult and eventful life.</p>
<p class="contents">This acceptance of the financial framework must not, however, lead us to forget how tight it is. This year Afghanistan and the Middle East are the issues which have once again created tension within heading 4. The problem is not the ends, but rather the means used by the Council to achieve them. Nobody disputes the needs of Afghanistan and the Middle East, as well as other international crises which may arise. But this Parliament does not agree with the Council’s way of doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is once again making financial commitments in external policy without taking account of Parliament’s political priorities, and furthermore it is doing so with non-obligatory expenses, which complicates even further the task of those Members who want to maintain the current financial framework. We would ask the Council whether it is really so difficult to establish a prior consultation system for external priorities in heading 5?</p>
<p class="contents">We take very good note of the words of the Commissioner on the possibility of improving the suitability of the legislative and budgetary procedures during next year and we truly welcome what he has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Carlos Costa Neves and also Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg, as well as Francesco Turchi on his report on the Trans-European networks. We would also like to congratulate Terence Wynn on his work as chairman. We believe that Commissioner Schreyer has found a good ally in this Parliament and that we have received good help from the Commissioner. We believe that it has been a good marriage of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to thank the Council for making the most difficult thing look easy, and that is being here when necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves, Mrs Buitenweg etc. They have not only sought broad solutions within Parliament but have also persistently maintained our positions in relation to the Council, something which has been especially important. I also want to thank the Council and the Commission. We have sometimes been critical about the forms, especially in connection with the first conciliation, but we nonetheless came up with a constructive approach in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been possible to solve a number of difficult issues. It is, of course, <span class="italic">incredibly</span> important that we have been able to produce substantial additional aid for Afghanistan, given the enormous needs that exist. Personally, I am delighted that we have been able to direct a portion of this aid to women’s involvement in constructing the future Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, there is satisfaction to be found in the fact that we came up with solutions both for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets and for aid to the border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that work on the budget has, then, proceeded well, we see a number of problems for the future. One of the biggest problems is that the EU budget is not flexible enough. Each year, we are witness to events in the world around us which require the EU to contribute resources without delay. In 2000, this was the case with Kosovo and in 2001 with Serbia, and now this year it is the case with Afghanistan. We have released funds for these unexpected situations, for example through the flexibility mechanism, but the process has been extremely difficult. Now, moreover, we are seeing its shortcomings for, this year, we had to use the flexibility mechanism for other, heading-2, aid. When, at the same time, a crisis like that in Afghanistan occurs, the problem becomes clear. Obviously, we ought, therefore, seriously to discuss the approach laid down in the interinstitutional agreement, namely that of revising the ceiling in the budget. The Council is steadfastly saying no to this, <span class="italic">in spite of </span>our having a budget, large amounts of which are never used. The problem, then, is that all that Parliament can do is account for every single krona in the budget, right up to the ceiling, and not allow for any margins for unforeseen events, or else cut back on other of its high priorities and thus let recipients of aid in other parts of the world in practice pay for our new needs in the Balkans or Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">We can naturally solve such a dilemma <span class="italic">once</span>, perhaps even twice, but when such initiatives tend to become permanent and when the situations in Kosovo, Serbia or Afghanistan give rise to multiannual programmes that pile up without the other needs disappearing, then the situation becomes untenable in the end. I believe that one of the major issues for next year will be that of finding new ways to increased flexibility. I therefore welcome the Commission’s ideas as a starting point for this discussion and hope that the Council will show a corresponding open-mindedness.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental error is, of course, the poor implementation of the EU’s budget. We have now launched a number of new methods, which are not only about increasing payments. Instead, we are trying to identify those areas we think of as lagging abnormally behind. We are trying to specify what is required of the implementation profile. We have conducted extensive discussions as to which services are required if we are to be able to implement initiatives in different policy areas. Finally, we have also, as Mr Wijkman pointed out, launched a new benchmarking method in the area of aid. These are important areas of progress, but I believe that they need to be developed further in future if we are to be able to win back people’s confidence in how we handle taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">As next year's rapporteur, I naturally see a number of important areas that have to be worked through. Enlargement is drawing ever nearer. During the preparations, we must, quite simply, consider not only the short-term perspective but also the long-term perspective when enlargement seriously makes itself felt in the budget too. Finally, we must also take a genuine look at reforming the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not succeed in this – and it is not only a question of reviewing the regulations but, above all, of looking at evaluation, follow-up and how we use taxpayers’ money – then I do not believe we shall succeed in changing people’s view of the EU. We must have effective administration and make sure that people regain their confidence in the European Union. That is one of the most important tasks for future work on the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Likewise, I wish to thank the second budget rapporteur, Kathalijne Buitenweg, and also, in particular, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terrence Wynn, for his skilful and constructive leadership of the Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for 2002 now being debated is a moderate and disciplined one. Appropriations have grown by just 2%, which is clearly below the figure for the financial perspectives. The European Parliament has shown an enormous sense of responsibility, which our group values highly. This budget is a considerable improvement on the Council’s first proposal. The agricultural budget is realistic. There are more funds available to cover outstanding commitments under categories 2 to 4, and there is a common call to use them to clear arrears. The reform of the Commission proceeds, and any expenditure that should not in fact arise, has been cut. We particularly appreciate the fact that no negative reserve, that is to say, no uncovered appropriation, has been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first reading of the budget some cuts were made to external actions, such as the western Balkans CARDS programme. Now we have been able to prevent most of these cuts. A total of 206.4 million euros is being proposed for the Balkans. Furthermore, the CARDS programme had already been given 63 million euros out of this year’s budget transfers, so all in all the programme is returning to what was proposed in the Council’s draft budget. This was immensely important for my group. For the Commission’s reform 317 posts are being reserved, which guarantees that the reform will proceed. Of these, 105 are in reserve, and our group hopes that at least the majority of them may still be released. A flexible instrument had to be adopted once again this year. A compromise decision was reached on its use, according to which Spain and Portugal will see the structure of their fisheries fleets revitalised with the aid of 170 million euros, plus another 27 million in 2003. Thirty million euros are to be spent on solving border problems associated with new Member States, with a further 15 million being spent on this next year. Our group supports all these decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission would have promised 197 million euros for the reconversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries fleets, which is a lot of money. In the same connection, the Nordic countries are demanding 50 million euros to resolve problems on their eastern borders. It was decided to finance these new needs with a flexible instrument under section 2, but over a period of two years. This new interpretation of the use of a flexible instrument shows that if there is the political will to finance something, the rules can definitely be bent.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU does not have a money shortage. That is evident from the financial statements for 2000. Furthermore, there will be a surplus of billions for this current year. There is 40 billion in outstanding commitments – the so-called ‘RAL’s – in the accounts, and it is to be supposed that most of it will never be spent. The Commission has saved money but it is questionable as to whether it has made any political decisions regarding savings. As there are such huge budget surpluses, the Commission has not implemented those budget decisions Parliament has made. To be perfectly frank, the Commission high-handedly invalidated the decisions of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">If the next EU year is evaluated from the point of view of the budget we might say that things are on an even keel, no rises and no falls. There are no special areas of focus, only running costs are funded from the budget.

This has proved invaluable time and again for those who have lived by it.</p>
<p class="contents">When we adopt the budget, it is crucial to set aside adequate reserves for unforeseen expenses. This was illustrated yet again this year. In this respect, the recent crisis in agriculture springs to mind in the first instance. Unfortunately, the Commission has abandoned its plans for a reserve in the sum of EUR 1 billion in the compulsory agriculture expenditure. In our view, the Commission’s argument for this U-turn borders on naivety and bears witness to a short-term view. Even if expenditure in terms of arable crops, dairy products, sugar, olive oil and mutton turns out higher than expected, expenses are far higher where vinicultural products and cotton are concerned. Our greatest frustration is the fact that BSE and foot and mouth no longer seem to feature in the Commission’s dictionary. Mr Görlach from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is right to remark on the underlying uncertainty as to the final end of the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom and other Member States, as well as animal transports and the inconsistent vaccination policy. Additionally, I share his fear that the BSE crisis is likely to be around for the foreseeable future. The recent confirmation of a case in Austria speaks for itself. How does the Commission intend to pay for unforeseen expenditure? Will we once again have to fiddle with the ceilings agreed in Berlin?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the flexibility instrument. It is striking that these resources, an annual amount of no less than EUR 200 million, have been fully used up ever since this instrument was created three years ago. I do not call into question the validity of the spending objectives to obtain funding. What bothers me is the financing method. Why do budget headings not receive a thorough overhaul for unspent amounts and unprofitable budget lines?</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament wants to be close to the citizen. It should therefore act as any sensible citizen – if it wants to pay for something new, there will have to be economies elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The roles played by the Commission, and indeed also by some Members, were in our view not always transparent. The acceding countries must not have large amounts of promotional funds made available to them whilst the frontier regions of our Member States get no additional funds at all. These regions' economic situation is often not much better than that in the acceding countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The poor economic situation in the frontier regions of the Member States may well get even worse after the new countries join the EU, because differing levels of funding – almost all get Objective 1 funding – will greatly favour the frontier regions of the acceding countries, some of which already possess better transport infrastructure than is to be found in the frontier regions of the Member States. As an example of this, I would mention the airport at Laibach in Slovenia, which is more modern and much better developed than the airport at Klagenfurt in Southern Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of the new states will, for the reasons I have mentioned, make it difficult, or almost impossible, to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions of the Member States. We must, though, be clear in our own minds that the citizens in these regions can hardly be in favour of the accession of new countries under these circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks are especially addressed to the Belgian Presidency of the Council, who took the concern of the regions' peoples on board and here provided the financial means it demands. Commissioner, I now of course expect the Commission to table proposals with all speed. You have demonstrated that you are in a position to do this where fisheries policy is concerned, and I hope that you will present programmes for the frontier regions within a comparable timescale, so that the money can be tied up as quickly as possible and be spent on the ground on worthwhile projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that we must, of course, ensure that political priorities and the Budget process are synchronised in the future. It was this morning that we first had the opportunity to acquaint ourselves with the Commission's political priorities for 2002. I find that quite unacceptable. The former Commission, which also had to step down because of problems with the Budget, was significantly quicker and more efficient than the present one when it came to setting priorities and discussing them with Parliament. As the Commission always needs some supplementary tuition, we will happily provide it. The best way of doing this is to keep in reserve those positions that the Commission urgently needs. I hope that will help to make the setting of political priorities and the Budget process go more in step with one another. I find it unacceptable that we should be told the political plans for the coming year only on the day we are debating the Budget at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also take the opportunity to thank Mr Turchi for his report on the Trans-European Networks. Here, too, I would like to ask the Commission to see to it that, where funds for stages or parts of networks are made available from the EU's Budget, care is also taken that the whole network is also constructed. Let me give just one example from my own country, the important transport link from Berlin to Verona via the Brenner Tunnel. The German federal government readily undertook to finance the construction of the stretch from Berlin to Erfurt, but struck the Erfurt-Nuremberg portion from its list of priorities. Now, either the money must be repaid, as a stage is no use on its own, or pressure must be brought to bear to get the next stage built.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by saying something about Parliament and its budget. I think it is a bit close to Christmas to be drawing up Christmas lists of possible new buildings that we will need if we are to have the space to cope with enlargement. I think there must be serious examination of whether there is real need for additional space for offices and meeting rooms. Christmas lists are nice, but the Christ child does not grant us all wishes, and nor should we. Let me thank everyone, the rapporteurs and especially the Belgian Presidency of the Council, for their cooperation. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my thanks to Carlos, Kathalijne, Francesco, Esko, Joane and Terry. It is they, of course, who have provided us with these documents for today’s debate, and I believe they have done an outstanding job. The result we shall obtain from all of this will be a very good one. Allow me at this point, I spoke out of turn last time, to address Mr Vande Lanotte, the representative of the Council. After Mrs Parly last year, you are the second President of the Council whom I shall remember with profound gratitude. If this trend continues in the coming years, if this level is consistently maintained, we shall yet manage to establish really close cooperation and mutual trust one of these days between the Council and Parliament. Keep an eye on us, Commissioner – you must treat us better, otherwise you will suddenly find that we are far more in tune with them than with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I wish to put to the President-in-Office, however, concerns Laeken. As I have already remarked, one of the things you will be discussing in Laeken, naturally enough, is the future structure of the European Union, and this discussion will not be confined to the question of a constitution in the sense of defining the structure and purpose of each component of the Union. No, we must also talk about the way in which we can achieve a budget that is transparent in every respect. It is impossible to explain to any of our citizens the fact that, having underspent various allocations by 4.6 billion euros, as the Commissioner said, we should be fighting for weeks and months here to obtain an extra 200 million or, when acute emergencies occur, that we actually have to push the entire budget back and forth to deal with them at the expense of our long-term strategies and basic political aims. We have had to make a large amount available for Afghanistan this year, and indeed it is very important that the people there do not merely see Europe as an authority that comes to punish but that they also experience Europe as a helper coming to assist them in their development. We have allocated aid to the fishing regions and aid to the border regions. This, too, was very important, because it signalled to the world that we are taking the current changes seriously and that we are restructuring in response to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me a brief remark in parenthesis. Time and again, as we all know, the cry from Bavaria has been that we need money for the border regions. These are the selfsame Bavarians who, on other occasions, denounce the system of revenue redistribution among the <span class="italic">Länder</span> and who, in CDU and CSU papers on structural issues, advocate the scrapping of all structural aid. On such occasions they turn round and demand a great deal more money. I have been a very fervent supporter of assistance for border regions and shall continue to support it, but those who beat the drum with high-powered press releases must ask themselves whether this is a consistent way to act.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have fundamental matters to deal with. We must forge ahead with the reform of the Commission, because we want a modern administrative system. We must forge ahead on <span class="italic">e-</span>learning, one of the areas with the highest growth potential in a developing economic area like the European Union, not only because we want to grasp our economic opportunities but also because we want to avoid a split within our populations between those who can afford to acquire computers at a very early stage and those who are excluded from the information society. We must cooperate more effectively in Europol and Eurojust to combat terrorism. We cannot have a situation in which the criminals are driving Ferraris and the police are trying to chase them in Fiat Unos! I mention these two makes of car deliberately, because they come from a certain country, a country that would do well to consider what it is doing to Europe at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the domain of foreign policy too, we must agree to tackle important issues. The Balkans must continue to receive attention. So must the Mediterranean region. But we must also heed the silent agony of the voiceless in the world. This is why we have been active this year in the struggle against AIDS. Silent agony, however, is easily neglected. We must keep closer watch. We must not wait to be rocked by violent explosions in the world. On the contrary, the European Union must become more sensitive, in cooperation with the regions of the world where our help is needed, especially to the need for food aid to ward off starvation but also to the need to help the countries in those regions to improve their administrative systems and infrastructure, thereby guaranteeing that those countries can develop by their own efforts in a manner which reflects credit on the quality and diligence of European cooperation with the rest of the world.</p>

There have been quite a few speakers here today who have stated that there are things in the budget process that could be done better and that the institutions should in future work better together, even though this budget has proceeded very peacefully under the expert direction of Parliament’s Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also think that, in certain areas, we should give some thought to how we act in Parliament. In next year’s budget, money has thus been set aside for early retirement and new appointments in order to ensure that the Commission obtains the right manpower for carrying out its tasks. In Parliament, we have demanded information as a condition of the appropriations, and the Commission has, on several occasions, reported in detail on the staffing situation. There is a majority in the Committee on Budgets that has wanted to place a large amount of money in reserve until further information has been provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we must be careful, in making our demands, that we are not too pedantic and do not require too much detail. Otherwise, we shall end up obstructing the reforms rather than promoting them. We must, of course, ensure that taxpayers’ money is managed efficiently and transparently, but I believe it is important for us to concentrate our attention more on results than on detailed management of the Commission’s administration, for that would not promote responsibility. I think that we in Parliament should honour the obligingness and openness shown by the Commission and either release those items that are in the reserve or at least be content to keep a smaller amount in the reserve so that the Commission obtains reasonable conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Berlin decisions still offer some scope, particularly since there is apparently no need to maintain the levy on the Member States at its present level. In the implementation of the budget for 2002, I expect the structural support funds for the development of rural areas to be spent in full and all surplus revenue to be reduced to zero before or during the year 2006 if possible, by ensuring that eligible projects are realised within the shortest possible time frame. In response to another complaint that I hear time and again, I also expect guarantees that enough flexibility will be shown for projects to be replaced if necessary.</p>

Naturally I also pay tribute to our rapporteurs and to the Commission for a budget that, in my view, is going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I have three comments to make. The first concerns the reform. In this context I must say that I am most disappointed, we as a Parliament are most disappointed with the various episodes of these past days. As the President, Mrs Schreyer, will know, I am not addressing her at this moment but the Commission in general, including its Vice-President Mr Kinnock. I think the kind of communication and exchanges of view we have seen over the past few days between the Commission and Parliament is not likely to help us take the decision we need to take this evening to unfreeze the budget items on reform, which is a pity.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw the attention of Members and in particular of the rapporteur to two points. It seems to me that yesterday the General Affairs Council buried the ‘European political parties’ heading. That means EUR 7 million are likely to be unusable for lack of a legal basis. I would ask the rapporteur whether we could vote differently on Thursday. Furthermore, in regard to the budget heading for north-south cooperation in combating drugs, the Commission has not really followed up that question. A report that should have been drawn up is not there. Here again we have entered money under this heading, which has no <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>.

<p class="contents">The Union is at a decisive stage of its history, which must be accompanied by budgets which are suited to the challenges we are facing. We must begin by acknowledging the fact that, if we want to promote the work of the Union and make it truly efficient, we should enter soon into a debate on the Union’s resources and the Community’s budgetary weight.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should point out that throughout the difficult negotiation, which has ended with a positive agreement, progress has been made in resolving problems which go beyond a particular budgetary year. The commitments made in the statements during the conciliation process represent a code of conduct which works in favour of transparency and greater efficiency in spending. It is therefore important during the next six-month period, under the Spanish Presidency, which has declared its intentions with regard to the financial Regulation, to reach a definitive agreement on this fundamental piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have responded to the problem created by the lack of a fisheries agreement with Morocco by compensating the Community fleets in Spain and Portugal and guaranteeing the funding of the necessary conversion and modernisation programmes both in the 2002 budget and in the current period, as the Commissioner has pointed out, and I thank her warmly for her commitment. But it is also necessary for this Parliament to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission on such important projects as the establishment of the European satellite navigation system, known as Galileo. At a time when there are doubts on the part of some Member States, we must make it clear that the programme must not be called into question and that this phase needs to be basically sustained by means of public funding, as the Turchi report demonstrates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, as we move towards the mid point of the period of the financial framework in force, the difficulties increase because the new demands, the new commitments, call on the budget without any financial coverage. Despite the difficulties and contradictions, I sincerely believe that, with the signing of this budget, the way ahead has been partly cleared. It is a political success because it is rigorous and is accompanied by guarantees of more efficient implementation, and these conditions are essential if we are to ensure healthy and sustainable economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that at first reading we were quite severe with the Commission about the reform. However, as you know, after the Commission’s replies we are quite prepared to give up these reservations, although there are still some points, two in particular, that bother us. Let me remind you of them. First there is the question of early retirement; up to now, and for several months now, we have had no reaction and seen no document that meets our expectations. The second point to which I would draw the attention of Parliament as a whole is the establishment of base management activity, with as its corollary the lack of any reliable response from the Commission on the application of coherent legislative and budgetary procedures with a view to drawing up our next budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that we would not be so concerned if the administrative reform had been accompanied by an even more revolutionary reform, that is, a much more satisfactory system of interinstitutional relations with a view to drawing up the budgets. I must tell you that if the Council could reply in time, coherently and on a reasoned basis to the questions we or the Commission put to it, we could make progress on every front. Above all, if the Commission implemented in a reliable manner the budgets we as the budgetary authority adopt, believe me, Parliament would not hesitate today and would find it easier to give a vote of confidence and to abandon many of its reservations, especially those relating to the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">You may be sure that Parliament continues to spearhead the reform with a view to modernising the administration; but then the Commission must also give us proof of its serious resolve to reform the working procedures between our two institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, should like to congratulate all those involved in this budgetary procedure, which, as far as I can see, was an excellent procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">We greatly appreciate the fact that amendments tabled by Parliament to compulsory agricultural expenditure have been adopted under the Belgian Presidency for the first time. It is somewhat regrettable that the Commission has failed to seize the opportunity to include Parliament’s proposal in the letter of amendment at this stage. In the light of the foot and mouth crisis, it is crucial for the European Union to do something about the development of marker vaccines and of insurance systems against animal diseases. I only hope now that the Commission will implement the amendments to this budget, for in the past I have had certain doubts in this respect. </p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments which have not been included unfortunately, but which are of major importance, in my view, are the amendments which relate to the quality policy for agricultural products. This then refers to a quality heading other than the purely organic production. I hope that the amendment will be adopted and that the Commission will implement it accordingly this time. </p>
<p class="contents">Of great concern is still the fact that a large number of amendments are left over, of which the Commission had said before that it was unable or not prepared to implement them. There is every chance that these amendments will be adopted on Thursday nevertheless. What will the Commission do in that case? Will it persist in its attitude or will it bow to the wishes of the budgetary authority? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have no problem about telematics being included in such a programme and I generally support the Galileo project. But the fact is that nearly EUR 1 billion is committed over the next five years, all from the public sector – from either the European Space Agency or from the Commission itself. By contrast, only EUR 200 million is allocated to the project by the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">My amendment therefore says that it is doubtful whether the private sector will come up with the goods early enough. I ask for a reserve of half the money allocated by the Commission for the first year of the funding to be set aside and released only if the private sector signs up to its commitments to take part in this project. I do not want to smash the project. I know there are heated discussions in the Council, and many nations have withdrawn their support for now, or are a bit uncertain. That is not my agenda. I just want to make sure the private sector comes to the party early enough to make sure there is more confidence in the scheme as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two problems do not just affect two nations but have Europe-wide repercussions. I therefore ask the Commission once again to provide a better definition of the concept of cross-border area and region. For us socialists, a cross-border region, which should be included in the pilot project and other measures, is one which forms a border by land or by sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, regret certain cuts, in the case of the Balkans for example, but I am also pleased with the success achieved in MEDA recovery. In this regard, I hope the Commission will give priority to the regional dimension of the partnership provided for within this programme. I must also express my satisfaction with <span class="italic">e-</span>learning, Socrates, Leonardo, Europol, Eurojust and the Global Help Fund. Thanks also to Mr Turchi for his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The projects approved at Essen must be speeded up; the individual States must be involved more, but the space for the great networks linking North and South must also be increased.

Mr Colom i Naval suggested that the agreed amounts which are laid down in the multiannual programme should be index-linked. The Commission cannot endorse this view, because these appropriations must be adopted as absolute amounts. If we then have a different inflation rate, that naturally creates more leeway in Category III, which such a situation will quite obviously require, and of which Parliament will rightly avail itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Many comments related to the implementation of the budget. May I simply remind the House that a new instrument has been in place this year through which Parliament has been able to take part in the monitoring process, namely the weekly implementation figures issued by the Commission. This is the only Parliament that is kept so well abreast of the day-to-day expenditure situation. The Parliaments of the Member States do not have such an instrument. This is a genuine innovation, and we should certainly maintain it. For you, of course, it is a very important source of information, enabling you to observe how implementation is proceeding. I believe that what we have set down in the resolution is another important step towards close cooperation as part of a sound implementation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point that was raised in many of your contributions concerns the flexibility of the budget as a whole. How rigid is this system that the Financial Perspective gives us? It is undoubtedly noteworthy that this year, for the first time, the Council consented almost immediately to the use of flexibility instruments, of the flexibility reserve, in the budget. This really shows how important it is to have a balancing instrument, a fine-tuning instrument. But of course we must also ask the question whether that in itself is sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the third year of the Financial Perspective. Much of what we have to do here together, it must be said, raises budgeting almost to the level of an art form. This is the third year that we have launched the budget together. I do believe we can be content once again with the result, which certainly stands up to scrutiny. On behalf of the Commission, I should like to repeat my sincere thanks to everyone who has been involved in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
