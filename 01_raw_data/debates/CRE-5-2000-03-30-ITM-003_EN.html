<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come before you here today to make a statement on European Patent No EP 69 53 51 which was granted by the European Patent Office to the University of Edinburgh on 8 December 1999. After the granting of this patent, a number of concerns have been raised, both here in Parliament and also by organisations such as Greenpeace, about the true scope of this patent.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I should like to say that the Commission shares these concerns. It seems clear to everyone involved that this patent should not have been granted in the form it was. The European Patent Office has issued a press statement to that effect. I know that there have been some among you here today who believe that the European Patent Office has, at best, been economical with the truth or at worst has sought to seriously mislead the public. You have a joint motion before you today which includes such charges.</p>
<p class="contents">May I point out that the European Patent Office is not a Community body; its existence and its actions are derived from an international agreement to which all the Member States of the European Union and four other countries are a party, but not the Community itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I cannot give you authoritative information on the actions of the European Patent Office in this particular case. However, given my experience of the European Patent Office, which I visited in Munich recently, I personally should be very surprised if this unfortunate occurrence was anything other than a mistake during the examination process.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of the cause of the problem, it is clear, as I have mentioned just now, that the patent should not have been granted in its current form. Therefore the question is: what does the Commission intend to do about it? That is the reason why I am here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion before you calls on Parliament itself and the other institutions of the European Union formally to oppose this patent within the 9-month period during which an opposition is allowed under the rules governing the granting of European patents.</p>
<p class="contents">Some oppositions to this patent have already been filed. However, if the European Patent Office follows its usual rules for oppositions then this is unlikely to bring any changes to this patent before December 2000 and perhaps even later than that. Such a delay in correcting what is, in effect, an admitted error, is clearly undesirable. I have therefore written to the European Patent Office in Munich requesting that it should explore every possibility to bring about a speedier resolution of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that the European Patent Office has agreed, given the particular nature of this case, to form a so-called opposition body immediately, an opposition body which will, shortly after having been constituted, issue a first communication indicating a preliminary opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the European Patent Office said that such a preliminary opinion will be without prejudice to the final ruling of the opposition division in this case. But the Office assures me that proceedings will speedily lead to conclusions, subject to respecting the rights of the parties to be heard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that, like me, Members of this assembly, Mr President, will welcome this willingness on the part of the European Patent Office to respond to some of the concerns raised by this Parliament and as a direct result of the approach taken by the Commission. I am happy to make available to you, President, copies of both my letter to the European Patent Office and its reply to the Commission. Of course, I shall inform you, as soon as possible, about the conclusions which the legal service of the Commission will formulate having studied precisely the reply of the European Patent Office to the letter which I sent it recently</p>
<p class="contents">Let me therefore conclude by reiterating that the Commission, like everyone else, regrets that this patent has been granted in its present form. We have taken action which – based upon the full cooperation of the European Patent Office – will, I believe, bring about a speedy resolution of this unfortunate occurrence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a flagrant violation of human dignity. The event shows how important it was for the European Parliament, in debating the directive on the patenting of biotechnological inventions, to have made it a cornerstone of the directive that there can be no question of patenting techniques for cloning human beings and for manipulating human genetic material, still less of patenting the human being in all phases of his development. </p>
<p class="contents">Many people said at the time that these clarifications were quite unnecessary and that a patent of this kind would never be granted anyway. We now see how important these clarifications were. The European Patent Office has incorporated the European Union’s directive into its own directives. It is not, in fact, bound directly by the Council’s and Parliament’s directive but has incorporated word for word what we decided upon at the time into its implementing rules. What has happened in this connection is therefore a flagrant breach of the European Patent Office’s own rules. </p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I feel any sympathy or understanding for those who say that, oh, there was nothing very untoward about the granting of this patent, that we should not be getting so worked up about it and that, what is more, the technique in question may potentially have a lot to offer. Then, there was a press statement from Europabio, which was not very helpful in this regard and, following which, I wrote a letter to the chairman of Europabio pointing out that such an ambivalent position on the patent involved was not at all helpful in furthering people’s understanding of biotechnology. It must also meet with vigorous protest in the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not, however, a question of the directive we adopted in 1998 being a bad one. It is a question of its needing to be applied better. There has been a breach of this directive, and we ought not, therefore, to bring the directive into question but instead to make sure that the directive is applied both in the European Patent Office and also through being transposed into national law. We stated clearly at the time that we are in favour of biotechnology and approve of the opportunities it presents, but we want to see clear, ethically based limits. </p>
<p class="contents">There is also something else which requires clarification. The European Parliament has always taken a clear stand, not only against the patenting of techniques which violate human dignity, but also against such techniques themselves. Parliament has always repudiated the cloning of human beings, the manipulation of human genetic material and the use of embryos in research. Take, for example, Mr Tannert’s report on the relevant research programme in these areas. The Group of the European People’s Party has therefore tabled Amendment No 4 in order once again to make it clear that we are not going back on this. We shall, in any case, vote in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament must send out a clear signal in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As soon as the course of events became known, my group tabled an oral question on the matter in order to obtain clarification of the questions of principle which had been raised and of the inevitable consequences. However, the question disappeared without trace in the course of this House’s business. Instead of the required answers, we have today received an explanation from the Commission which cannot be the last word as far as the European Parliament is concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">Why do I mention this? Quite simply because this dreadful patent and the run-up to it, together with the disappearance of a parliamentary question, show how we ought not to deal with biotechnology, that is to say in a careless and slipshod manner. That would lead to a disastrous situation in which the principles of the inviolability of the human being and of human dignity would be completely lost. Clearly, everything must be done in order to completely do away with Patent No EP 69 53 51 and any similar gaffes. Clearly we must move as quickly as possible to close the legal loophole constituted by the flawed European patent. Clearly, we must quickly create a route to independent patent jurisdiction which is open to everyone. Or do we want further to abandon a powerful authority to a form of self-monitoring which still does not even begin to operate satisfactorily? </p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the development of biotechnology and of all new techniques must be subject to increased public supervision. In this way, the European Parliament is confronted with a special task requiring the preparation of an annual report on the work of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies. It is just as clear to my group and to myself that the genetic inheritance of humanity must remain common property and should not be sold off on the floor of the stock exchange. </p>
<p class="contents">We only use biotechnology in a responsible way when we respect its ethical limits and make the genetic code accessible to researchers throughout the world. Finally, it must be made unequivocally clear once and for all that our Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions excludes not only the patentability of the human being, of parts of the human genetic make-up and of interference with the genome, but also forbids the cloning of human beings at all phases of their development. Moreover, everyone must adhere to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Clercq (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament is right to be concerned, and this is surely an understatement, by the fact that the European Patent Office has granted a patent to the University of Edinburgh. We are simply conveying the concerns, fears and confusion felt by the general public. However, the European Parliament has already clearly formulated its position on this delicate matter. I would draw your attention to two elements.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the biotechnology directive. As you are aware, a clear position was taken up in this directive after long, searching and, on occasions, heated discussion, during which all stances, opinions and interests were voiced, following which the said directive received Parliament’s definitive approval at second reading in 1998. Incidentally, this was also an issue where, perhaps for the first time, Parliament showed what it was capable of and truly stood on its authority. The outcome is a balanced text that affords science the opportunity to make progress, but in the interests and service of humanity. A number of items are unequivocally excluded from patenting in this directive, such as the human body, for example, or parts thereof at all stages of development, as per Article 3, and the cloning of human beings, as per Article 9.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is clear that this registered patent cannot go through. That is also why Parliament is well advised to react firmly. It is for these reasons that not only will the ELDR Group endorse the motion, it will also support Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 8 and 9, because they clearly reinforce the message conveyed by the directive in question.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament has already pointed out on a number of occasions that we are lacking a uniform European patent, as it has repeatedly condemned the fact that there are gaps in European patent legislation. The situation has reared its head again, as you will see from paragraph 5 of the draft resolution. I refer to the amendment that I submitted and that was unanimously approved by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, relating to the very issue of our need for a European patent. This amendment also pushes for a European patent of this kind to be drafted swiftly, attempts to do so having failed hitherto on account of the costs associated with the translation problem. Just imagine that! Well, we will be able to “avoid regrettable misunderstandings”, as the European Patent Office would put it, once we have found a definitive solution to the problems attending European patent law, and have cleared such misunderstandings up, because, at the end of the day, prevention is still better than cure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It amounts to deliberately awarding a patent for the breeding of human beings. The genetically modified human being would himself be degraded to the status of a product of genetic technology, and that would be a flagrant affront to human dignity. We are therefore delighted that, in its motion for a resolution, Parliament has taken up the proposal tabled by the Greens to the effect that we, as a Parliament, should submit a complaint to the Patent Office in Munich and that Parliament should join us in our criticism of the structural problems of the European Patent Office, because if transparency and an ethical approach are to be allowed to come into their own, we require independent supervision of the European Patent Office. This patent is no isolated case, however. It is only the tip of the iceberg or a Pandora’s box which has been open for a long time. The Patent Office has awarded a whole range of patents on human genetic make-up and thus breached the regulations of the European Patent Agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">Parts of the human genetic make-up have, quite intolerably, been declared to be, and commercialised as, the invention and the property of third parties. We must vehemently oppose this commercialisation of human genes and these flagrant violations of human dignity. This also means, however, that we need to investigate the patenting of parts of the human genetic make-up and of genes themselves, which is also made possible by the directive on patenting. That is because we need a moratorium on the patenting of human genes and of parts of the human genetic make-up so that its social and ethical consequences, which are now everywhere to be seen, can be examined. For this patent must be a lesson and also a last warning to us to the effect that we really have to adopt a different approach in dealing with this issue. I would also have expected more from the Commission today in terms of more criticism and also of more questions about the background to the directive on patenting which also virtually legitimises past practice on the part of the Patent Office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also delighted that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – and I want to thank Mr Liese – has adopted Article 1 of our motion for a resolution as an amendment, reaffirming the primacy of the dignity of human life over any considerations of research or profit.</p>
<p class="contents">In their defence the officers of the Patent Office refer to the language problem. But the English wording of the patent undermines that explanation because Article 11 explicitly mentions that the term ‘animal’ includes all animal cells, especially of mammalian species, including human cells. So that seems to contradict the linguistic explanations given by the Office and the fear remains that the mistake is not just a technical one, as they apparently want to make out.</p>
<p class="contents">An inquiry to identify responsibility for such a mistake is essential, sanctions must be applied and, above all, adequate measures must be taken by the Member States of the European Patents Convention and the Office itself to prevent such incidents recurring. But it is not just a matter of applying the legal rules in force in the Union, or indeed those of the Office itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of defending the dignity of the human being, from conception to natural death. We know very well that cloning is an attack on that dignity, especially when it involves embryonic reduction in the secrecy of laboratories. We know the creation of clones to provide healthy cells for the benefit of the original is an affront to that dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Each person is unique; there is something sacred in each human being. The contempt for human beings, and life generally, that now exists can only feed the worst excesses of irresponsible scientists. It is a good thing that, at least for the space of a short debate, we have remembered everyone’s fundamental right to their own unique identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not intend to comment on whether it was in fact a matter of translation error, as is being suggested, or intentional. The office has at least admitted that the patent was granted erroneously.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes the view that had the directive on patenting biotechnological inventions been transposed in good time, this error could have been avoided. I dispute this.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it would not have been permitted for the patent to be granted on the basis of national patent law either. Secondly, I doubt whether the directive is as unambiguous as the Commission seems to think it is. The directive has not yet been implemented in my own country, the Netherlands. This is because the Netherlands has submitted a request for annulment of this directive to the Court of Justice, citing its “internal inconsistency”, among other factors. </p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to eliminate all ambiguity and loopholes in the directive. The European Group of Ethics must also investigate if it actually affords human dignity adequate protection.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Respect for human beings, animals and plants in God’s Creation is of decisive importance for our society. The Commission is deceiving itself if it believes that implementing the directive will put an end to all the uncertainty. The tension between economic interests and ethical considerations in the directive will continue to provoke discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first place, at this stage, it is in the general interest to avoid patents being issued on human chromosomes, in order not to close any doors to the endeavours of scientific research to find new treatment methods and to use knowledge gained about the human genome to improve health, which is an end that should be placed over and above the albeit legitimate protection of the economic interests of researchers. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a deficiency in the law: it is not possible for the European Patent Office not to have any links with the Commission or be part of the structure of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and most importantly, we are considering an issue which is at the very root of our civilisation. Christianity has taught us the value of the dignity of every human being; the tradition of the left enshrines the concept that the human person, man, is not a commodity and cannot be treated as such. Well, we are now clearly running the risk of turning human beings into commodities, at least in part, and this affects the very roots of our civilisation – in terms of Christianity and also of the enlightenment and Marxism. We must be united, determined and resolute in our reaction, remembering that the embryo is a unique human being. Whatever our attitude to abortion, even those of us who consider abortion to be lawful have always agreed on one point: the right of the mother prevails over the right of the embryo, but the right of the embryo does exist. It yields solely and exclusively before the right of the mother, not before the right of a multinational to make money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council should give the Commission the mandate to do this. In justification of this, I would point out that it must be the Commission’s job to enforce the directive on bio-patents. It is debatable whether this directive, for which I was the rapporteur, is in fact a suitable tool for managing the problems involved. It would have been helpful if whoever was giving vent to his indignation had taken the trouble to read the patent. He would then have seen that the patent infringes the directive on bio-patents on two counts, firstly because the patent protection extends to include a procedure for modifying human genetic material and, secondly, because the patent protection extends to include the use of embryos for commercial and industrial purposes. These are two clear infringements of the directive on bio-patents. </p>
<p class="contents">How one might now use this as an opportunity to again cast doubt upon the directive without having read the patent or the directive, I really cannot imagine. Hence, my request to Parliament to the effect that we should not again cast doubt upon the directive, as Mrs Breyer thinks we have to. This is, in fact, the first text in the world to offer a satisfactory solution to the problems involved in patent protection and bio-technological inventions and, what is more, the first text in the world to win universal approval. It is now, therefore, a question not of again bringing the directive into question but of enforcing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, after all, one of my own country’s most distinguished universities. When they sought and obtained this patent, which they did for entirely lawful purposes, they did so in good faith. They have no interest in cloning humans: rather what they are interested in is being able to work on human tissue to help find remedies for, for example, Alzheimer’s Disease and leukaemia and what they are doing breaks no law in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been explained, the patent in question was examined prior to the coming into effect of the 1998 directive in September 1999, but it was issued after that date and, as has been said, a mistake was made in the form in which it was granted. I have seen no evidence at all at this stage of anything more than error on the part of the Patent Office. Of course, I would like to add that that is something which is of serious concern. But until there is something more, I think it appropriate that the wilder claims and suggestions should be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">My understanding is that the patent error can be corrected either by the patent owner applying to correct the document or by a third party filing an opposition which I understand has already been done. I have been told by the university’s advisors that it will not resist so long as the disclaimer which may be added to the patent continues to allow them to carry out their lawful work on human tissue. In other words, what we are talking about here is an amendment to cut out the offending elements of the patent, thereby rendering it lawful, and not its revocation in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the work which is being carried out in Edinburgh is not permitted by national law in some other Member States. But what this Parliament and the Community institutions and international bodies should not do is attempt to legislate for national parliaments in areas which are national competences, and in my view any attempt to do so should be resisted strongly as a matter of overriding constitutional principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps you will allow me to pass a few comments on what the various Members of this Parliament have said.</p>
<p class="contents">May I begin by saying in reply to Mr Rothley that indeed the Commission has reserved to itself the right to oppose the patent in a formal way. As I have said earlier this morning, I wrote a letter on behalf of the Commission to the European Patent Office. I have no objection whatsoever to making that letter public. The penultimate paragraph reads as follows: “In this context, I have to inform that the College of Commissioners has already decided to take more formal action, notably to file an opposition by the Commission or the Community in case no pragmatic solution can be reached”.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, whereas we prefer a negotiated settlement because it will be quicker than the nine months which is foreseen by the Patent Office rules, we have retained for ourselves the right formula to oppose the patents if no progress is made along this quicker route. So, as far as that goes, Mr Rothley may rest assured that the Commission has reserved that right to itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should then like to support Mr Liese who has emphasised that there is nothing wrong with the directive. I agree with him. I think that the directive is a good one. Indeed, Mr Rothley himself has said that the directive is the first of its kind in the world and that it has received universal acclaim.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly if I look at paragraph five of the directive where it says that certain processes are not to be considered patentable, then it seems to me that the directive is perfectly clear. Mr Blokland has said that the directive is unclear and inconsistent and certainly the Commission will be very interested in a substantiated view of that statement.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also mentioned by Frau Gebhardt that the cloning of human beings should be forbidden. Well, President, it is forbidden. May I draw the attention of Mrs Gebhardt to the fact that the directive specifically forbids that. It seems to me that that is all we need to do, provided, of course, that the directive is properly applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The last issue I should like to deal with is the matter of the Community patent. Several speakers this morning have spoken about the European patents. Now, a European patent is what the European Patent Office grants. The proper term to use is a Community patent. In other words it is one application made to the European Patent Office in Munich but that office would then grant a Community patent and that would apply at one go to the whole European Union. We are working on that. I should like to say to Frau Gebhardt and Mr De Clercq who mentioned this that we are certainly working hard at realising the possibility of having a Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not an easy thing, principally because the European Patent Office is not a Community institution. So what we want the European Patent Office to do is something on behalf of the European Commission while the Office itself is not a Community institution. That presents us with certain legal problems and we are trying to solve them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed true that the language problems are considerable. The average cost of a patent is about EUR 30 000, much higher than in the United States, and that is because 40% of those costs are taken up by language problems – the translation costs – and we are trying to get to grips with that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is the intention of the Commission to issue a document to substantiate the construction of a European patent before the summer and I look forward to entering into a dialogue with Parliament on the substance of that document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
