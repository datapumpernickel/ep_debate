<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alain Lipietz (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to examine a report that, for the first time ever, is taking on a political dimension. In the 2005 referenda debates on the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the notions of an area of free and open competition – as it is currently referred to – or undistorted competition – as it would have been referred to if the treaty on the European Constitution had been adopted – were at the centre of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problem is to prove now that competition policy can serve the people, that it must serve the people and that it already serves the people. There is broad consensus on this point within our committee but, from the moment when I, as rapporteur, had to highlight obvious cases that required a reassessment or a reorientation of competition policy or that, on the contrary, called for competition policy strongly to be encouraged, disagreements arose.</p>
<p class="contents">In its current, post-amendment, state, the report is characteristic of the European Parliament’s reports, which practically no one can, or wants to, read because they say absolutely nothing at all. I hope that, on at least three points, forceful ideas are reaffirmed in order to show the people that the European institutions are there to serve them.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition policy is divided into three broad areas: the fight against the formation of monopolies, the fight against cartels and the fight against State aid that is illicit or harmful to healthy and undistorted competition. I will take these three examples and I will propose forceful ideas to you on these policies, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the fight against monopolies: the European Union’s policy has been admirable in its struggle against Microsoft’s abuse of its dominant position. My committee, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chose not to support the Directorate-General for Competition in this fight. I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to reaffirm the European Parliament’s support for the Directorate-General for Competition and for the Commission in the trial of strength they are conducting in relation to Microsoft.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will address the formation of these monopolies and the fight against cartels. Overall, the Directorate-General for Competition has behaved admirably. I am thinking, in particular, of the Vivendi/Hachette affair. I believe that, in an attempt to do things too quickly, mistakes were inadvertently made in 1999 during the merger between Rhône-Poulenc and Hoechst. We need to try to understand how these mistakes came about. We do not have the right to cancel the measures taken by the Commission, and I do not want this, but I am calling for a committee of inquiry to investigate what happened in order to understand how tens of thousands of employees and tens of thousands of small shareholders came to be ruined due to the Commission’s failure to carry out checks, despite the fact that it had committed itself to doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point on which I am calling on you to intervene and to voice forceful ideas concerns the field of public aid. The Directorate-General for Competition and the 2004 report approve of this aid when it is consistent with the Gothenburg policy and the Lisbon policy. We must support the Directorate-General for Competition on this point. When, however, the Directorate-General for Competition supports the town of Charleroi’s giving generous subsidies to the airline Ryanair, I believe that it must be criticised because that kind of action distorts competition between towns, between businesses and between modes of transport in a way that is detrimental to the Lisbon and Gothenburg policies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that there are a number of points on which I have to thank the rapporteur for giving the credit to the Commission and its services.</p>
<p class="contents">As you note, competition policy must help drive EU competition, competitiveness and growth and, as the rapporteur mentioned, in the end it should all work in favour of the consumers – what he called the ordinary people.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Parliament follows competition policy developments closely and proactively. Our valuable debate in February on state aid reform is a very good example. I will continue to involve you fully in policy development, even if the Treaty does not give this House a legislative role in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has also been an ardent and consistent supporter of the Commission’s work to enforce the competition rules fairly, firmly and effectively, as rightly mentioned by the rapporteur – whom I thank for that. I agree with your comments on many issues: the anti-trust reforms implemented in 2004; the coordination of the European competition network; European Competition Days; international cooperation; and of course consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">On private damage actions for breach of the EC anti-trust rules, I look forward to Parliament’s review of our Green Paper. We are continuing to work on the review of Article 82 of the Treaty, on areas of importance for the information society and on the sector inquiries, where I take your point about the areas in which our methodology could be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to a couple of specific points touched on by the rapporteur, we have discussed Altmark at length before, and the Commission will provide guidance when adopting decisions on individual cases. I have no indication in relation to questioning the behaviour of the national competition authorities as regards national incumbents, but would remind you that, if such a case arose, the Commission can intervene and deal with the case itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have two comments in response to Mr Lipietz. First, the Commission’s handling of the Hoechst/Rhône-Poulenc merger in 1999 and 2004 has been discussed at length and in detail during the committee meetings when this report was being prepared. The Commission has provided detailed responses to all the points raised. I do not think that any new factors have been brought forward. So, as far as I am concerned, that is behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission decided that some of the aid granted to Ryanair at Charleroi was compatible with the common market in the context of transport policy.

<p class="contents">I think it is the general view that the report has been improved by a number of the amendments made and I want to focus quickly on some of them: the emphasis on consumers, with specific proposals adding that we support the idea of private competition and enhancing the role of the consumer liaison officer. We welcome the first year of implementation of the process of reform undertaken by the Commission and we are also looking forward to the completion of the Article 82 approach – the interpretation of which is currently the subject of consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, propose to go through all the provisions in the report in detail. I just want to say that, in welcoming, for instance, the sectoral inquiries that have been launched, I draw attention to the aim of the Commission and of Commissioner Kroes to tackle protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I make no apology for highlighting something of great concern to all of us, which has arisen since this report was drawn up, and that is the vote that has recently taken place in the United States Senate to extend the process for dealing with merger cases in a way which amounts to blatant US protectionism. In my view, this amendment of the rules of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States could place new and damaging restrictions on foreign investments. Those are not my words, but the words of six of the leading financial services institutions in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner, along with her colleagues, has been working very closely with the US Government to deal with issues of regulatory cooperation. I have in front of me a copy of the agreement of last December. Item 8 of this states: ‘We – that is the US Government and the Commission – agree to discuss any significant remaining obstacles to transatlantic investment that the other party identifies, and will consider how to address and reduce such obstacles with a view to promoting closer transatlantic economic integration’.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the proposals in the United States strike a blow against that proposition and I would say that it is so serious that the Commissioner should make it clear to her counterparts in the United States that if they proceed in this way then retaliatory measures in Europe may be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It offers the opportunity to highlight the most important milestones, to consolidate the accumulated acquis and to enhance it on the basis of the experience we have acquired over the period and with a view to the future. In this regard, I believe that Mr Lipietz has been a genuinely effective rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would like to begin by saying how pleased I am that, since 1 May 2004, the competition policy has been extended to ten new countries as a result of enlargement and that the authorities of the new members have been integrated into the Network of Competition Authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">After the elections, Parliament issued its opinion on the investiture of the new Commission, which included a new Commissioner responsible for Competition.</p>
<p class="contents">An active and growing role for Parliament gives more legitimacy and transparency to the implementation of the competition policy, as has been becoming clear. Parliament’s repeated aspiration to be given codecision powers is well justified.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2004, the Commission completed its modernisation package. It has improved the guarantees of its procedures and has promoted initiatives in the field of the information and communication society. It has tackled secret agreements and abuses of dominant positions and has also controlled mergers and State subsidies. We have been keen to stress the importance of these actions and express our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have also detected shortcomings and weaknesses in the report, such as the lack of an assessment of the effects of the most important decisions on State subsidies and mergers, the treatment of services of general interest, the problems of collective negotiation in sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, the promotion of international cooperation, including with the emerging and developing countries, or the role of consumers in a genuine competition culture. The final resolution will be more complete if it reflects all of these aspects, so that they may be given the attention they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The competition policy is fundamental to the success of the Lisbon Strategy and achieving the growth and employment objectives. The resolution we adopt will be of more value if it reflects this reality, the strategic role and the potential of the European Competition Network and will be stronger if it establishes two clear guidelines: that the Commission should focus on issues that are relevant to our citizens, to improving their living conditions, and that it should act proactively, anticipating and promoting changes rather than simply reacting to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Press reports since then, concerning attempts at compliance, have presented conflicting information.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first time that progress, and even the right of defence prior to hearings or to appeal, seems to have been compromised by the Commission denying undertakings access to full information or evidence against them. In effect, undertakings are told: you must do more, but no, you cannot have the evidence and we will not tell you exactly what we want. Is such lack of transparency necessary, useful or, taken to its extreme, even in line with the principles of justice that one associates with an advanced democratic community?</p>
<p class="contents">With some reservations, I welcome the Article 82 consultation, which draws on recent experience, but it seems to me that there should also be more consultation with regard to Commission procedures and Regulation (EC) No 773/2004. This should include comparison with other countries, including the United States, keeping our aim of fostering a competitive business and investment environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Microsoft case is particularly difficult because it includes interoperability in a highly technical field. It is very important to define the general procedures for interoperability and it is with some regret that we lost those in the CII Directive. However, the general procedures for interoperability must not be defined by a hard case. Hard cases make bad law, and at present it is even difficult to reconcile the proposals in the consultation document – such as paragraphs 238, 239 and 240 – both with themselves and with the apparent demands on Microsoft. There are also further concerns in paragraph 242, concerning trade secrets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ability to launch new companies and to mount a challenge to old, existing companies is what has created European well-being and prosperity. It is therefore perfectly legitimate and extremely important to defend competition policy against all those forces that, in various ways, wish to introduce protectionism. As is also apparent from the report we are debating, there are a couple of tasks in this connection in which the Commission has an especially important role.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to debate competition issues from the perspective of the internal market as a whole. That is a step we must take because, if we are to obtain global champions, we must also ensure that we are able to obtain large and energetic European companies that operate across borders and that can also be players on the global stage. This requires a new competition policy that is in various ways an advance on the old one. I think, then, that the Commission must act vigorously and be unswervingly loyal in implementing the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">By that, I mean that it must take vigorous action in respect of those sections of the internal market in which Member States do not comply with what is required of them. This applies to issues in relation to telecommunications, in which we have seen how the industry has prospered as a result of the deregulation of competition, and it is important that all sectors of the economy benefit in the same way. Energy issues are another case in point, and I welcome the fact that, from what I have understood from the media, the Commission will act vigorously to bring about an internal market and to combat the protectionism we see today when it comes to various company mergers.</p>
<p class="contents">The last task is the one also discussed by Mr Evans, namely that of ensuring that we obtain a transatlantic competition policy that is reciprocal and that invigorates the whole of the transatlantic economy. In saying that, I also wish to emphasise that it is competition and competition policy that are the strongest forces behind European integration today, weaving our economies together and giving us new jobs.</p>

As such, it is important that this Parliament ensures that free and undistorted competition remains genuinely free and undistorted and that, when matters deserve to be looked into a little more closely, this can be done, including in this Chamber, whether it is a question of Microsoft, of Rhodia-Rhône-Poulenc or of Ryanair-Charleroi. </p>
<p class="contents">Given, Commissioner, that you are going to reopen the debate on, among other things, the important concept of mergers, which plays a key role in competition policy, I should like to draw your attention to one point, in the hope that this Parliament will support us on this issue. It seems to us that the threshold criteria that are already in force within the Commission prevent it from declaring its competence each time that it ought to. On the subject, for instance, of the alignment of the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse, you were not competent in the end because the turnover in question lay below the thresholds. These are grounds here for a real investigation. </p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns the Mittal-Arcelor affair. Does free and undistorted competition imply that the ownership conditions of the businesses in question should be left completely to one side? It seems to me that this is also a matter for serious thought.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my final point: you will not be surprised to hear that, as far as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is concerned, competition policy is only meaningful if it contributes to the Lisbon Strategy. It must integrate social objectives, environmental objectives and long-term objectives. I hope that, in this way, we will succeed in rebalancing the concept of free and undistorted competition so that the Union actually becomes the most competitive area in the world, while honouring the need for full employment and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is right to give your competition policy centre stage, because politicians should not, where specific cases are concerned, step into the shoes of the Commissioner or even the judge. In fact, it appears that some fellow Members find it difficult not to do so, but in the report that is the subject of today’s discussion, your competition policy is central.</p>
<p class="contents">The setting up of the European competition network is an important development and I call on the Commission to improve the exchange of information between the national competition authorities within it, thus ensuring that unity in the implementation of European competition policy continues to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to urge the Commission to speed up the last section of the modernisation operation, namely Article 82 on the abuse of dominant economic position. In that respect, I should like to stress the importance of policy that gives ample consideration to the market structure and does not, as is currently the case, focus all its attention on the market share of a certain undertaking. After all, globalisation has changed the world, and large undertakings with a considerable market share, which, for example, make important contributions in the field of innovation, must not simply be judged by their dominant position, but must be seen in a broader economic context. I hope that, where Article 82 is concerned, you will do justice to this in the policy you will be presenting in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It so happens that I took a keen interest in this case at the time, and I think that this was a typical example of the lack of supervision or rules in the United Kingdom, and it is therefore unfair to hold Europe responsible now. Moreover, this was back in the Thatcher era, just to put it into context.</p>
<p class="contents">I will confine my observation to a number of issues that have also been covered in the report and that have recently been discussed, particularly in the debate about the way in which national interests can once again come into play in competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On that score, there are certainly two things that affect the rules of European competition policy, one of which is the two-thirds rule. It would be good if further steps could be taken in that respect, because too little consideration is being given to the differences in size of the Member States and the effect that certain measures have, also for the sake of neighbouring countries and for regional policy. That is a crucial point which we have once again raised. The second point has also already been touched upon by Mrs Berès when she quoted the example of stock markets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious in that case that, even though the turnover is below the threshold of European interference, the effect of such a level of concentration can very much be European, and as the Commissioner already indicated, that is therefore a reason to find out if we can broaden the criteria for European competences in this connection too. I should like to raise this issue once again in respect of those points, and I should also like to ask for support for our Amendment 9. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this House has also, taking the Commission’s report as its basis, been able to produce a good alternative text, the positive aspects of which have already been mentioned several times.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about two things that have not yet been mentioned. The first is that I believe it would be desirable for the Commission, in the coming year, that is to say when evaluating the year 2005, to again list services of general economic interest separately. After all, the Commission does want, in the immediate future, to enact further legislation in this area, and so consideration of it under a separate heading would be beneficial. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I was rather surprised that the report on the year 2004 made absolutely no reference to postal markets. We are, in fact, following with great interest the moves to open up the postal sector, and believe that these reports will, over the coming years, give us a few things to read about.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me, though, to pass over the report and make a few brief comments on competition policy in general. It is always being said that competition law is at the heart of the European treaties, but – as has already been lamented – it does lay considerable burdens on the executive. The cases that we are currently getting in Europe do, however, raise the issue of whether competition law really is still supreme or whether it might not be the case that other factors have started to play an important role. I believe that we in this House can say, with hand on heart, that we really do want to give priority in our economic policy to the full transposition of Articles 81 and 82. </p>
<p class="contents">While I think it is an extremely good thing that you are also introducing a number of structural reforms into European law on restrictive agreements, I do also believe that there are many issues – of which the ‘<span class="italic">stop-the-clock-shop</span>’ is one – that show us that what is needed is better cooperation between the national competition authorities. With that in mind, I encourage you to carry on from where your last speeches began. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have witnessed a series of mergers in the internal market that have led to natural monopolies in essential goods and services. The Commission’s evaluation of this phenomenon, although in principle a good idea, is often inconsistent with these objectives in practice, especially when it comes to public services. At a time when protectionist sentiments have resurfaced, Europe must guarantee its citizens that it is capable, above all, of ensuring the provision of essential goods and services safely, universally and at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not sufficient to deepen the internal market. This must at least be accompanied by better regulatory powers. Community regulation needs to be effective and the discrepancies between the Member States must not lead to further competition distortion. Europe’s citizens will only have confidence in the construction of the internal market if they receive guarantees that the monitoring of their most basic needs will be strengthened. It is therefore important to update the rules in force to meet our objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear, then, that the European Parliament advocates enhanced consultation, because we want as much competition as possible and – for social and environmental reasons and for the sake of fairness and ethical values – only as much regulation as is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that the drawing of every boundary is a political issue. It is the competition policy that drives the internal market, and that is why there is a connection between the implementation of the four freedoms using the competition policy or because of it, and the reinforcement – both external and internal – of the single market. I get the feeling that we are still treating competition policy as being on three levels: competition policy within the Member States, competition policy between the Member States, and the competition policy of the European Union in a globalised world, and that that is the reason why there is so much legal uncertainty. The Altmark ruling may well have laid down clear test criteria, but there have been plenty of instances in which the Commission has interpreted them in different ways. There is, on the one hand, the debate about whether investigation of dominant position should refer to the national market on one occasion and to the European market on another. There is no clear distinction drawn between what is part of competition policy and what is part of services of general interest. Now the chapter has been removed from the report altogether. As I see it, competition policy also involves ensuring that directives, once adopted by us, are implemented uniformly. Inconsistent transposition of directives results in distortion of competition and is one of the causes of the resurgent protectionism with which we have to contend vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the creation of a single European area for both research and energy, while also advocating codecision in fiscal policy matters, where the very minimum that is required is a single tax base for businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I welcome both the European Parliament report as changed and the Commission’s report on the guidelines for 2004. Things are moving in the right direction and I should like to congratulate the whole team of DG Competition and the Commissioner, who is continuing Mr Monti’s work very well. We are living in a mood of economic nationalism right now, and being the Competition Commissioner is not necessarily the easiest job in town. The Commissioner is doing a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point – and one that Mr Hökmark made as well – is that it is very important to take a broad approach. To my mind, competition and the internal market are married; they go hand in hand. Commissioner Kroes takes care of the competition part and Commissioner McCreevy takes care of the internal market side. If today we were to define the four freedoms, I do not think, unfortunately, in the mood we are in, that we would get them. Therefore, keep the four freedoms in mind; they are under attack, much like competition policy in general.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my final point about the four key areas dealt with in the report itself. The first is mergers: keep on fighting against the type of protectionist behaviour that you see, for example, from the Spanish Government in the Endesa case or from the Polish Government in the banking sector. Secondly, on state aid: continue your vigorous control, kill all the national champions you can – they are bad for consumers and taxpayers. I would urge you to read Mr Hökmark’s report on this issue. The third is Article 81 on cartels: fight them. They are all over the place; they try to hide; tease them out; keep the consumers happy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on Article 82 on dominant positions: there is a sufficiently high profile case. I am not entirely sure that all is clear on that case. One can perhaps see both sides, but it is important to keep at it and, much like Mr Evans said, if we want a transatlantic market, let us keep it and let us watch out for American protectionism in the meantime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to associate myself with the comments made by Mr Stubb and Mrs Bowles, but I would like to talk about transparency in these issues. Am I the only one here to think that the behaviour in the Commission in relation to transparency in competition cases has been quite odd? It is bizarre in a way, because the Commission seems to be conducting prosecutions in the media, rather than in hearings or in courts. Before Christmas we had the strange outbursts from the Commission spokesperson in relation to the case concerning the collective selling of UK football premiership TV rights, and this tactic has been repeated in the Commission’s ongoing anti-trust investigation into Microsoft.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly find it a matter of concern that the Commission, whilst acting as investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury in competition cases, can make public statements condemning the people it is investigating, or happily allow confidential documents to enter the public domain without any apparent concern or investigation. Those of us interested in transparency in the European Parliament, and indeed those of us interested in justice in the wider world, are becoming more worried that the Commission seems to be willing to ride roughshod over natural justice in its bid for a judicial and public relations result against those it is pursing.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Commissioner, you have made a number of very sensible statements about the future direction of competition policy in the EU, including the statement on 13 December 2005 on improving rules for access to files in merger and anti-trust procedures. Can I humbly suggest that you circulate this more widely throughout your department, because in the recent Microsoft case and in others before that – in the General Electric case, in the Tetra Laval case and in the TV premiership football case – access to information and files you are keeping has been one of the Commission’s weaknesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me say that I am very happy with the statements of nearly everybody in this debate, especially the remarks that have been made about this portfolio. Competition policy is a challenge; indeed it is an instrument, a motor for achieving the Lisbon Agenda. I could not agree more with Mr De Rossa and Mrs van den Burg that we must deliver, within the framework of Europe, sustainable and full employment and social welfare; but at the end of the day we must also deliver more economic growth and more and better quality jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to a couple of details about competition policy, it was rightly mentioned that cartels are absolutely unacceptable and we must combat them. Where there is a near-monopoly, we have to realise that this does not benefit the consumer. People may argue that in the short term it is a pleasing situation, but I can assure you that a monopoly or near-monopoly will not be very keen to spend money in areas like research or innovation. Yet we badly need that type of investment. Why? Because we have to compete on the global stage, because we need to be aware that competitors from outside Europe are investing in depth in research, in innovation, and in their competitiveness. So, Mr Evans rightly referred to the need for fair treatment, for a bilateral but not unbalanced approach: if we are behaving ourselves, the others should behave as well. It is a question of the competitiveness of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I really appreciate your interest in competition policy. The Commission informs you of all the major policy initiatives in this area and, of course, I pay attention to all the opinions of Parliament. We may not agree completely at every moment, on every subject, every dossier; I do not agree with a couple of remarks that were made this evening because the way they were put does not reflect the truth and is not realistic. But I will come back to that in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened carefully to the views expressed by the rapporteur, by the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by all other Members. I would like to add a few words in response to specific issues. On international cooperation, I think that in a global market competition is very important and the competition authorities need to be in line. Regarding a European network, I am really impressed by the European competition network and those concerned are doing an extremely good job. We can still learn from each other and we still need to realise that the time has passed for national policy. At the end of the day we have one internal market. It is about two-way traffic. Mr McCreevy and I are buddies and we need to tackle all the barriers that have to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Microsoft, which was touched upon by a couple of Members, the Commission is actively pursuing the implementation of the March 2004 decision. I accept, of course, remarks that do not agree with my line, but to say that we are not transparent, that we are not listening to all the questions and remarks, is not the truth. Since March 2004, there has been a decision, which has rightly been mentioned and discussed; I have done so myself with the head of Microsoft. With regard to Professor Neil Barrett, a very highly respected advisor to the Commission, he was indeed appointed by the Commission, but the list he headed came from Microsoft. He is very well-known for his knowledge and independence and to put it in quite clear language, he is the bridge between Microsoft and the Commission. He is indeed the advisor. But when we took the decision in December 2005, the statement of objections – which included a preliminary finding that Microsoft had not delivered what it had promised, that its obligation under the March 2004 decision did not take the form we were expecting – was not made public because of issues relating to certain procedures, protectionism and the legitimate interest of all parties. The hearing was an opportunity to have what I hope was a fruitful debate and every participant in it was given the floor. This is not only about Microsoft; there are complainants elsewhere and there are a couple of other really interesting American companies.</p>
<p class="contents">So Microsoft is not the only interesting company from the United States: there are a couple of other interesting companies that have lodged complaints with me. Therefore, without a doubt, I had to act and to react. I hope that will clarify the situation when we come to discuss what was talked about last Thursday and Friday. Another hearing – the Court hearing – will take place in Luxembourg on 24-28 April 2006. Once we have discussed what was talked about last week, we will come to a conclusion as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Berès mentioned Mittal’s bid for Arcelor. She should read it and she promised me she would, so let me be precise: the announcement of Mittal’s bid for Arcelor has attracted a great deal of attention not only in the media but also in some European capitals. The operation has not yet been formally notified to the Commission. If and when it is, the Commission will examine it very carefully and impartially and will conduct a wide-ranging investigation to assess its possible impact on the steel industry in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the responsibility of the Commission, the Commissioner and the services involved always to look very carefully and impartially at all cases. Size and nationality in itself is not a factor in making our decisions. The question is whether a decision can be taken and whether things can be done in the way requested by the parties, or whether there should be remedies. We will be looking at that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the merger regulation and competence for cases under the two-thirds rule, which a couple of Members mentioned. At the moment we are asking the Member States for information. Once we have received that information we will have a debate and dialogue with those Member States and will try to reach conclusions. The rules and decisions were made in the 1980s and were right for that time, but since then, fortunately, the internal market has developed. I am aware that the internal market is not yet complete, we still have quite a lot of work to do and the four main freedoms still need to be achieved. At that time the two-thirds rule was the correct instrument, but now we have to consider whether it is still appropriate in that area. In certain sectors we need to ensure a balance and equal treatment, and there should be transparency regardless of the country in which a merger takes place. Brussels must ensure equal treatment, whatever the background to a merger might be.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hökmark and Mrs Ferreira raised the subject of mergers in the internal market. We are all aware that concerns have been expressed about the alleged upsurge of protectionism. It should be combated. I can understand it just a little, but it is not allowed and should not be tolerated. We should explain to those concerned that it is not in line with the decision we took on one internal market, one Europe, in which we are and will be in a better position to compete with the outside world. The Commission has significant powers under the Treaty to act as an independent and impartial referee to ensure that Member States fully respect the internal market rules and do not create unlawful obstacles to cross-border mergers. I can assure you that the Commission is firmly committed both to using these powers and to corporate restructuring in Europe. For that we need a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It was rightly said that we must apply the rules of the game in the same way whether the team is playing at home or abroad. We have rules to respect and we have decisions to respect – the decisions taken in the past. We have to implement those decisions: one internal market and the Lisbon Agenda. Nearly all of you agreed that we should fight for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
