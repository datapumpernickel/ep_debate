The social situation, as we know, is deteriorating, and worrying signs are already coming to light, notably the fact that 20 million people are unemployed and around 70 million people are subsisting below the poverty line, and these problems particularly affect women, the elderly and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment, which averages around 9% - although that figure rises to 10% among women and more than 18% among young people – is particularly rife in Poland, where the unemployment rate is pushing 19%, with Slovakia, Lithuania and Spain not far behind. In other countries, however, such as Portugal, there are regions in which the unemployment rate is very high due to growing de-industrialisation, to the relocation of multinationals and to the privatisation of public sectors and services. At the same time, existing employment is increasingly insecure and women are the main victims of that insecurity. On average in the EU, only one in three permanent full-time jobs is held by a woman, and it is women who continue to suffer from direct and indirect wage discrimination, with wage differences ranging from 16% to 30% on average, and even higher in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from these figures that the strategies for creating more quality jobs accompanied by workers’ rights are falling short of what is required, because, in the name of competitiveness, emphasis has been placed on the neoliberal doctrine, on the European Central Bank, on the irrational implementation of the criteria for nominal convergence of the Stability and Growth Pact, on accelerating liberalisations and privatisations and on the flexibility and deregulation of work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that we scrap the Stability Pact and replace it with a genuine development and employment pact that gives priority to creating more quality jobs accompanied by workers’ rights, a pact that commits us to a root and branch revision of the Lisbon Strategy, thereby eliminating the liberalisation and deregulation of work and placing all of the emphasis on jobs with rights and social inclusion. In order to achieve the 70% employment target set in Lisbon, 22 million more jobs will have to be created. Otherwise, instead of progressing towards economic, social and territorial cohesion, inequality will deepen, be it inequality between countries or inequality between different sections of the population. At the moment, indeed, the average per capita income in various Member States is below 51% of the Community average, whereas in 10 countries the figure is over 100% of the EU average.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, 20% of the population with the highest income was almost five times better off than the 20% with the lowest income, although this indicator varied from 3% in Denmark to 6.5% in Portugal and the situation has worsened in recent years. Such inequality must not be allowed to continue, when 15% of the EU population is at risk of poverty, a figure that in some countries rises to 20% or more, as in Portugal, Greece and Ireland. Welfare and social security benefits are vital to reduce the risk of poverty. Without social transfers, including pensions and other forms of support, the risk of poverty would affect, on average, 30% of the population in Finland, 37% in Portugal, 40% in France and the United Kingdom and 42% in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">With the rise in unemployment in recent years and benefit cuts in some Member States, poverty and social exclusion are now in reality probably even more widespread than these statistics suggest. This points to the need to place emphasis on social inclusion within the Community’s various policies, especially monetary policy and internal market policy, with a view to defending the concept of high-quality public services. The Commission must therefore withdraw its proposal for a directive on the completion of the internal market in services and must not push through new regulations on the organisation of working time. Measures must be put in place aimed at restricting company mergers and multinational relocations, at supporting productive sectors and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, at combating existing discrimination, at promoting equality and participatory democracy and at reducing working hours without loss of earnings, in order to facilitate the creation of more jobs, to reconcile work with family life and to provide lifelong training and education. The new social policy agenda must not be a mere collection of words and statements without practical content.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that there will be a debate in this House on these issues. I should like to thank those people who helped me to draw up this report, which will hopefully be adopted without the amendments contained in certain proposals tabled by members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by the liberals. This is because what we need is more jobs and greater social inclusion, so that, when the EU speaks about economic and social cohesion, it will not simply be uttering words but will actually be taking steps towards greater well-being for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the debates with Members of the European Parliament in the preparation of the new social agenda, which was adopted by the Commission on 9 February, I emphasised the significance of your bill. I am using my participation in today’s session to remind us that the preparation of this standpoint, including the debate held by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with representatives of social partners and civil society, has helped create a new social agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s position offers a cohesive overview of the set of problems in this field, of which there are many. Unemployment, uncertainty, poverty, inequality, discrimination. These are genuine, specific problems which cause grave suffering to our citizens. They have the legitimate expectation that the European Union will tackle these problems and help to find appropriate solutions. In addition to this, there are issues such as the impacts of globalisation, economic restructuring, demographic upheaval, and greater diversity in the European Union as a result of the latest wave of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament asks that the Commission draw up and publish studies and indicators focusing on all these main tasks and their mutual effects. I would like to point out that the Commission regularly publishes analyses and statistics in its political documents, and especially in regular reports, covering issues such as the social situation in Europe, employment in Europe, and industrial relations in Europe. These are documents which always arouse keen interest among journalists and entities involved in social issues. I can confirm that I fully intend to continue this approach. These reports provide a very good cohesive overview of social problems, offer a summary of statistics, and present detailed analyses concentrating on specific themes such as the protection of health, the quality of work, restructuring, discrimination and equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has an extremely negative opinion of the report we are debating today. We believe that from the outset this report relied too heavily on an ideological approach to social problems in the European Union. At the same time, it ignores a number of key practical aspects relating to the real social situation in the European Union and the real problems we face.</p>
<p class="contents">It would perhaps be best if I focus just on two issues to which I should like to draw the attention of the House. Firstly, I come from a post-Communist country that for over 50 years enjoyed ‘blessings’ such as a planned economy, the abolition of private property rights and restrictions on competition. I can therefore state quite categorically that the rapporteur has failed to make any allowance in her assessments for the significant influence of Communist regimes on the social situation in the new Member States. Our past experiences lead us to believe that the European Union should not place excessive restrictions on the freedom to pursue economic activities. The critical assessments in the report are used as a basis to put forward proposals to increase the administrative burden on entrepreneurs, as well as to widen the tax base and create new employment pacts, yet new pacts and new legislative solutions are not what we need. Any debate we hold on unemployment should also focus on employers, as the only effective way to create new jobs is to make it possible for them to pursue their activities. This would then solve the problem of unemployment in an extremely practical manner. We will not create new jobs by imposing additional administrative burdens on entrepreneurs, raising taxes and placing restrictions on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has therefore tabled a great many amendments. We would stress that in order for the group to vote in favour of the report, the very least that would be necessary would be for all the amendments to be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The social situation in the European Union in 2004, which we are looking at today and which is the subject of the report we have before us, is alarming. Mass unemployment, social inequalities, instability and insecurity have grown over the last 20 years. Although social development and the fight against poverty are the common objectives of the Member States, we are obliged to note that the laws of the market are today working against the interests of individuals and that more than 70 million European citizens are today at great risk of poverty and insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we have to answer is a simple one: are we going to promote social equality and development equality, or are we going to allow free competition to make the social situation in Europe even worse? We must answer that question by adopting a social agenda that takes concrete measures to deal with the problem. I do not have the time to go into details, but I would like to suggest at least two priorities: we must move towards an upward harmonisation of social situations and not use directives to introduce social dumping; we need a sharing of wealth that allows solidarity, not competition between poor regions and rich ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a great deal that we can support in the resolution, especially concerning lifelong learning, SMEs, corporate social responsibility, disadvantaged regions and the fight against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have some serious concerns, more specifically with regard to paragraph 1, paragraph 5, indent 5, and recital E. Meeting these concerns is crucial to our decision on the final vote. We have two difficulties with paragraph 1. Firstly, we appreciate the need for adjustments to be made to financial and economic policies over time, but the use of ‘revision’ implies a fundamental departure from them, as Mrs Figueiredo effectively acknowledges in her speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the paragraph is too diffuse. We prefer the emphasis that our own amendment places on how the Lisbon Strategy should address deficiencies in the current social situation. In the other two cases, our concern is not with the whole content of the indent or recital involved, but with infelicitous phrases found there. Those are covered by appropriate amendments or requests for split votes. This is true for various other improvements that we would prefer to see made to the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on recital M, there have been some translation problems. We would specify that this must be understood as asking only for Member States to consider introducing the concept of a minimum income as the basis of social protection when they do not currently have such a system. It is not an attempt to move toward some kind of Europe-wide minimum wage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After listening to the constant talk about competition, economic growth, the free movement of capital, services and goods and so on, it does one good to see Europe, of whose being the ‘Christian West’ we hear so much, setting limits to neo-capitalism and focusing attention on our fellow-creatures, our environment and those who will come after us. We cannot be indifferent to the fact that, in a Europe that is generally rich, one person in seven faces the threat of poverty. We cannot keep on increasing working times – expressed in weeks or over a lifetime – when we know that some 20 million people, most of them women, are out of work in the EU. There should be more solidarity expressed in the way we share out work and wages.</p>
<p class="contents">We surely cannot look away when conglomerates, often having received subsidies for their businesses, simply move them to where they can make the greatest profits and where they find the most propitious conditions in terms of wages, taxes, social security contributions, mandatory environmental requirements, controls and so on. Businesses also bear social responsibilities. Social peace is dependent upon justice. Solidarity is the best network for combating poverty and counteracting social exclusion. Social security contributions are often akin to a handout, a humiliation for the recipients, particularly when they are in need through no fault of their own. I hope that a broad majority in the House will support this report and that the Council and the Commission will take up as many as possible of the issues it raises, for we cannot sit idly by while the few rich people in Europe get even richer and the number of poor people rises. What is needed is a push in a different direction, and the one this report will give will be a big one, and in the right direction.</p>

In the European Union at present, 68 million people are living in poverty and excluded from society, a state into which the unemployed, lone parents, and migrants are at particularly high risk of falling. It is therefore not surprising that children from such households are at particularly high risk of falling into poverty as well. In Germany alone, which is considered a rich country by EU standards, the number of children living in poverty is said by Unicef to have risen to 1.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three key factors that determine the proportion of poor children in rich countries: social policy, social trends and the way in which the labour market develops. So it is that falling wages for the bottom 10% of the income scale has reduced family incomes in Germany by 23%. Let me then, again call for this report to be adopted, and for the Council meeting in March to devote all its energies to the social situation in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a certain difference in outlook between Mrs Figueiredo's report and the Barroso Commission. The report, if adopted, would lead to further initiatives and pressure to press on with the Lisbon agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission seems to be heading the other way, towards a freer structure. Recently it proposed that 80% of resources be managed in a decentralised way. If competencies were indeed to be restored to the nation state, the UK Independence Party might be persuaded to support the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is because the UK was drawn into what was then the EC on the promise that it was not leading to a federal state, but that it was simply about trade. If only that were so. One thing is certain: the UK has half the average unemployment rate of the EU as a whole. Along with Sweden and Denmark we have the lowest levels of unemployment. Governments do not produce that. They simply make the conditions right for employment to flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">The single most important factor is the common currency. Sweden, Denmark and the UK have not adopted the single currency, so they are not saddled with a single interest rate. Even in the UK there is a disparity of economies. The Bank of England cannot set an interest rate suitable for the whole country. How then can the European Central Bank set a common interest rate suitable for a Europe with widely varying economies arising from such great geographical diversity and widely differing ways of life?</p>

<p class="contents">When we speak about a social Europe, the most important aspect of that is our responsibility to those who are most vulnerable within our society. In particular we must protect those suffering from handicap, from disability, from a lack of advantage. The European Union has proven in the past that it can be a force for good by creating equality and providing greater social protection and standing for those most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not, nor should it be, a one-size-fits-all policy. There is no one single method that has been proven to work in any one area. It is a combination of what is best from each of the ideologies, each of the methods, to achieve the greatest success. So I would caution people against restricting the amount of investment that private industry and business put into creating new jobs, new employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also call on Members to ensure that they do not unnecessarily harness negative taxation policies that restrict the room for movement of governments and, most importantly of all, to ensure that we invest in the future of our people through education and life-long learning.</p>

I therefore feel it is an unbalanced report. The text focuses on all of the negative aspects, which we acknowledge still exist, such as social exclusion, unemployment and the existence of pockets of poverty, yet chooses to ignore all of the aspects highlighted by the Commission. In those areas in which the Commission highlights positive aspects, progress has been made in the social situation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now cite five omissions that I consider very serious; firstly, the report leaves out the fact that during the past decade progress has been made on employment, output growth and cohesion in most of the 25 Member States; secondly, it deliberately ignores the fact that, according to the Commission, the social problems in eight of the ten new Member States are mainly due to the totalitarian regimes that were previously in power; thirdly, there is not a single word on the opportunities available to the new Member States following accession to the EU; fourthly, the report disregards all of the complexity arising from the phenomenon of globalisation; and fifthly the report emphasises an outlook – an erroneous one in our view – that economic dynamism is the enemy of social development. We take the opposite view, namely that economic dynamism, price stability and cost reduction are not enemies but allies of the development of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the report before us offers a highly simplistic view of European social reality, with smatterings of a certain demagogy. Symptomatic of the ideological influence pervading the report, moreover, is the fact that nowhere does it mention the proven superiority of the social market economy over planned economic models. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A European Union of 25 Member States obviously shows greater economic and social disparities than when there were only 15. That is why it is even more important now than it was then to promote real social cohesion on our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">To defend a European social model that would bear witness to a Europe of excellence is not to defend the <span class="italic">status quo</span>.

<p class="contents">What would greater competitiveness mean without a just social policy? What would greater growth mean if it did not benefit the largest number? The answer is obvious: everyone knows that policies that encourage social cohesion are determining factors in economic dynamism. On the forthcoming 22 and 23 March, the Heads of Government will be taking a crucial decision for the future of Europe when they adopt a strategy that will set the economic development agenda for five years.</p>

It should also be adapted to the needs of today and the anticipated needs of tomorrow. Thirdly, the report notes, and rightly so, that too little attention has been paid to social aspects in the Lisbon strategy.

However, the problem with it, of course, is that it completely skates over what are the real problems in the European economy, and I am puzzled that no questions at all are asked as to why things are really going so badly. Why does the United States have, on average, a 40.5% higher gross national product per inhabitant than we have in even the richest part of the EU - 15?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer is very clear. The European economy is moving too slowly because we engage too little in research and development. We do not work for very many years of our lives. Only 63% of all people of working age are in the labour market. We do not work for very many hours per week and do so using antiquated technology. It is no good sharing out poverty, as this report proposes we do. The thing is, to increase growth so that there is enough for distribution to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Try looking at the figures for my own country, Denmark, and you will see that it has succeeded both in implementing a socially aware policy and in creating growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recital L, after referring to the worrying situation of unemployment within the Union, the claim is made that immigration is needed in order to tackle the direct implications for the current labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I fundamentally disagree. What we need, in my view, is more stability and fewer stop-gap measures, more certainty and continuity of employment and less public support for major companies, particularly multinationals, which benefit from incentives and tax breaks from the European Union and its Member States, often repaying this by relocating and committing fraud which adversely affects savers.</p>
<p class="contents">In point five following Recital M, a reference is very properly made to participatory democracy. In this context, we should be continuing to pursue the goal of direct participation in the life of companies, as already stated in the never-applied article 46 of the Italian Constitution – borrowed, moreover, from the Labour Charter of the Italian Social Republic – which recognises the right of workers to collaborate in the management of companies, in the manner and within the limits established by law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an example of a legal expedient which, had it been incorporated in the European Constitution and thereafter implemented, would have enhanced the acceptability of a document which is instead an intrusive instrument for the coercion of the destiny of the European population – or which, at the very least, would have enhanced its social value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing a report on the social situation in the European Union; this report states that the social situation is not good. However, the report fails to name the actual causes of failure. The true reasons for the slump in economic growth and employment are the restrictions in the freedom to engage in business, the rising cost of labour, mushrooming regulation, bureaucracy, increasing redistribution and the influence of the state. The cause of the problem is that personal initiative, responsibility, and effort are kept separate from social and economic appraisal. Redistribution breaks the bond between success and affluence. The more we redistribute in favour of those who, through their own fault, are unsuccessful, the more unsuccessful people we will have. If we continue to confuse equal opportunities with egalitarianism and mediocrity, the more mediocre people we will have.</p>
<p class="contents">The correct and only genuine way to improve the social situation is through economic growth. Only a wealthy society can afford to spend more on social programmes. We need to cut taxes, clamp down on regulation, and defend the freedom to engage in business. The rights of employees must be balanced with the rights of employers; education must be connected with success. The rights of diverse groups of citizens must not be allowed to overshadow universal rights, the rights of us all; support for one group must not result in restrictions for another.</p>
<p class="contents">I have found none of these solutions or proposals in the report; in fact, the opposite is true. The report, as drafted, does not benefit the European Parliament, the European Union, its Member States, or their citizens. And therefore I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against the proposed report. Thank you. </p>

In most of these countries, the main pillar continues to be a single pay-as-you-go scheme. I believe that this system, once the necessary modifications have been made, the retirement age has been extended, and contributions have been raised, is the only system capable of guaranteeing a decent pension for future pensioners. At the same time, this would make it possible to respect the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization that most of the new countries have ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">The conservative parties in most of these countries are mooting a reduction in the pensions guaranteed by the state to a level under the limit guaranteed by the conventions, and the setting-up of another pillar based on mandatory insurance. In my opinion, this solution is risky and offers no guarantee of a sufficient income in old age, because the legislation required to make this pillar work is very patchy. What is more, the administrative costs of private institutions are several times higher than the costs reported by state-controlled institutions. If employees are to pay mandatory contributions to private insurance in addition to contributions to a state pension, then I think a better solution would be to increase the contribution to guarantee the first pillar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you look, though, at the unemployment figures not only in Germany, but also in my own country of Austria, it would appear that these efforts have already proved fruitless, for the point has to be made that, at the same time as jobs have migrated from them to low-wage countries, illegal immigration has created a new underclass at home. When, for example, as we see from the German visa scandal, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Ukrainians enter the EU in the guise of tourists in order to provide cheap labour, this means in real terms that jobs in the EU Member States are being wiped out.</p>
<p class="contents">The war on unemployment must therefore also be a war on illegal immigrants and on illegal migrant labour. It is self-evident that dubious organisations or firms must be prevented from bringing cheap labour into the EU under cover of the freedom to provide services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Though it is true that the text has been improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is also the case that it retains a tone which is clearly in favour of interventionism, and all the factors that mean economic and social development in the European Union, such as private initiative, the market or competition policy, are forgotten and relegated to second place. In short, this report defends policies and formulas that have traditionally been advocated by the European left. Our first amendment, therefore, is intended to highlight the important role of private initiative in the Union’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to paragraph 1, as other rapporteurs have mentioned, I believe that its wording is particularly inappropriate. A reading of it would suggest that the European Union’s unemployment problems are due to the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy, the internal market or competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely these factors, I believe, that need to be strengthened if we want to ensure that the Union grows, creates employment and enjoys greater social cohesion. And this is the case, for example, in my country, Spain, as has been demonstrated, where over recent years, an economic policy based on the balance of public accounts, tax reductions and the implementation of liberalising reforms in key sectors has led to the creation of five million jobs. As the High-Level Group chaired by Wim Kok has recognised, the problem stems from the lack of commitment on the part of some Member States to the reforms necessary for implementing strategies, rather than the strategy itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our only intention with the rest of the amendments is for this Parliament to reflect the concern at the problems faced by young people in terms of accessing the labour market, as well as the need to remove the fiscal and administrative barriers faced by European entrepreneurs.</p>

The constantly decreasing number of people in work has resulted in drastic cutbacks in social security systems. Any pro-active policy for the social market economy must have a particular concern for society’s outsiders, for young people without adequate education, for people who are poorly integrated into society. Mr Silva Peneda is absolutely right; this draft report is permeated by an ideological bias. Even over 100 amendments have done little to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have in any case got shot of the demand for mergers and relocations to be made conditional upon the retention of jobs. Such an idea would occur only to a central authority with the right to give or withhold permission, and is fatally reminiscent of the state control that characterised the socialism that is now defunct. What we favour is the involvement of the social partners and European social dialogue. I would like to see the report ‘The state of corporate social responsibility’ made compulsory reading for managers.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Commissioner Špidla is on the receiving end of Mrs Figueiredo continuing assertions to the effect that the Lisbon strategy gives too little weight to the social dimension. Welfare is every bit as significant as stable prices, reduced costs and smaller budget deficits. What we need is growth that achieves a balance between economic considerations and the need for job creation, thus making successful social integration possible. She is still calling for the financial perspective and the Structural Funds to be topped up. Where, though, is the money supposed to come from? My proposal for burdens to be shared out fairly between the Member States, thus guaranteeing planning and funding, was of course rejected. Far from being a mish-mash of every kind of desirable thing, a new social policy agenda should concentrate on practically achievable actions, primarily investments in education, training and lifelong learning, with a marked rise in employment and a consequent reduction in unemployment, which is the basic cause of social exclusion.</p>

However, I agree with Mr Kułakowski that it is an important report, for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason is the subject matter itself: the fact that growth across the EU has halved in the past three years, and that unemployment now affects 20 million people, constitutes not just an economic disaster but also a gigantic social disaster. As so often when unemployment rises, the hardest hit are the vulnerable: young people trying to enter the employment market for the first time; young mothers trying to re-enter it; older people trying to stay in it. Those are some of the groups who suffer most, as was so eloquently pointed out by my colleague Mr Crowley and emphasised by his constituents in the visitors’ gallery. This subject calls for debate, but above all it calls for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason this issue is so important is the difference in views over the action required. Some political parties want to drive real change, whereas others are determined to block it. The rapporteur believes that we need more, rather than less, of the failed policies of the past: that more public sector jobs are one answer; that harmonised labour regulations are another; that more targets are another; that more legislation can produce more jobs; that the Services Directive should be dropped when it should be embraced; that the European social model should be preserved when it should be reformed. The former would be a recipe for more unemployment and greater social injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">The question now is whether, as in committee, the Socialists and Communists will vote as one to keep the old, failed agenda intact. On our side, we believe that it should not be voted through without fundamental amendment. We will vote to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, which means voting against the report as it stands.</p>

<p class="contents">Just how far away we are from these objectives is illustrated by the information set out in the Commission report: twenty million European citizens are unemployed and seventy million are on the verge of poverty. Violence against women and inequality between men and women have not disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, we are celebrating Women's Day today. What are we actually doing to wipe out violence against women and the family, when the results of research under the Daphne I programme have yet to be applied? When there are such social deficits, we cannot in fact talk about social protection and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Lisbon strategy has proven so far to be inadequate in drastically tackling the deficits in the social sector in the Union. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union places man at the heart of its action. The Council and the Commission talk about progress and increasing averages in the various social sectors. However, the minimum levels of civil and social rights of each citizen defined in the charter are evaluated not by averages, but by personal criteria. Sustainable development and social justice make sense not only when the general indicator of the economy and of human prosperity increases, but when social cohesion also progresses. Consequently, the main objective of the Union should not only be how to improve the life of the majority of citizens, it should basically be how to make the bad life of any minority into a good life at least.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for radical decisions and effective action. The responsibility lies with the Commission and each Member State of the European Union. The roadmap of the Lisbon strategy should be adjusted to the new circumstances. The objective is a dignified life for every European citizen, for every European citizen without exception. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
