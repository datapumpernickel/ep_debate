Considering its size and complexity, India’s stable and vibrant society remains a monumental achievement. Its commitment to democracy, pluralism and the rule of law guarantees consistency in trade relations. Yet, for a country approaching a fifth of the world’s population, India counts for less than one fiftieth of world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As India’s largest trading partner and principal source of foreign investment, the EU is poised to help India reap the benefits of liberalisation. With our shared history and commitment to secular government and religious pluralism, the EU and India are natural partners. We became strategic partners in June 2004, yet it was another year before a joint action plan was agreed. Even today, the Commissioner lacks the authorisation to turn the work of the high-level trade groups into a concrete deal. In the meantime, President Bush has succeeded in brokering a quite frankly worrying US-India nuclear deal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner claims India as his destination of choice – and of course I mean Commissioner Mandelson here – yet has fuelled EU obsession with China. India poses equal, if distinct, challenges for the EU and the Commission must reflect that as it lays out its new strategy by working with stakeholders to mirror its China consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Doha round remains the chief mechanism for shaping equitable globalisation. The multilateral trading system is a most just and effective way of expanding and managing trade and it shields the weak from the use and abuse in the unilateral scramble for trade domination. However, a Doha deal does not preclude bilateral WTO-plus arrangements. Only through greater openness to partnerships that go beyond what a lowest common denominator WTO deal could now provide, will the EU begin to address the global competitiveness agenda of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">A free trade agreement with India must be central to the Commission’s new global Europe strategy. This House must back the Commissioner 100% as he makes the case to the Council for a negotiating mandate to deliver bilateral FTAs, opening markets and securing fairer trading conditions in new areas of growth throughout Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">India must match our resolve and bolster its promises for Helsinki. India has proved itself adept at juggling global players to boost competitiveness. It is time for a deal with its most obvious partner. Deadlines must be set so that we can achieve common ambitions in the areas that will dictate the terms of the 21st century: protection of intellectual property rights, open markets for services and investment, and effective trade defence instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">No strategy for economic growth is complete without addressing the growing crisis of climate change. The impact of growth in Asia on energy supply is phenomenal. India’s future growth is dependent on meeting spiralling energy needs. Severe shortages and over-dependency on petrol and coal are driving up costs and pollution. An effort to develop nuclear energy is symptomatic of that crisis. However, even if India did develop nuclear energy it would meet only 2% of total energy requirements. It would also constitute a climb-down from Gleneagles pledges to halt climate change and promote energy conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Both India and the EU have long traditions of promoting renewable energy. India has built the world’s fourth largest wind power industry, developed biogas digesters and solar cells and supported the development of renewable energy in Asia. We must work together to define the global energy architecture through innovation and sustainable energy development whilst meeting climate change benchmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">India’s economic growth is booming at 8% and is set to double in a decade. Dotcom benefactors make up India’s rich list, cashing in as India becomes the global hub for ITC development. Yet India’s economy remains full of paradoxes. The uneven distribution of the benefits of globalisation has left nearly four million people living on less than one dollar per day.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must ensure that the benefits of our trading relationship are shared with Indians – all of them. International trade can be a powerful driver of economic growth and poverty reduction but it is not a silver bullet. To continue to lift people out of pockets of poverty, India’s trade reforms must complement development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Linking external and internal policies is not aided by India’s infrastructure, which displays characteristics of a developing nation while seats of enterprise dominate the skylines of Mumbai and Bangalore. Investment must focus on rural areas, providing better water supplies and sanitation, improving transport links and the quality of grid power output.</p>
<p class="contents">India is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and its own five-year plan exceeds UN expectations, but there is increased doubt that India will meet four out of the eight goals on schedule. Serious concerns remain over child labour and the spread of HIV/AIDS has a potential to disrupt India’s progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade relations cannot be divorced from human rights and development concerns. We have a duty to India to reverse those trends. EU assistance must be directed to lagging regions and under-represented social groups. Capacity-building efforts must focus on the poorest states, enabling them to use funds effectively. Foreign investment must provide funds for education and rural health.</p>
<p class="contents">As India moves from developing to developed, it bears regional responsibility and sustained growth. It must take its neighbours with it. SAFTA will bring manifold expansion in the region. True, it has not been smooth sailing and Indo-Pak disputes have stalled progress, but strong leadership in the region has led to trade now being used as a confidence-building measure, particularly over Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must look at Asia and consider its astonishing growth as an opportunity rather than a threat. The EU needs more confidence about its ability to manage change and remain competitive. Inevitably it will require some restructuring and a change of mindset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is comprehensive, addressing almost all possible aspects of EU-India economic and trade relations. This report is also timely, as it takes place ahead of the forthcoming EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October 2006, and we will take its recommendations into consideration. Our cooperation with India is manifold and it is difficult to address it exhaustively in this speech. Therefore, I will point to some of the main features that respond to your concerns and also update the House in more detail on the trade and investment issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally, our cooperation is good and is making progress. Regarding the environment, for instance, last year India hosted the first EU-India forum on waste management, which was followed by various visits by and meetings of the working party on that issue. The holding of the second Environment Forum is under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding employment and social issues, the Commission and the Indian Labour Minister agreed in a bilateral meeting a work programme for 2006 and 2007 based on the Joint Action Plan. A draft memorandum of understanding is to be signed, or initialled, at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit. More broadly, following a bilateral meeting between Commissioner Almunia and the Indian Finance Minister, the launch of regular macroeconomic dialogue has been proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The business side has not been forgotten and thanks to Commissioner Mandelson, who pushed forward the idea with his counterpart Trade Minister Nath, the EU-India CEO Round Table, allowing active business-to-business dialogue, is now ready to be launched at the Business Summit on 12 October 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Our development cooperation is concentrated on sector support for elementary education, health and family welfare. Poverty alleviation has been the central objective in all projects. The Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2007 to 2013 reaffirms that commitment with an approximately 65 to 70% allocation to the health and education sectors. Encouragingly, our State Partnership Programmes with Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, amounting to a total contribution of EUR 160 million towards supporting water management, education and health, have been signed and can now be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to trade and investment relations with India, I welcome the fact that the conclusions of the report adopted by the International Trade Committee fully support the Commission's approach. More specifically, the Committee has called on the European Union to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. India is keen to launch a free trade agreement with the European Union as soon as possible. This has been the Indian position for a long time, pushed by Prime Minister Singh himself.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the committee's first comment that negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) are not incompatible with bilateral WTO-plus negotiations. The European Union seeks to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral WTO trading system with a new generation of bilateral FTAs, in particular with key growing markets in Asia. The European Union continues to see the WTO as the fundamental platform on which to build global liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no retreat from multilateralism. An EU-India FTA can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement markets, competition policy and regulatory harmonisation, that are related directly to EU trading strengths not yet fully addressed by WTO rules or standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made sure that the economic case for an EU-India FTA is watertight and that there is a similar level of understanding and ambition on India's part, which is necessary for any negotiation to work. To that end, I welcome the committee's support for the High Level Trade Group's work. On 19 September 2006, the High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the EU-India Summit on 13 October 2006, which recommended that an expanded-trade partnership be developed through the negotiation of a broad-based trade and investment agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit will recommend that both EU and India move towards negotiations for such an agreement. Although we will not be launching an FTA at the summit, we will, however, be making positive signals that we are heading in that direction. We do not just want to launch but to prepare the ground for successful negotiations. This may mean further work on some of the more sensitive issues after the summit, so that we improve understanding of each other’s expectations and possibilities for movement. Accordingly, I share the committee’s views that there is a need to deepen discussion on services negotiations, intellectual property rights and public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also share the committee’s concern about the low level of intra-regional trade in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its recommendation to SAARC to review opportunities to expand trade and investment in the region. We are following closely the problem of Pakistan’s non-implementation of schedules under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement and addressing this informally with this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a complex report, as is only to be expected, since presenting an overview of economic and commercial cooperation between the European Union and India, whilst also highlighting the challenges facing the latter, is a complex task. I believe the rapporteur has dealt with it very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the significance of the economic and commercial issues contained in the report, but I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for supporting the opinion of the Committee on Development, and viewing India not just as a country undergoing dynamic economic development, a country with great potential and an important trading and economic partner for Europe, but also as a country with a particularly complex social structure, and a country of great inequalities in terms of development levels and in the distribution of profits gained.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, India is a country struggling with major problems that are typical for developing countries, such as poverty or illiteracy. As I emphasised in my report for the Committee on Development, the main thrust of the strategic partnership between the European Union and India must continue to be work aimed at attaining the Millennium Development Goals and the war on poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to two significant development policy issues which affect cooperation between the European Union and India. Economic growth in India has averaged 6% a year over the last ten years. Nonetheless, almost 30% of India’s population, some 400 million people, are still living below the poverty line, existing on less that a dollar a day. The level of illiteracy is almost 40%. It is vital that economic and trade cooperation between the European Union and India helps to redress this unfortunate imbalance. Our efforts must be directed at improving the lot of the poorest sections of society and at promoting best practices in the regions with the highest economic growth. Cooperation in the fields of health and education should also be deepened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That message relates to political, social, educational, scientific and developmental matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We overcame minor differences between political groupings to reach common positions which were often the result of compromise. India can assume from this resolution that the whole of Europe is united in its desire to cooperate with a country with such a great historical heritage and economic potential. Of course, for our part, we shall highlight the difficulties affecting the people of India. In line with European standards, however, these difficulties should be openly discussed and gradually resolved. In order to achieve successful cooperation involving entrepreneurs and citizens, shared common values and aims need to be established. If that is not the case, all that will emerge will be declarations signed by governments and politicians, and we have seen plenty of ineffective documents of that sort drawn up by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hoping for genuine cooperation that draws on the experience of past relationships, mainly between the United Kingdom and India. We trust, however, that it will develop into a cooperation partnership <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, free from the fetters of the past, which may be read as a reference to colonialism.</p>
<p class="contents">This document will serve as a basis and a springboard for a healthy exchange benefiting both partners. As shadow rapporteur, I move that it be adopted as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned one specific point to which I think we should give in-depth consideration, and that is that India might finally become a geopolitical centre in the 21st century. I think he is right about that and the European Union and the Commission will have to make up their minds. You cannot say ‘either India or China’; that is not the right approach. But we will certainly have to focus, because to deal with both countries and many more countries to come as regards bilateral agreements might be something that is impossible for the Commission whilst making sure that the multilateral round flourishes. So I would like to point out to the rapporteur and the House that my Group will be a little more cautious when it comes to a free-trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not against a free-trade agreement; quite the opposite. We already argued in favour of a free-trade agreement and regional agreement in 2002, when I presented my own report to this House, but I think we should first have an in-depth debate and discussion on the issue. The Commission will produce its new policy report on 4 October, in only a few weeks. So we will not support a free-trade agreement at the moment, because we want to have a debate in our Group first and we want to be clear that Parliament will be fully involved in the debate and the consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important and relevant to see a shift from the multilateral to the more bilateral agreement and to make sure that there is some coherence when it comes to trade policy. That is one of the reasons why tomorrow we are not going to support the idea of a free-trade agreement at this stage. I am happy also that Mr Karim touched on the various high-tech issues. I think it is absolutely essential that we focus more on India and cooperate more closely with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, everything I said is not on behalf of Glyn Ford, who is the shadow rapporteur. He apologises to Mr Karim for not being here. He has to go back to England, but he will certainly follow up the issues and discuss them in detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a factor which is crucial for Indian and European Union economic cooperation. The volume of investment is quite dependant on the confidence of investors in the target countries and applied standards of regulation of financial markets and accounting. Thus it would be a good idea to invite the Indian business community to take its cue from the accumulated expertise of the European Union in ensuring proper investor protection. I would like to ask the Commission to further promote the experience we have acquired and the European Union financial regulation model that we have been developing and applying so that the Indian business community can take advantage of our expertise in the field. To that end, the work of the Commission must be further coordinated so that Commissioners working in different fields can communicate on a larger scale and so that cooperation with third countries would not only be a task for those engaged in the field but also for all other Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major challenges is that the Indian financial sector is not sufficiently liberalised. It requires huge investments, especially for expanding business activities to rural areas. Without development of rural areas, Indian progress is simply unfeasible. But the development of the Indian financial sector will not be possible without input from the major world and European banks. Therefore, we should promote cooperation and invite the Indian regulators to take part in joint European Union and third country expert groups in drafting relevant legislation to ensure that appropriate conditions for common work are provided for in the early stages.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to support bilateral dialogue, full-fledged economic cooperation between the European Union and India, and reaching common agreements, particularly since multilateral negotiations do not always properly take relation-specific requirements into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the subject is trade with India. The report is excellent. I was able to concur with most of what it said, and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will, of course, vote in favour of the report. I wish, however, to concentrate here on one big issue: that of why human rights problems are not accorded importance in the report. They are discussed, but in very general terms. Moreover, the worst problem - and probably one of the world’s most extensive human rights problems – is almost not mentioned at all. I am thinking, of course, of the Dalits, who are casteless. They are mentioned, but in conjunction with the Adivasis, as if all that was at issue was a general problem involving minorities. The Dalits are a despised underclass in several countries, but they are, in particular, India’s problem. They are not only poor and socially excluded. The situation is worse than that. They are treated as if they were not human beings at all. They are untouchable, detested by the other population groups and at the bottom of the pile socially. They do have rights, but only on paper. In reality, they have no rights, and they do the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. That, moreover, is of course what is interesting in this case. It is they who, in industry and agriculture, work with chemicals so poisonous as to be banned in most of the world. Without instructions or protection, they spray the fields with deadly neurotoxins. In factories, they stand bare-footed in acid baths and colour our textiles. No one else would tolerate these things, but the Dalits are forced to do so. What is more, the EU deals in Indian products without asking candid questions about how they were made. It is a nasty business for India, but it is almost more awkward for Europe, which is well aware of what is happening. Often, we ourselves have sold them the dangerous products. Thousands of people are harmed and many die, and they are Dalits. The Dalits have no voice and no trade union. We ourselves are obliged to be their voice if the outrages are to be brought to an end. The problem needs to be on the EU’s agenda, and it is disgraceful that it is not clearly included in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">India is the world’s most populous democracy and, with a growth rate of 9% in 2005 alone, its rapid economic development as well as its geopolitical characteristics represent yet another challenge to the European Union on the world’s markets. In many respects it is a fascinating challenge and it may bring potential benefits for Europe, but there are also possible risks.</p>
<p class="contents">In India, 400 million people live on less than a dollar a day. Sixty-five per cent of the population work in the agricultural sector, with its antiquated structures and methods. Nuclear power is used just as a deterrent in the long-standing war with its neighbour Pakistan, but it is little used to promote ecologically sound development, and that makes the country dependent on energy from abroad and forces it to look around the world for the energy sources it needs for its development.</p>
<p class="contents">India is a country of great wealth and great poverty, and even today it is difficult for women to find work, apart from the most menial duties, and particularly skilled work, which means that it is difficult for women to be accepted as entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a simple matter to talk of India on account of its vast size and all the variables that that entails, but India also represents a major hope for improving the distribution of international trade. India is also a great country with an extremely fast-growing GDP and a highly competent class of people able to keep up with the new international challenges in the field of advanced technology. The economy is moving ahead in many regions, and the gates have been opened to foreign investment, although Europe seems so far to have been excluded. India only accounts for 1% of Europe’s total trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence we see a need to form a strategic partnership between these two great blocks, in order to create a more fertile climate for cooperation, with better mutual understanding to bring down the barriers between us by adhering to mutually agreed rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent disagreements in the Doha Round in Geneva led to a few difficulties, but India and the European Union should accept the responsibility of revitalising a multilateral framework. As a country at an advanced stage of development but with profound social imbalances, this Asian giant needs a stronger European presence that can help it achieve more balanced growth.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European side, there has to be a fair, open approach aimed at reinforcing Europe’s presence in India and duly supporting our initiatives in that part of the world. What is happening, as should also happen in connection with the growing economic expansion of China, is that Europe is seeking a strategy for itself in relation to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, ignore the scourge of child labour, in many cases involving very young children. This is extremely common in the Indian economy, which lacks minimum standards of social protection for the weakest sections of society; the caste system also makes it difficult for part of the population to live and to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, while we have the utmost respect for the traditions of this great country, we need to call on the Indian political and economic classes and the companies that operate in India to adopt a highly responsible position and to use every means to fight the problem of children who work rather than study, promoting instead the expansion of literacy, which is the real hope for people in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India will therefore become a strong counterbalance to China in trading terms. In the first quarter of this year, the rate of growth of the Indian economy increased to over 9%. As it moves on from being a developing country and comes to be recognised as a developed one, India is aspiring to catch up with China and take the lead in Asia. We should, therefore, attach particular importance to trade relations with India. The European Union is already India’s main trading partner. Trade with Member States of the European Union accounts for over 22% of exports from India.</p>
<p class="contents">India’s industry has risen to global challenges and welcomes science-based development as a business strategy. The large numbers of young, well-educated Indians who are cheap to employ and speak competent English represent a great asset to their country. They should become an advantage in terms of our bilateral relations. There are other factors, however, that the Union ought to draw to India’s attention. Over 390 million Indian citizens are living on less than a dollar a day and the statistics for child labour in India are amongst the highest in the world. This has to change.</p>
<p class="contents">The war on poverty must become a key feature of the strategic partnership between the European Union and India. We should also strive to ensure that India is better represented at the IMF. In addition, it would be appropriate to launch an initiative aimed at drawing up a free trade agreement with India. This would strengthen our strategic trading partnership for many years to come. Mr Karim has drawn up a good report that deserves our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a representative of the European Parliament and a member of the Committee on Development, I can only be delighted that India has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and that, through its actions, the Indian Government has shown for some time that it can be a reliable partner for possible future interaction and collaboration, not least in the commercial arena.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, however, that the efforts made so far in the fight against child labour, dumping – especially in the textile and footwear industries – and piracy, and to steer development along ecologically sound lines have been feeble and insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has a duty to support and encourage India so as to resolve such substantial problems by means of long-awaited and far-reaching structural reforms. Asia’s largest democracy has a responsibility to implement well-defined social reforms in order to overcome today’s caste-based society, which has considerable adverse effects both on access to education and services and on the more general condition of women’s lives. Fairness and equal opportunities should, therefore, be seen as targets to be achieved in the medium term through serious commitment and a tangible effort, while the economic field requires suitable financial reforms that will abolish non-tariff barriers and import duties and open up the market.</p>
<p class="contents">If the system were improved, it could and should lead to the development of long-term peaceful relations with its neighbouring countries, not least by increasing trade with Pakistan. It should also encourage trade on the internal market as well as synergies among the various regions, which are today characterised by enormous socio-economic disparities.</p>

<p class="contents">As we all know, India is the only large, dynamically developing economy in Asia where the European Union has a leading position in terms of foreign trade and outgoing foreign investments. Nonetheless, bilateral trade is uneven, as India is only the Union's tenth trading partner.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, it should be stressed that India is the biggest beneficiary under the Generalised System of Preferences, with preferential access to the Union's market.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the spectacular increase in bilateral cooperation, the volume of trade and investments is below the current potential. In my opinion, the results of exploratory contracts on a bilateral trade and investment agreement are a positive development. However, an actual agreement will depend upon strong political will on both sides. Under no circumstances, however, should such a bilateral agreement be interpreted in terms of a negation of our attachment to multilateralism. Within this framework, attention will need to be paid, among other things, to the high import duties and extensive technical barriers maintained by India.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues of common interest, such as more effective protection for intellectual property and geographical indications are especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one important parameter of the broader strategic partnership is further support for synergies in the sector of science and technology. In addition, as the Commissioner mentioned, the prospects for strengthening intraregional relations between the Union and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation need to be investigated and broadened.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to congratulate Mr Karim on his creative contribution to the work of the Committee on International Trade and the European Parliament in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As his report clearly demonstrates, when we are discussing India, the first problem is to decide which India we are discussing. Is it the India with nearly four million households earning over EUR 150 000 a year and with more graduates than any other country? Or is it the India with 390 million people living on less than a dollar a day, where two out of five of people are illiterate and where the so-called IT revolution only touches one in fifty Indians? I hope, as a Parliament, we are interested in both.</p>
<p class="contents">If India overcomes its infrastructure problems, most notably its persistent power cuts and poor transport networks, then I believe that within a generation it has the potential to be Europe’s largest trading partner, more important than China or the United States. I therefore welcome what Commissioner Borg said about the High Level Trade Group’s recommendations. I believe we should intensify our trade and investment relations with India. However, at this stage, I agree with Mrs Mann and Mr Papastamkos that we should stop short of a free-trade area, because we would not want India to be used as an example to denigrate the prospect of a successful DDA outcome. We must put our eggs in the DDA basket first and foremost, and anything else should be seen as a digression from that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Papastamkos rightly points out that 77% of Indian goods come into the EU market duty-free through the GSP. The GSP places an obligation on India to improve its core labour standards. India must do more to tackle child labour and bonded labour, and must sign up to ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and the right to collective bargaining. India signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and the EU, with our cooperation, should help by facilitating universal education, Eurohealth programmes and policies to get young people from poor areas into work.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that trade and development go hand in hand, but only if we work at it. It will not be automatic. We must have the political will to deliver on both. I welcome the report’s emphasis on both those aspects of our relations with India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India must do all it can in the G-20 in order to restore the Doha Development Agenda. The fact is that the multilateral trade system offers a country such as India enormous potential. That is why that country will need to make a reasonable offer in the form of a reduction of its import tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the issue of import tariffs must certainly be raised at bilateral level. Time after time, the Commission has underlined the importance of sound bilateral agreements, and that is what I am doing now. Both tariff and non-tariff-related obstacles constitute a considerable barrier to European enterprises.

Recently, the news has been good. India’s economic growth has been rapid, there has been commitment to a reduction in child labour, and India is one of the most proactive countries as far as action to combat dumping is concerned. India is also trying to reform its financial position, and is planning to remove restrictions on the rupee. Furthermore, the current human rights dialogue between the EU and India has got off to an encouraging start. India’s National Human Rights Commission has been working meticulously.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there have also been worrying developments. The gulf in living standards between the cities and the countryside is growing, and the environmental load is increasing. Nearly 400 million Indians, approximately a third of the country’s population, live on an income of less than a dollar a day. The massive growth in the economy is very unevenly spread: 40% of the population are illiterate. Ever-continuing discrimination based on the caste system in the country contributes to the unequal distribution of wealth and even the dwindling opportunities for economic growth. The worst off are the casteless Dalits, whose rights the authorities do not monitor closely enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the fact that the world’s largest democracy is actively aiming to correct these shortcomings that can be seen in its society through legislation. Positive discrimination is an example of this. Legislation is not enough, though: there also needs to be more effort put into implementation. Good policy decisions should be systematically put into practice by the local authorities. If the situation continues, much of the Indian people’s potential and many of their skills will remain untapped.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would make a serious request to the Council that it should put the following issues on the agenda of the EU-India Summit in Helsinki: the status of India’s disadvantaged, its environmental problems and how prepared it is to cope with natural disasters. Furthermore, the dialogue on energy which was begun in the spring should continue, because the main determining factor in India’s future economic growth is its ability to meet its demand for energy, one that is growing at a staggering rate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This great democracy is not only one of our privileged partners in Asia, but it is also an actor with ever greater responsibilities, both regionally and internationally. It is for that reason that I am grateful to my fellow Member, Mr Karim, for pointing out that our relations with India are not limited merely to the commercial field, but that they are bolstered by extensive cooperation in a vast number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">India has embarked on major reforms in relation to the promotion of the Millennium Development Goals, even though that may at times appear insufficient. It has committed itself to protecting the environment, to applying the international standards on labour law and to combating poverty and AIDS. Initiatives such as those must be encouraged and supported by a strong political will and by financial resources that are sufficient to meet the needs of this continent country.</p>
<p class="contents">Enhanced university cooperation between India and the European Union is indeed crucial, but we must ensure at all costs that we counter any possible brain drain, as that would deprive this country of its greatest asset. Let us not forget that our relations must be guided by the notion of partnership and of mutual exchange. We therefore cannot regard India merely as a huge pool of cheap labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The optimistic view that we have of our future cooperation with India must not conceal an ever difficult reality. As this report highlights, certain sectors of the Indian economy are very fragile. I am thinking, in particular, of the farming sector, which is suffering from the effects of the uncontrolled liberalisation of trade. That is why I am surprised – and I agree in this respect with what various Members have said – that the conclusion of a free trade agreement should have been proposed. Not only would a decision such as that be premature, but I must point out that the European Union has committed itself to acting first and foremost within the context of the Doha Round. To talk from now on about supporting bilateral negotiations would run counter to the principles that we have been upholding for months and would be a very bad sign for the multilateral structure that we earnestly desire.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude. If our aim is indeed to have trade work in favour of development, then our trade relations will have to be conceived in a concerted and gradual manner within a rational and solid framework with our partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the strengthening of political and economic dialogue and engagement as well as discussions on human rights at the India-EU Summit on 13 October. However, given the astonishing recent growth of India’s economy and its emerging global big-power status, our partnership must now deepen. Therefore I strongly favour a bilateral India-EU free trade agreement. That would have mutually beneficial results as our economies are complementary, as India needs our high-tech finished products and we need their services and basic machinery. We are already India’s biggest trading partner, at some EUR 40 billion annually, and we collaborate now on high-tech projects such as Galileo and ITER, demonstrating the sophistication of India’s 8% annual growth economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also call for enhanced regional cooperation and economic integration of India and Pakistan with SAARC and SAFTA, which enhances the confidence-building measures between the two states which, until recently, were on the verge of war. The line of control between the divided regions of Jammu and Kashmir could eventually be just a line on the map, if people, goods and services could flow freely.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan should desist from its restrictive positive list of freely traded goods and change to a more liberal negative list as expected by MFN and SAFTA rules. India is fast becoming the prime south-Asian geopolitical player and it is high time that the UN Security Council admitted the largest democracy in the world to its ranks as a permanent member. China is our second largest trading partner, but the EU does not share the same fundamental values with it as we do with India. That fact needs greater recognition in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from Britain, with our traditional links to India, I commend the Karim report and call on the Commission to develop a much deeper political and economic India-EU relationship culminating in a bilateral free trade agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I should like to touch on another matter. Obviously we all support the development of a strategic partnership with India. India is a strong emerging economy, a new geostrategic pole in Asia as a whole. However, if this relationship is also to be to the benefit of the European Union, it is not enough for us to welcome the statistical advantage which the European Union has over India in terms of balance of trade, in terms of direct foreign investment and in terms of the transfer of technology. We also need a common strategy for the European Union which will go beyond the individual national interests of the Member States. The recent Mittal-Arcelor case demonstrated that we must not continue at European level to follow this division between the individual interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">India, as we have said, is a very important factor. However, we must also see the other side. India at the moment has signed a nuclear energy agreement with the United States, which shapes a new framework and a new power correlation in Asia. We must call for India to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is vital to our future relations with India.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must understand that India bears a serious share of the responsibility for the failure of the Doha Round within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. It is India that is abusing the anti-dumping rules; it is India that is using social and environmental dumping. All these issues must be put to India if we really want an operational, effective and democratic multilateral trade system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We neglect the relationship with India, with its opportunities for both India and Europe, to our mutual cost.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, if the EU concentrates more of its efforts on economic policy instead of other distractions, I see the potential for a massive free-trading alliance. The United Kingdom, with its historic links, will play a key role in this development. I am therefore delighted that the British Conservative Leader, David Cameron, is devoting particular attention to relations with India. He seized the opportunity while with the business community in Mumbai recently to set out his views on globalisation. He also touched on the challenge of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is the curse of our age. If afflicts many European countries. It has become a tragic fact of life in India as well, not just in Kashmir but in Mumbai where 200 people were murdered in July and in Malegaon on 8 September 2006, where some 40 people were killed. The precise responsibility for these attacks is still unclear, but there is strong suspicion of external involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Post-9/11, Pakistan has helped the democracies to fight terrorism along its western border with Afghanistan, but it has done precious little to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on its eastern border with India or to control the extremist madrassas that provide the hotbed in which terrorists are cultivated.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to proceed with the welcome and ongoing peace process between India and Pakistan, Pakistan must implement the solemn assurances it has given to stop all cross-border terrorism and to deliver on the words of President Musharraf in this Parliament on 12 September 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As one of the great democracies, India attracts the rage of extremists. This threat can be defeated only by the concerted efforts of our nations and agencies working together in close cooperation.</p>

Two years ago, Parliament and the Commission opened a new chapter in relations between the Union and India, calling them a strategic partnership. At that time, I represented the European Parliament on a mission to India to prepare for the summit, confident that India was to become a strategic partner for us.</p>
<p class="contents">It seemed an obvious choice. The two largest democracies in the world account together for over 1.5 million people, and are in a position to create a new world economic order. At the time, we promised each other growth in terms of mutual investments, trade exchanges, youth exchanges and cooperation between businesses and institutions of higher education. That all seemed eminently sensible. Are we working towards it? The European Union wants to keep its place at the head of the world pack, though it is currently falling somewhat behind. Surely, therefore, its most important partner and market ought to be a country with a population of a billion, sustained economic growth above 7%, and where 50% of the population is under 20 years of age?</p>
<p class="contents">Has this become a reality? Unfortunately, it has not. What became of our strategy for youth exchange and investment? It never came about because a couple of countries took it into their heads that Russia should be our strategic partner. Russia is a country with a population of over 150 million, where the average age is close to 50; a country that is prepared to blackmail Europe by threatening to cut off gas and energy supplies. I call on Parliament and the Commission to review their policy and remain true to the agreements signed within the framework of a strategic partnership between the Union and India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sixty-five per cent of the population are farmers, and almost 70% of them live in rural areas. Although India comes close to the top of the list in terms of gifted engineers, IT specialists and scientists, about one third of its people are illiterate, and a large proportion of them are living in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of cooperation, these contrasts represent a unique mix of advantages for India, as it can draw on both an unskilled and a highly qualified cheap labour force. India has a population of over 1 billion and is the fourth largest economy in the world. Therefore, it ought to be an attractive partner for the Union where trade and investment are concerned. This potential is not fully exploited by European Union companies, which seem to have a strong preference for China. The Union’s trade with India amounts to less than 20% of its trade with China. These figures suggest that there is a great deal of under-exploited potential, but it is essential for the high duties on goods imported into India from the European Union to be lowered and for non-tariff barriers to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has already declared itself in favour of significant concessions within the framework of WTO negotiations. The Indian authorities should strive to limit bureaucracy, as it hampers foreign investment. The lack of investment in transport and energy particularly hinders development, although these could be attractive areas for foreign investment. The Union could draw on its past experience to help resolve the problems associated with the significant imbalance in regional development in India, where the west and south of the country differ greatly from the east and the north.</p>
<p class="contents">As we develop trade relationships, we must also promote respect for human rights in India. This is an important subject which should be raised at the forthcoming summit in October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I come from one of the new Member States and I can definitely confirm that direct foreign investment has played a significant role in the current dynamic economic growth that we have experienced in Central and Eastern Europe. Indeed, the same applies to India, which is the third most attractive country in the world in terms of foreign investment, with Europe being one of the biggest investors, accounting for investments of more than EUR 1 billion in 2004. Despite this positive trend and many other improvements, however, foreign investors in India continue to face considerable problems. They have to struggle with municipal, regional and national bureaucracy, with oblique and frequently changing regulations, to the point where they are completely unable to invest in many sectors, one example being agriculture. I should like to call on the Indian authorities to alleviate this situation and to make it easier for foreign investors to enter the Indian market. As evidenced by the successful example of Central and Eastern Europe, this will be beneficial not only for investors but also for the countries into which investment flows, which in this case means India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Only last week, on 19 September 2006, the EU-India High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the 13 October 2006 EU-India Summit and concluded that an expanded trade partnership should be developed through the negotiation of a broad-based trade and investment agreement. This forms the basis for the High Level Trade Group's recommendation to the EU-India Summit. It augurs well for an agreement at the summit that there is a strong case for launching bilateral FTA negotiations and that the parties are ready to take the necessary steps to start negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The areas forming the basis of bilateral EU-India relations, as covered by the three EU-India Subcommittee meetings, range from economic policy, dialogue and cooperation, including on industrial policy, science and technology, finance and monetary affairs, the environment, clean development and climate change, energy cooperation, information and communication technologies, civil aviation, maritime transport, space technology, agriculture and marine policy, customs, employment and social policy, business cooperation and development cooperation, to trade and investment and the bringing together of peoples and cultures. Many of those areas will no doubt form the subject of discussions at the EU-India Business Summit on 12 October 2006 and the Political Summit on 13 October 2006, with a view to making progress in all areas of EU-India relations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in our mutual interest to build on a rich history of experience and partnership with India. The issue of the free trade agreement with India presents us with a number of possibilities. An agreement with India would present various advantages, such as the consolidation of the European Union's privileged position in an important and growing market. India is the only major emerging economy with the European Union as both its largest trading partner and its largest investor. Whilst there have been sizeable reforms, access to India's market is still very restricted, with applied tariffs in certain sectors at over 30% and many caps on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector. The reduction of tariffs for EU companies and the liberalisation of trade in services would secure access to a rapidly growing market and thereby contribute to competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">A secondary benefit would be to lock in India's economic reforms to the advantage of its and the region's long-term economic growth. The visibility and economic benefits of an FTA with the European Union would support India's programme of reforms and provide a more stable investment climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Doha development agenda does not preclude bilateral free trade agreements, and the conclusion of such free trade agreements does not and would not prejudice the completion of the Doha development agenda. The European Union and India remain committed to the rules-based multilateral trading system. The successful outcome of the DDA multilateral trade negotiations remains their foremost trade-policy priority. India and the Union will continue to collaborate closely on mutual interests and to play leading roles regarding the DDA.</p>
<p class="contents">In the speech which Commissioner Mandelson delivered in Berlin on 18 September 2006, he indicated that the central strand of the October trade policy review would argue that the EU should seek to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral trading system with a new generation of bilateral free trade agreements with key growing markets.</p>
<p class="contents">While Europe continues to be highly competitive in global export markets, European companies are losing ground in the highest technology products and the fastest growing markets. In rapidly growing regions such as Asia, the European Union is underperforming. There is now a case for new bilateral free trade agreements designed to deliver more open markets. FTAs can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement and competition policy, that are not yet fully addressed by WTO rules. In this respect, the deepening of EU-India bilateral trade relations supports the larger multilateral trading regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as many of you have said during the discussion, strengthening EU-India relations represents a great hope: that of reducing the wealth gap existing in that country, of improving the conditions for workers and ensuring better standards of protection for all workers, in particular for women and children, and of improving the quality of life of the Indian people in general which, as has rightly been pointed out, is still such that 190 million people live on less than USD 1 a day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In contrast to last month’s debate on EU-China relations, his work and report have been a model of cooperation and consensus and my Group and I will be supporting his report. I only have to apologise that I will be absent for tomorrow’s vote, as I will be attending the Labour Party Conference in Manchester.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one general comment and two specific points on the report. First, we in the PSE Group do not want any hint that a bilateral FTA can substitute for a successful completion of the Doha Development Round. We know India is committed in this regard, but not all MEPs share that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while I offered a guarded welcome to back liberalisation, I share some of Mr Markov’s concerns as to the social impact on small farmers and businesses as preferential lending will end. If Mr Markov’s amendment had been more judiciously phrased it would have gained my support.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I do not welcome India’s involvement in ITER. I believe the whole ITER Programme is mistaken and would have been delighted if it had gone to Japan so they would have wasted more of their money and we less of ours. I can only commiserate with the people of India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having had the privilege to visit India on a number of occasions, I have been deeply impressed by the rate of economic development there over recent years and particularly in key 21st century industries such as information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased at the progress which was made in building dialogue at the sixth India-EU summit last year. Improving economic and trade relations will prove to be of mutual benefit to both the EU and India, but it is essential that a key objective of our contribution to economic development is the eradication of poverty. This must be maintained as a top priority of our strategic partnership. I congratulate the rapporteur on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
