<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, this Parliament has been trying to make the European Commission aware of the increasingly worrying situation of European beekeeping since the end of the 1980s.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, we managed to get the Commission to move a little, resulting in this ‘decaffeinated’ regulation to improve the production and marketing of honey, with an allocation of EUR 15 to 16 million, depending on the year, for all 15 Member States. The Commission has never acted on this Parliament’s unanimous requests to take more appropriate measures to save European beekeeping, such as the pollen-gathering premium.</p>
<p class="contents">For several years now, beekeeping has been faced with new problems, in particular the loss of hives because when bees have gathered pollen from certain crops they lose their sense of direction and that is just as dangerous, Commissioner, as when politicians lose the plot. Since the Commission is turning a deaf ear to our repeated warnings despite the Council having explicitly asked it, on 18 February this year, to develop its action in this field in line with Parliament’s demands, we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to ask for this oral question to be placed on the agenda with a debate and resolution on the new difficulties being encountered by European beekeeping, a resolution on which we will vote on 9 October.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 April this year, the Committee on Agriculture held a hearing on these new difficulties. In several Member States, beekeeping is in fact facing problems of large-scale mortality within bee colonies, especially in France, Mr Barnier. Among other things, this mortality is thought to be linked to the use of certain systemic insecticides present in the seed pellets of certain large-scale crops, principally sunflower and maize. Given that Article 174 of the Treaty on European Union, which is concerned with environmental policy, enshrines the precautionary principle as the founding principle, I think that this principle ought to be followed when there are both serious risks and uncertainties. As perhaps you know, Einstein said that if the bee disappeared from the surface of the earth, humanity would disappear two years later.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore faced with a great problem today, as I said. Beekeepers in many regions of different Member States have been observing increased mortality rates among bees for several years now. The symptoms are different from those caused by the weather, for example, but they coincide with the use of new generations of neurotoxic systemic active substances used for pelleting on large-scale crops close to the hives. That is where the uncertainty lies: both the hearing we had at the end of April and the comments and statements by my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development show that scientists do not agree.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must face the problem, not sidestep it. Let us set up a committee of experts to get us out of this uncertainty. Obviously, we need to avoid having double standards on the pretext of economic interests, interests which are massive, it is true: there are billions at stake. But neither politicians nor scientists should be controlled by the interests of the powerful financial groups that have been harassing us constantly, here and in Brussels, for weeks. The experts must work completely objectively and transparently, in a peaceful environment, and they must give us reliable and objective answers.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not hide from you that this week I received a very interesting report from the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study of Disorders of Bees, which is made up of eminent scientists. That report officially records the presence of doses of substances I previously mentioned as having been found in pollen. It has been reported to me that the firm Bayer itself, naming no names, was astonished by this new evidence. To quote just one of these findings: the use of Gaucho for pelleting sunflower seed results in a significant risk for bees of different ages. As with sunflower, the concentration ratio for the Gaucho pelleting of maize seed proves worrying given the consumption of pollen.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action to establish the real causes of the worrying rate of mortality among bees. In the meantime, our beekeepers need help, more funds to cope with this new crisis, whatever its origin. I hope that the Commission will move this time, that it will take our demands seriously, that it will see that serious studies are made to get to the bottom of this crisis. Meanwhile, as I said, we must take measures to prevent the disappearance of beekeepers with all the harmful ecological consequences that this would entail. That is why, Commissioner, we are asking the Commission to kindly give a clear answer to the three specific questions we have put to you in the course of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addressing me, you said these concerns were also felt in the country of which I am still a citizen. It so happens that in my previous positions – I have not forgotten – I had to dialogue and act with the people responsible for beekeeping, often in the way you desire. I do also understand, from the words you used, your dissatisfaction and your expectations. Nevertheless, that is a long way from saying that we are trying to sidestep the issue, that we are turning a deaf ear or that we have lost the plot. So I am going to try and give a serious and lucid answer to your three questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning first to Parliament’s decisions about taking account of the effects on bees and public health of persistent systemic insecticides, we have indeed noted those decisions. However, the Commission wishes to stress that any such effect is already taken into account in the evaluation of insecticides required under the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market. Member States are not allowed to authorise a plant protection product if it has an unacceptable effect on non-target organisms such as bees.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, an assessment of any possible effect of residues on public health is a prior condition for setting maximum levels of pesticide residues in food.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes that most of the concerns expressed in this regard relate to two insecticides that are currently being evaluated, Mrs Lulling. Pending the outcome of those evaluations, no decision concerning those substances has yet been taken at Community level, but the Commission is aware of risk management measures being applied in at least one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding investigations into this subject, the directive does not require the studies to be conducted by the Commission itself. On the other hand, the Commission is fully informed of the studies necessary in order to demonstrate the acceptability of particular substances. It has been provided with information on the decline in bee populations in some Member States, as you yourself have solemnly emphasised. At present, we are told, there is no scientific proof that this decline is due to a single factor such as pesticide use.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also informed of research currently being undertaken by the Member States, by industry and by scientific associations under the watchful eye of the associations. The Commission is itself following the matter very closely. It will, of course, continue to monitor developments and will take appropriate measures in due course should that appear necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Lulling, on the matter of aids under Council Regulation No 1221/97, the Commission cofinanced national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey to the tune of 50% during the 1999/2000 marketing year. The French programme, for example, included a study of the effects of plant protection products on bees. The programmes for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 marketing years also provide aids for the reconstitution of bee stocks. Finally, I would like to point out that if a Member State wishes, the Commission is, of course, willing to look at the possibility of increasing the amounts allocated to this within the overall budget, but that is, of course, up to the national authorities whose responsibility it is to make such a request.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the most definite and most precise answers I can give you on the three points raised in your oral question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank her very warmly for this commitment, because we should be aware that this has been a matter of concern to the European Parliament for decades. Back in the 1980s, the Bavarian Member of Parliament and pan-European, Heinrich Aigner, who sadly is no longer with us, brought together hundreds of Bavarian beekeepers to inject some impetus into this issue. We have been working on it for 30 years, and unfortunately we have not made a great deal of progress. I have to say quite clearly, Commissioner, that I am grateful to you for your precise answers and for taking this important issue so seriously, because an ecological crisis is slowly developing in this sector. In Bavaria and Austria huge numbers of bee colonies died in the spring frosts, but also of course because of insecticides and diseases, and we are feeling the ecological effects very keenly, for example with our fruit. That is why I really believe that now is the time to promote something that is under serious threat, namely passing on beekeeping to the next generation. A very high proportion of beekeepers are old, because fewer and fewer people from the younger generation are prepared to take on this arduous, but ecologically necessary, task, not least because the financial rewards are ever more meagre. That is why I should like to say quite clearly that I – like Mrs Lulling – call for all measures to be taken to support the marketing of natural European honey ahead of cheap, undeclared artificial honey, with which we have repeatedly had to contend, or honey from abroad. I would also call for something that is always the subject of some ridicule, but which is ecologically important, namely the pollination premium for colonies of bees, so that we promote this activity by giving beekeepers more support.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for your examples from France, which plays a leading role in this sector. Your country also has a former agriculture minister for president and it is a country, which, thank God, takes healthy eating and delicious food very seriously. I actually believe that we in Europe should finally see this issue, which is regarded by some perhaps as a bit of a joke, for what it is, namely a health issue and a prerequisite for a functioning environment and ecological system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, in putting this oral question on the pressing problem of the large-scale mortality of bees to the Commission, my colleagues Dominique Souchet and Astrid Lulling are once again sounding the alarm and I back them strongly in this. Quite extraordinary problems of declining bee colonies have been observed in France for several years now, since 1995 to be precise. The situation is getting worse by the year, the geographical area and the number of hives affected is constantly growing and now we can say that many countries of Europe are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems on investigation that this bee mortality is not the result of a conventional pathology. Several other hypotheses have been examined, such as climate, general pollution or the incorrect use of plant protection products. While these may sometimes carry some of the responsibility, however, they are far from accounting for the full scale of the disaster. On this point I do not agree with the opinion you have just expressed, Commissioner. According to experts and professionals, one principal cause has in fact been identified: the environment around the hives, when it includes fields of honey plants, colza, sunflower, maize, the seed of which has been treated with insecticides of the Gaucho or Regent type.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the industrial manufacturers reply that the link has not been formally established, but experience clearly shows that the disorders afflicting bees – loss of sense of direction, shaking, inability to gather pollen and finally death – correlate perfectly with the presence nearby of crops grown from seed treated with Gaucho or Regent. The more observations are made, the more these findings are confirmed. However, nothing decisive has yet come from the authorities apart from reassuring words, the launching of studies and a few limited measures such as the temporary withdrawal of the authorisation for Gaucho to treat sunflower seed in France.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, again at the instigation of Dominique Souchet and Astrid Lulling, the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture arranged a hearing on the subject on 28 April last. The lessons we have drawn from that are alarming because the problem affecting bees could well be only the most visible part of a wider problem affecting pollinating insects, entomofauna and soil fauna. Gaucho and Regent molecules could therefore be harmful not only to bees but to a much wider environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not stop there, either. Since these molecules are present in agricultural products used in food or animal feed, we should also be concerned about our own health. That is why, faced with this risk of widespread poisoning of the ecosystem – and perhaps of man – we are insisting that the precautionary principle be applied. I heard the Commission’s answers to Mr Souchet’s and Mrs Lulling’s oral question just now. I believe it is taking too much of a wait-and-see attitude. In our view, the precautionary principle means banning the use of the products in question, at least on all honey plants. Measures should also be taken to compensate beekeepers and enable them to repopulate their hives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contrary to what may have been said, the Commission takes very seriously this question that Mrs Lulling has vehemently and competently defended and that Mr Souchet put with her. Frankly, if some of you have the impression that no serious scientific work has been done on plant protection products and their consequences for bees, then I believe you are mistaken. Work on the substances in question has been going on for several years. The International Commission on Plant-Bee Relations, whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees, has just held an international symposium in Bologna on the subject. Its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple, single cause. Other potential sources – certain parasitoses, certain farming practices and weather conditions – may have harmful effects on the health of bees just as much as plant protection and veterinary products.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the ecosystem, Mr Berthu. I would remind you that I have a longstanding commitment in this area. As a former environment minister in my country, I am sensitive to this question. The symposium agreed to form a working party to look into the deteriorating health of bees. The working party will report to the next symposium, which will be held in 2005. I confirm that the Commission will be following this work closely and will draw a number of definite conclusions from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Posselt, whom I thank for his opinion, regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping. I simply want to confirm that national programmes concerning honey provide funding for technical assistance to encourage young people to become beekeepers and improve their results.</p>

This report is at your disposal, Commissioner, and we shall meet again on 9 October, when we will be discussing the draft resolution on which the Committee on Agriculture will be voting next week in conclusion of this debate.</p>
