<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Commissioner Byrne, in this directive on the marketing of compound feed we find our old problem lurking, namely the question of open declarations. It is gratifying for me personally to be able to serve as rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, since this problem has been with us now for decades. As Mr Böge knows, in our time in the <span class="italic">Landjugend</span>, the young farmers’ association in Germany, we used to discuss this, because there were open declarations at one time. They were then abolished to suit the interests of the feed industry. The computer put together the cheapest feed mix at current prices, and so that the consumers – in this case the farmers – were not irritated by the constant changes in ingredients, the required information was reduced to the basic components, which were the carbohydrate, protein and fat contents. That certainly covered the substance of the compound feed. The computer worked this out, but it was no longer clear which ingredients made up this substance. We always stressed the need for openness. Then we would hear the most specious of arguments – it was impossible to prove, it was too difficult, it would distort competition – all the things we are hearing again today.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, in the Committee of Inquiry on BSE, we demanded for the first time, and here I quote from a recommendation made by the Temporary Committee of Inquiry on 6 February 1997, "... the inclusion in labelling of a mandatory explicit declaration for feedingstuffs by their manufacturers, which should facilitate the clear identification of components and of the origin of ingredients, and on user instructions." This was our view, but the recommendation was not adopted by the Commission. We then pressed this point again in the temporary committee which was created with a view to following up the recommendations on BSE, but the Commission asserted in 1998 that declarations were already open. Not even the BSE scandal could compel it to subordinate the interests of the compound-feed industry to those of public health. Then we had the dioxin scandal on top of that, and it was fortuitous that the Commissioners had to introduce themselves to Parliament at that very time, as you will no doubt recall, Mr Byrne. And those who drafted your remarks on this point and the remarks of the other Commissioners were wise enough to include an indication that you were in favour of open declarations. We immediately started probing. We asked whether you really meant it. Yes, you did mean it, and now we have a draft on the table, a draft that is entirely in line with our wishes. We have tabled a few small amendments. I should also like to thank Mrs Roth­Behrendt, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We accepted the bulk of your amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but the substance of the Commission draft is fine, and we shall support it in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">The compound-feed industry, however, has been trying yet again to exert influence through the Council and to overturn the principle of open declarations. I assume that they will not succeed this time. What is most clearly apparent is that components are no longer lumped together into categories. That has been the worst part of the present regime, because it meant, for example, that the term ‘fats’ could cover all sorts of fat and that there was no indication at all as to the origins of the fat content. The same applied to protein. In the Committee of Inquiry on BSE, we had always objected to the evident inclusion in feed mixes of animal protein, in the form of animal meal, not as a means of meeting the required percentage of protein but to reduce production costs and to increase the nutrient content as cheaply as possible. And we all know the results of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne, we are highly satisfied. This is a report and a regulatory procedure based on codecision. I hope that we shall reach agreement with the Council and that the final outcome in the form of our joint draft, which the Commission presented and to which we have added, will be upheld, so that we can say, "Yes, it took years, it took decades, but open declarations are now enshrined in the law of the European Union". I should find that particularly gratifying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, for instance, I learned that, at the time when my esteemed colleagues Graefe zu Baringdorf and Böge were in the <span class="italic">Landjugend</span> – in other words until very recently, in a manner of speaking – there were open declarations. So that in itself has already made my morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur from the committee which was ultimately entrusted with responsibility for this report, said that we have long been pressing for this open declaration and that we have redoubled our exhortations to the Commission on the marketing of compound feed since the BSE episode. He rightly praised the Commission for its more or less prompt fulfilment of its mandates. The Commission's proposal is sound, and I am convinced that we shall muster enough agreement within the House on the few amendments to be able to stand up to the Council on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely fail to comprehend why the manufacturers of compound feed – who have spoken to many of us, as you know – believe that resistance against open declarations will achieve anything. It will get them nowhere. As we have all been saying in our speeches, whether here in the House or in our home constituencies, we must begin to win back the public trust that we have lost, and we must be unstinting in our efforts to do so. That entails a host of measures. One such measure is the introduction of open declarations, and an open declaration is not merely an indication of the percentage of various content categories or generic classifications but clear and precise details of the ingredients contained in the feed mix. It is unacceptable to have ‘starch’, ‘fats’ or ‘protein’ on the packaging; the manufacturer must state <span class="italic">which</span> protein and <span class="italic">which </span>fats are in the mix. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf made that quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need more than that, which is why both the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee have stated once again, rather in the fashion of a Tibetan prayer wheel, that we need a white list. We need a white list of the additives and ingredients that are authorised for use in feed mixes. The Commission has pledged itself to work on this list and has also said it is not something that can be done in a couple of days. We do not expect that either. What we do expect, however, is that the Commission will give us regular updates and that it has an approximate timetable for the accomplishment of this task. After all, it would be unacceptable if, in the meantime, we were plunged back into a situation in which the Commission had to write to the Member States to find out how the Directive on sewage sludge was being interpreted. We will have none of that! We must have a clear and unequivocal white list, and both committees – the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee – have reiterated that point. It naturally means a large investment of time and money in monitoring, which is why both committees have stated that manufacturers also have an obligation to provide evidence. This obligation involves furnishing precise details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs on request, and is designed to shift some of the burden of proof as well as to minimise the cost of monitoring in the Member States. We naturally have no wish to spend vast amounts of time and money on monitoring and to be constantly setting off to conduct inspections all over the place. So if we were to do what we intend, if we were to implement it quickly and then pass quickly through the codecision procedure too, that would certainly be a huge step forward, and I feel sure that we shall be very strong and united in our dealings with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The words of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf certainly illustrated the aptness of that proverb to the present situation. Besides the week's major topics, namely our discussions, decisions and votes on enlargement and institutional reform, there have been other subjects that the public has also been following with interest, subjects on which the position of the general public can also be said to have moved perceptibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, public awareness of food-safety issues in particular has heightened considerably, and this naturally extends to animal feed as well as human foodstuffs. Just think of BSE or dioxin, and you will know what I mean. The discussions on the Paulsen reports, of course, clearly illustrated this. The marketing of animal feed, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the trading of animal feed, also engenders this awareness. When mixing takes place, in the case of compound feedingstuffs, I believe the need for caution is even greater, whether these compounds are functional foods or feed mixes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of these products, more detailed labelling is expected. Higher priority must be given to verifiability. The mandatory open declaration is essential, and the greatest possible degree of transparency is necessary throughout the supply chain. I believe, too, that transparency will ultimately strengthen competition; it stands to reason that transparent competition creates a greater incentive to manufacture the best possible mixes.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers quite simply have to know more precisely what is in their compound feedingstuffs, and they must also be able to find out, at least on request, the percentage content of each ingredient. That is their right as purchasers as well as being consistent with the interests of consumers. Equally important, of course, is the food-safety aspect – beef is another issue here – and traceability. This, at least, is well embedded in the proposal. The amendments make the proposal better still. The PPE-DE Group approves Amendments Nos 1 to 5 but cannot support Amendment No 6. The question of genetically modified cereals should be regulated elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the amended Graefe zu Baringdorf report and the legislative resolution. Let me express our thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and to Mrs Roth-Behrendt. Nevertheless, it is essential that we continue to stand firm.</p>

Whether this will be intentional, in other words a criminal act, or accidental is not the subject of today's debate. If this does happen, however, it will be crucial to know which amounts of which contaminated primary product have entered the feed in question. An indication of components, summarised according to category and listed by descending order of percentage weight, would not, in our view, suffice for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore absolutely imperative that full details of all the primary products contained in compound feedingstuffs, together with the percentage volume of each, should be a statutory requirement. The Socialist Group endorses the statements made by the rapporteur in his conclusions on the open declaration of feed ingredients. This mandatory explicit declaration must be part of a comprehensive safety system governing the production of animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Livestock feed is, after all, the main input in the production of meat. Defects in the safety and verification system increase the risk of further food scandals and ultimately lead to a loss of consumer confidence in meat as a food product. And it is always the farmer who suffers in the end. Farmers not only have to be able to rely on the information provided by the feedingstuffs industry; they must also be able to check, on the basis of the declaration, which volumes of which raw materials are contained in livestock feed. We believe that complete transparency for farmers is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for their contributions, and I hope that the Council will adopt a constructive position on this matter, so that we can jointly arrive at a transparent system of declarations for feedingstuffs.</p>

I also expect the Commission to stipulate the necessary measures along with a strict timetable in order to ensure that the directive is applied in the Member States of the Union. The basis for the introduction of open declarations, in other words the full listing of all feed materials, differs extremely widely between Member States. The standards are scarcely comparable, let alone transferable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long production chain for compound feedingstuffs, there are sharply divergent degrees of interest in the traceability of feed materials. The BSE scandal was the worst and most notorious example. Farmers are still suffering today from that utterly criminal failure to protect consumers. As we have seen, it took years to rectify matters. Let me say categorically that the application of the numerous necessary rules and regulations on the control and monitoring of feedingstuffs must, in my opinion, proceed from the premise that transparency for the consumer is paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">When it produces its own report, the Commission can prove that transparency is not a modern word for bureaucratic procedures and that danger exists, since the legal provisions on food safety are supposed to cover the entire soil-plant-animal cycle. The report does not make it immediately clear to everyone precisely whom or what this transparency is intended to benefit. Let me finish by stressing that the report, like the labelling of beef, will come down on the side of the consumer more than on that of the production chain. Given the surplus production in Europe, this is the safer bet and will pay dividends in the long run. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, of course, all due to the BSE tragedy that turned into a real saga, with several episodes. Mr Böge dealt with the episode of the committee of inquiry in 1997, there was the episode of the ban on British beef, the episode of the labelling of meat and now we have the episode of labelling animal feedingstuffs. Of course, farmers have the right to know what their cows are eating and the right to know whether their pigs are eating car sump oil, which contains dioxins.</p>
<p class="contents">Food must therefore be labelled to show the precise contents. This is a simple thing, but for ten years, we have sat and twiddled our thumbs. Admittedly, there are labels that tell half the truth, stating “contains oil”, but that could mean fish oil, vegetable oil, tallow or grease. Common sense, as our rapporteur said, would suggest that labelling should make a clean sweep and list all the ingredients. On this issue, however, we have been told that the intellectual property of manufacturers’ formulas must be protected, that monitoring compliance would be difficult, that the label would be covered with the list of nutritional values and raw ingredients and that the contents would vary according to the market in which they were sold. In short, then, people have tried to win some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have found a good solution, although nothing has been said about animal feedingstuffs containing GMOs, such as soya flour. Nor has anything been said about the responsibility of manufacturers, particularly in Britain, who were primarily responsible. Even if we are pleased with this progress, however, how can we forget that before we finally adopted measures it took ten years and 80 deaths, and in two years’ time we may well yet discover a zoonosis, a health disaster?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know, Mr Byrne, if the European Commission is at risk of dying from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, but given the slow pace of your lives, I can take pleasure in the fact that you will surely not die of a heart attack. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it addresses a long-standing concern of Parliament, which has at times, in 1997 and 1999, asked for a review of current legislation on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs. We all agree that there is a need for compulsory labelling that clearly indicates the various components of compound feedingstuffs and their nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not, of course, complicate matters and demand unnecessary details on the labels, but we shall demand everything that is essential, such as an explicit, open declaration strictly indicating the percentage of each component and its intrinsic nature. As we all know, these measures are fundamental for increasing consumer confidence. There is in fact a general lack of confidence, which is particularly marked in relation to intensive production processes, not only in meat production but also in fish farming. It is possible, through clear, transparent and responsible labelling, to give consumers this confidence. This subject was in fact discussed during the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, and the conclusion was that the Council’s position was unfortunately rather timid in this respect, rather fainthearted, showing that ultimately the ministers had not learnt much from the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that the Commission and the Council should fight for these same rules to apply to all partners worldwide, especially in the framework of the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the interests of farmers and consumers, we need clear and transparent rules for animal feed too, but it should be said that farmers are always the first to suffer when abuses occur. As far as the directive on undesirable products and substances in animal nutrition is concerned, let me say from the outset that we need a more workable solution here which strikes a fair balance between the interests of producers and those of consumers. We must create a realistic statutory framework. Contaminants which affect human and animal health are unacceptable. You know I come from a Member State where very high and strict standards are imposed, which I fully support, and those standards have certainly proved their worth.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as checks on feedingstuffs are concerned, I should like to state that the problem is not so much the lack of a European legal framework as the failure of the individual Member States to transpose the existing provisions. I cannot but warmly welcome the pressure for the creation of a European information system for food crises, the standardised transmission of information on the monitoring and safety of animal feed and the dissemination of information on cases of contamination and of damage to public health and the environment. I take a more critical view, however, of the escape clause which would give the Commission the scope to take measures of its own without consulting the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to say a word or two on the conflict of competence between the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee. I believe the specialised knowledge and the powers of judgement of the members of the Agriculture Committee on farming matters, and hence on animal nutrition too, are beyond question and that the Agriculture Committee is therefore the body which is best qualified to arrive at a practical and practicable solution that the farmers in question will apply and which consumers will understand. For that reason, subjects such as animal feed really ought to be dealt with under the direction of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. What we feed our livestock is just as important to us farmers as it is to the consumers who subsequently buy our meat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal falls within the framework of the legislation intended to strengthen the rules on feedingstuffs, included in the White Paper on food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Parliament, as well as the Commission, demands mandatory labelling which specifies the composition – as a percentage by weight, as Mr Cunha said –, the quantities and the origin of the ingredients of the feedingstuffs, rather than indicating the categories of the ingredients with no further detail, such as, for example, by proteins or by oils and fats, which has had so much to do with previous scandals such as the cases of BSE and dioxins.</p>

But let us begin with the good news.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal to lend more transparency to the information given on labels and on feed content, so that everyone knows where they stand, is a step in the right direction. It is also what we want, namely trust between the producer and consumer. The tighter measures which the rapporteur announced in his report and which encompass, for example, an exhaustive list of products, for which he calls on the Commission for help, is an interesting proposal and will only reinforce this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A second, necessary step in this process is to have exact data at one’s disposal. It is unfortunate, however, that we are still not, in fact, taking matters one step further and establishing certain labelling obligations with regard to energy and foodstuffs, too. This is the good news.</p>
<p class="contents">The bad news is that those who tamper with cattle feed will not – now or in future – specify on the label whether the product contains dioxin or substances which have not been effectively processed. That means that in Europe, there is definitely room for improvement with regard to policy on enforcement, but also on penalties, and it means that whoever tampers with animal feed or food commits a crime. You could say that you can put anything on paper, but in the final analysis, power will also need to reside in enforcement and penalties when the rules are broken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to note that, with this legislation, Europe is probably going a great deal further than many other parts of the world. It imports a great deal of its cattle feed from the developing countries, among others, and the question remains of how we can put our legislation on the agenda at WTO level and how we can solve this problem in an adequate manner, because it very definitely creates a difference in cost price compared to other parts of the world, and this will also need to be given due attention within the Commission and in future discussions with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased about that.</p>
<p class="contents">As stressed in the report by these two committees, this proposal was initiated by the European Parliament out of a concern to improve both traceability and the provision of information through the labelling of compound-feeding stuffs. The Commission proposal does not enjoy the unanimous support of all parties concerned. In the Council, a very substantial majority of Member States is opposed to the introduction of an obligation to systematically indicate on labels the precise composition of the compound feedingstuffs intended for productive livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">If a compromise were to be reached, it would be highly desirable to give stock farmers the opportunity to obtain all the information they desire on the composition of the feedingstuffs used to feed their animals. In my opinion, this is a legitimate right to information which must be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the amendments presented are concerned, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 5 that improve the Commission proposal. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 2 calling on the Commission to present, forthwith, a proposal setting out an exhaustive list of the materials authorised for feeding animals. I must stress that the Commission is in no way opposed to the actual principle of drawing up an exhaustive list of materials. The Commission is convinced of the usefulness of a positive list. In this connection, I would like to quote from the White Paper on Food Safety which states "The materials which may or may not used in animal feed production, including animal by-products, need to be clearly defined." A positive list of feed materials would give the clearest response to the current lack of definition of feed materials, however, it goes on to state: "This task is complex and time-consuming. In the short term, the current negative list needs to be rapidly expanded and the Commission is committed to working towards a positive list over the medium term."</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the timetable, there is no way that a proposal on a positive list of materials can be envisaged before the end of 2002. The procedure whereby this can be done is the amendment of 1996/25 to convert the current non-exhaustive list of feed materials into an exhaustive positive list. This can be done by codecision under Article 152. Any updating of that list would be accomplished by comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will understand that the Commission cannot agree to give commitments on timescales which cannot be reasonably kept. Finally, in relation to Amendment No 6, this amendment is not acceptable as it falls outside the scope of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
