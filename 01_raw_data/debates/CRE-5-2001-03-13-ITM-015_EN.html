<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, it is the custom to start with thanks and I, as rapporteur, have every reason to do that now. The directive on public access to environmental information was already an excellent and ambitious proposal when it left the hands of the Commission. Along the way we have enjoyed excellent cooperation, and it has been easy for us to understand each other’s objectives. Furthermore, the representatives of the Council – I refer to both those of France and Sweden – have been encouraging and well-informed about the matter. I am also grateful for the attitude adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I was delighted that all twenty-five of my amendments were adopted by the committee; moreover, there were some important additions contributed by committee members.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a report which is significant, not just for the individual citizen, but also for the Community’s environmental policy. Access to information is an important horizontal instrument in EU environmental policy, and the revision of the directive has taken a long time. The proposal for the directive has three principal aims: to benefit from the experience gained under the old directive dating from 1990 and to correct the shortcomings identified in it, to incorporate the relevant parts of the Aarhus Convention into the new directive, and to adapt the old directive to developments in information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that one of the most important factors in my own report is first the obligation to establish registers. It is a precondition of the viability of this directive. A member of the public must be able to know what documents are available and what authorities are responsible for what. I noted with satisfaction that Mr Cashman, in his own report on transparency, calls for exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I also focused on some details relating to the refusal to disclose information. If the request for information is denied on the grounds that it is incomplete the applicant must nevertheless be told when the information will be available and which authority is responsible. Another clarification regarding the refusal to disclose information concerns the exceptions in Article 4(2). An exception to these exceptions is emissions in connection with commercial and industrial confidentiality, which always have to be disclosed. I tabled an amendment that recommended the disclosure of information on emissions even when there was some other kind of data protection involved. The adverse effects of emissions do not depend on the nature of the work that produced them; from the point of view of public health and safety, it makes no difference whether the source is a public or commercial one.</p>
<p class="contents">I deemed it necessary to introduce a whole new article on the quality of environmental information. Quality is obviously a major factor when assessing the significance of the directive. In my study of the directive it hit me that no comprehensive harmonisation of emission measurement procedures had been called for in this connection. It does actually make a difference whether we measure emissions from a pipe or in a butterfly net a kilometre away. In other words, there must be information given on the methods used in taking measurements.</p>
<p class="contents">One awkward question in this directive concerned the definition of an authority: do the rules apply to the authorities in the conventional sense or do they also include a body that has been delegated to carry out an official task, such as a company which maintains possession of information legally entrusted to it by virtue of an agreement it has made with an authority? We have now found a format that, hopefully, will be appropriate for most Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a good deal of consensus regarding this directive. When I have rejected amendments, I have done so mainly because of considerations of style. This is a framework directive, and its purpose is not to wish the world all that is fine and good about transparency. As a legislative text is may also be more effective if it remains narrow in scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Some members of the committee wanted to tighten up the time limits set for the authorities to respond. The Commission’s proposal shortens the time limit to a month and, if the volume and complexity of the information required so demands, two months. In all cases, however, a reply is required as soon as possible. I still consider this to be a realistic objective, although, in some cases, shortening the time limit might even have a negative effect on the quality of the response. I do not therefore support the committee’s proposals for a more stringent attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Viewed generally, we can imagine this directive will set a standard for Member States regarding the transparency of environmental information. The amendment I tabled in Article 8(2) is based on the notion that the same standard should also apply to the EU institutions. In this way, this directive will positively promote transparency throughout the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also contributed the clause which says that the standards for Member States should also apply to the EU institutions. The contribution from my committee on practical arrangements incorporated in the final report includes a number of amendments which I am glad were taken up by the Environment Committee. I am talking for instance about the inclusion of nuclear fuel and energy and of financial as well as economic analyses, the establishment of accessible registers or lists of available information, the idea that the applicant cannot be charged more than a reasonable cost, which is the actual cost price of collecting the information, and the insistence that there must be a harm test for exceptions, i.e. harm must outweigh the benefits of disclosure.</p>
<p class="contents">But as far as the scope of the proposal is concerned, I am rather disappointed, if not surprised, at the suggestion that the UK Government, British Labour and Conservative Members sought to exclude private companies whose activities affect the environment. This is the kind of loophole that allowed the previous Conservative government to exempt the privatised water companies. Those amendments failed but I am concerned that the amendment which did go through on Article 2(2)(c) might limit the scope too much. One of the purposes of the new proposal was to close up these previous loopholes which allowed privatised utilities to escape the obligation. The Commission text clearly covered privatised utilities. Does the Commissioner think the amendments on Article 2(2)(c) that were adopted by the Environment Committee ensure that privatised companies which supply gas, electricity, water and so on will still be under the obligation to supply this information? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that what we are debating is a far-reaching study. This is because it affects citizens’ law and the development of European citizens’ rights, over and above States, regions and any other party with an interest in wielding power.</p>
<p class="contents">Exercising power by controlling information is as old as the hills. We must therefore ensure that control of information is not taken over by those in power and that the citizens have the right to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that where the environment is concerned, one of the main problems stems from the fact that as a consequence of the principle of subsidiarity environmental protection is solely in the hands of the citizens. The citizens need to be informed and the Commission must make a particular point of doing so in areas where subsidiarity applies. That will enable the citizens to defend their own rights and insist that their governments take the necessary action. The Commission must therefore make a great effort to obtain the relevant information for areas where subsidiarity applies. It must also strive to lay down the ground rules for information and insist that all countries be obliged to provide information at both State and regional level, regardless of how they conduct their policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent disasters are making it clear that the citizen increasingly has the right to manage the risks he is exposed to. He is also entitled to express his views, and request and demand commitments to safeguard his own interests in areas such as health.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in the interests of proper application of the principle of subsidiarity and its implementation we should not place power out of the citizens’ reach. Information is every citizen’s right. He needs to fully understand the relevant system, including any weaknesses. He will then be in a position to support it, make decisions pertaining to its finance and many other things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Free access to and the dissemination of transparent environmental information are the basic right of every citizen who cares about the quality of the environment in which he or she lives and works. The accessibility of the environmental data held by the authorities is crucial to raising public awareness and securing the trust and democratic involvement of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous shortcomings were identified during the application of Directive 90/313 and it therefore needs to be revised. In the light of the signature of the Aarhus Convention and progress in information technology, the Commission has submitted a new proposal for a directive which covers most of the aforementioned points. However, amendments have been proposed which seek to extend the Commission proposal even further. For example, the definition of public authorities must include agencies and legal persons acting on behalf of the public authorities. The directive relates to environmental information and must include information in all accessible forms, such as written, visual, aural etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Any person or organisation may request environmental information without needing to prove a legitimate interest. As regards the deadline by which the administration must respond to a request for environmental information, I think that a period of two weeks is long enough, so as to ensure that interested parties can use the information before it is out of date.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important that there should be no commitment as regards the provision of information and no exceptions in relation to particularly important issues, such as gas emissions, discharges, dumping and other releases into the environment. It is also essential, every time the public authorities refuse to disclose information, irrespective of whether or not this is based on an exception, that they give adequate reasons for their refusal. The directive stipulates that the public authorities may make a charge for supplying information. I think that this charge should be limited to the actual cost of reproducing the information, so as to facilitate the greatest possible public access to the information.</p>

The Commission produced a good proposal, and it has been improved since the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy went through it. I hope that it will be improved still further following the vote in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, our present and future environmental problems must be solved at all levels. Some issues are European and some are national but, to be honest, the vast majority will be local. It is only democratic that our citizens should be able to exercise influence, and it goes without saying that they should be entitled to all the information they need in order to perform their civic duties in society. That is why we should like to see Amendments 6, 16 and 30 adopted by Parliament tomorrow. These amendments set a limit of two weeks, and in difficult cases of four weeks, within which authorities and companies are to answer questions. This corresponds to Parliament’s position in what is known as the Cashman report on public access to documents in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that Amendments 19 and 20 should go through, stating that authorities are responsible for helping the individual citizen or organisation to obtain information. Quite simply, they must be given help in asking the right questions in the right places, both orally and in writing, and in finding answers to these. That is a service which authorities should obviously be required to provide in a democratic country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can say that we have here a model example of a committee really seeing its work through to the end and bringing to Parliament a virtually unanimous decision on a proposal in which differences of opinion, such as there are in this case, have been limited to a minimum. I would like to point out that we are actually talking about a very important review of the subject, which the Aarhus Convention set in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has now drafted a report that concerns the implementation of the first task of this Convention, which relates to the right of the public to have access to environmental information. The following tasks are then the right of the public to participate in decision-making and the right of the public to acquire rights in situations in which they are being treated inappropriately. It should be emphasised that this is not a matter of our wanting the authorities to show good will to our citizens, but that this is a question of an inalienable fundamental right, and our citizens must be able to exercise that right without being asked to justify why they want the information concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself was closely involved in the preparation of Mr Cashman’s report, and when I was familiarising myself with Mrs Korhola’s report I was wondering whether Mr Cashman’s report should not have a paragraph added to it stating that environmental and health-related information cannot be kept confidential even when it is classified as a trade secret. It may be that a lot of environmental and health-related information will be withheld from the public if such a line is not drawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To be entitled to access information on environmental issues is not only a right but also an issue of power. Where many environmental issues are concerned, the public’s interest in a good environment is often pitted against strong private financial interests. The right to information is basic to the ability to shape opinion and influence policy. That is why it is also a matter of democracy that people should be able to acquire insight into environmental issues in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are now discussing is largely based upon the Aarhus Convention, which we consider to be an unusually positive and far-sighted example of international cooperation in this area. The legislation we are now discussing does not cover the institutions of the EU, but these will be referred to in a later proposal. In view of the negotiations concerning public access to documents – in accordance with Article 255 – it unfortunately looks as though the result of these negotiations may be significantly worse than what was established in the Aarhus Convention where the environment is concerned, and such a result would in actual fact be quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to future regulations, it is also important that other institutions, too, should be fully covered by the Aarhus Convention, for example the European Investment Bank whose activities have quite a big effect upon the environment in different ways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, what I have to say on the Korhola report is linked to the Oomen-Ruijten and the Myller report and it is very timely indeed that this debate is taking place, especially when we are marking the tenth anniversary of the Earth Summit which was held in Rio in 1992. I use the words 'marking' very carefully because I do not think we can celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first Earth Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the United States and the European Union could not recently come to an agreement on the permitted level of future gas emissions is certainly an unwelcome development. I hope that the US and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of greenhouse gases. The fact of the matter is that the greater the reduction of greenhouse gases, the greater the effect it has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities, not only in Europe but world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware of the preparation of the European Union for the world summit on sustainable development which is being held in South Africa in the year 2002 and I support the four lines of action which have been drawn up by the European Commission in preparation for this world summit. The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of the economic development, to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency, promote sustainable use of water, land and energy as well as try to ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation is broken and this is best achieved under the framework of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after Rio, expectations have not been met. The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world. We ought to redouble all our efforts so as to be sure that next year's world summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a manner which protects existing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community Fifth Environmental Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution. Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environmental Action Programme would not be attained easily, the Commission has rightly decided on a step-by-step approach setting out its so-called interim environmental targets for the year 2010. The Environmental Committee will continue to play an important coordinating role in this regard and I would congratulate the rapporteur on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by Mrs Korhola, however, contains several pitfalls for everyone to clearly see. I particularly regret the fact that it is not more ambitious. I equally regret that this text only addresses the public’s access to documents and not the access of Members as well, who carry out work as part of their mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">As evidence of this, I would like to give an enlightening example, which I myself experienced. In February 2000, I had the impertinence to request the annual publication of the scientific, technical and financial balance sheet of the Life programme, which receives a package of EUR 613 million. In August 2000, when I still had not received anything, I contacted the Director-General for the Environment and the Secretary-General of the European Commission to find out some information on the Life programme – which saved Lake Grandlieu by the way – which appears to be stamped with the words ‘official secret’. To my absolute astonishment, they sent me just a few trivial pieces of information, telling me that the project’s detailed summary of expenditure contained personal details, which meant that I could not see it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know how communicating the purchase price of plots of land bought exclusively with public money constitutes a violation of an individual’s private life, rather than the legitimate monitoring of public funds that any self-respecting Member should be undertaking? It is also impossible to have access to the scientific studies carried out under the much-vaunted Life programme, for the simple reason that the Commission does not have them in its possession, which is the last straw. The Commission suggests that I contact the author of the document directly, who is in no way obliged to help me, and who, moreover, has not done so, which is hardly surprising, since the programme revealed a genuine ecological disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in order to avoid this kind of abuse that we shall vote in favour of this text which is a step in the right direction. However, how can we ever expect to achieve any sort of transparency in the use of Community funds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I would also like to congratulate them on having accepted the majority of contributions that we approved in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose draftsperson was Baroness Ludford.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has, quite rightly, been in the vanguard of the movement to create greater openness and transparency in the activities of public authorities, including access to documents. Access to environmental information should be regarded as one of the essential pillars of an effective environmental policy, because it helps to make the public more aware of environmental issues, thus improving environmental protection and the quality of the environment. It does this by facilitating more effective checks on whether Community environmental legislation is being fully and properly implemented, and, lastly, because it allows the public to play a greater part in environmental decision-making likely to affect their own lives.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive is intended to replace the 1990 directive. In doing so, the most important objective is to adapt the directive to developments in information technology, thus creating a second-generation directive that reflects changes in the way information is now generated in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to emphasise two aspects: the first is the issue of the deadlines within which public authorities are obliged to provide information requested. This has to be done as quickly as possible and at the latest within one month. The second issue is the fact that we have limited the scope for exceptions. Whilst it may be acceptable, in order to protect legitimate interests, for there to be arrangements exempting certain information from the disclosure requirements, it is nevertheless fundamentally important for these exceptions to be rigorously defined and strictly interpreted so as not to undermine the general principle of access so that the directive can indeed fulfil its objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to speak in support of Mrs Korhola’s report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. In particular, I shall speak from the point of view of the Committee on Petitions, and concerning the citizens’ role in the observance of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I sit on the Committee on Petitions, and I have to say that 40% of the petitions originate from citizens and non-governmental organisations ensuring compliance with Community environmental law. They would be unable to operate if they did not receive the necessary information within the set time periods. In our experience, the difficulties many petitioners encounter with regard to these petitions are twofold. Not only do they experience difficulty in understanding Community law – which is often complex and difficult to grasp – but they also have difficulty in obtaining from local, regional and national administrations sufficient information to enable them to submit their petitions to the Committee on Petitions in the approved manner. The same applies to complaints to the European Commission, as the Commissioner is well aware. It is therefore essential that this directive be adopted and transposed into the Member States’ own law as quickly as possible. One of the difficulties experienced by the earlier Directive 90/313/CEE was precisely the delay in transposing it into the Member States’ own legal systems and the unsatisfactory manner in which it was implemented during all those years.</p>
<p class="contents">This latest revision of the directive is certainly intended to bring us into line with the Aarhus Convention, whilst also taking account of the study of the outcome of the unsatisfactory implementation of Directive 90/313/CEE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Ireland, we have already incorporated the general provisions including, of course, the original Directive 90/313/EEC, in our national regulations and our freedom of information legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise a few points with which we might have difficulty. In general I agree with the provisions of Amendment No 15, relating to Article 2(2) and the definition of 'public authority'. I have no substantive problems with that amendment, but I am concerned that some parties might attempt to revert to the original proposal from the Commission on 2(2)(c), which refers to "the operation of services of general economic interest which affect or are likely to affect …". If this were to be agreed – if, in other words, we revert to the original Commission position – it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to transpose into national regulations. It would probably result in bodies which are not public authorities being brought in to have a level playing field, competitively speaking. In Ireland, for example, Telecom Éireann, which is now eircom, would be included as a former public authority. We would then have to bring in private-sector telecoms and other telecom operations. This does not fit in with the interpretation of Aarhus, so it could present problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The time limit proposed in Amendment No 16 on Article 3(2)(a) is unreasonable. As this directive applies to all documents in the environment area, in many cases the files might be in storage off-site and perhaps not computerised. The Commission proposal to deliver "as soon as possible or, at the latest, within one month" is reasonable. It is a 50% reduction on the current position and is in line with existing Irish freedom of information provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have problems with Amendment No 24. There must be discretion on the provision for charges, subject, of course, to publication and including time for searches, particularly when there are repeated requests for information. I would urge that we go down that road, leaving discretion on the publication of charges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improving the general public’s access to information on the environment leads to increased environmental awareness. The citizen must therefore be made central to environmental policy if we are successfully to be able to make the adjustments required in order to guarantee sustainable development. The importance of public participation in shaping and implementing environmental policy was emphasised as early as at the time of the Rio Declaration. Without access to information on the environment, it is difficult for people to participate and bring pressure to bear. That is why this proposal for a greater right to information on the environment is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the Member States signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters – the Aarhus Convention. This Convention is a major step forward in implementing Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and in continuing the process of transparency that began with Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment. Before the Community can ratify the Convention, the Community’s current legislation must be adjusted. That is also one of the main aims of this proposal. Another main aim is to remedy the shortcomings identified in the practical application of Directive 90/313/EEC, adopted in 1990.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important features of the Commission’s proposal for a new directive is that it would provide the <span class="italic">right</span> to information on the environment instead of <span class="italic">freedom of access</span> to information on the environment. A more detailed definition of information on the environment is also provided and a closer deadline set before which authorities have to supply information. The exceptions are also clearly defined, and it is proposed that authorities should actively supply the public with information on the environment and that they should only be able to refuse to supply such information if disclosure might adversely affect private or public interests protected by the exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the issue of public authorities was raised, I am able to say that the Commission has approved Mrs Korhola’s amendment defining ‘authorities’. This is entirely in line with the Aarhus Convention. When public services too are privatised, as is now happening in the United Kingdom, it is up to the responsible national authorities to ensure that information on the environment is still supplied to people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal covers the most important obligations under the Aarhus Convention and, in certain respects, goes further. The proposal nonetheless allows the Member States to decide how these obligations are to be put into practice. The Commission’s proposal has definitely been improved in the course of the last few months, and I should like to thank Mrs Korhola and the European Parliament for the good work that has been done. Thanks to this, I am convinced that it will be possible to adopt a common position at the Council’s meeting in June.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Parliament’s amendments are aimed at adapting the Commission’s proposal to precise wordings in the Aarhus Convention. In general, the Commission is able to approve these changes. However, we cannot approve those changes which deviate significantly from the Aarhus Convention. We think that certain amendments would lead to unduly detailed regulation of the issues included in the proposal. I want to emphasise that this is a framework directive. The main objective is to establish basic conditions for ensuring public access to information on the environment. I therefore believe that the Member States ought also to be granted a certain flexibility in transposing the directive into national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue which came up during the debate was that of how we are to deal with registers. The proposal provides for the possibility of setting up registers in the Member States, but this is not an obligation. No rules are laid down for compelling the Member States to set up registers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say a few words about public access to information on the environment held by the EU’s institutions, since this issue has also been touched upon in the debate. I am currently investigating various alternative ways of ensuring that the Community’s institutions also fulfil the obligations under the Aarhus Convention and I intend to come back to you on this matter as quickly as possible. Naturally, we must first wait until the proposal being discussed right now has been dealt with. We in the Commission cannot now approve the amendments affecting this particular issue because they fall outside the scope of this directive aimed at the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say a few words to Mr Bernié concerning the Life programme and different Life projects. I personally believe it is incredibly important that we should supply information and be completely open when it comes to the Life project. We nonetheless come up against the problem of the Member States’ saying that this is information which they themselves have produced and which they do not therefore agree to the Commission’s handing out. It is precisely this problem that is dealt with in the discussion of Article 255.

<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission is able to approve the whole of Amendment 3 and partly approve Amendments 1, 11, 15, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26 and 28.
