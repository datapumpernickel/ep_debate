We are being consulted a second time because the framework decision, on which we first expressed our opinion two years ago, has been revised. In the meantime, however, the Commission expressed a general reservation about the framework decision, to the effect that environmental protection is covered by a large number of Community acts, most of which make provisions for administrative penalties, and that the issue should therefore be dealt with by means of a first-pillar instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission insists that, given the environmental degradation in the Union, existing penalties are clearly inadequate. The proposal for a directive, which is the subject of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report, must therefore be seen as complementing the draft framework decision. According to the Commission, a first-pillar instrument must be adopted which takes precedence over a third-pillar instrument. That means that, when an area falls within the Community sphere of responsibility, it is legally impossible for the Union to adopt common rules by means of a third-pillar instrument without encroaching on the Community’s powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that Parliament agrees with the Commission on this point: in the sitting of 15 November 2001, with a procedure without debate, we adopted a recommendation on criminal penalties and Community acts, point 6 of which, to be precise, called upon the Council not to undertake any action concerning criminal law in the field of the environment before the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law had been adopted. Now then, these two documents – the framework decision and the directive – complement each other and are designed to be used together, so as to avoid inconsistency with two documents saying different things about the same subject. As you will see in the amendments, the framework decision refers precisely to the directive as regards the definitions and penalties, for we are convinced that the directive is the instrument we need, precisely because it is a Community instrument, if we are to protect the environment from destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to an additional, very important consideration: whereas the directive appears to be based on the approach of preventive protection of the environment, that is protection which takes place before the environment is completely destroyed, the framework decision proposed by the Council would, in actual fact, only impose criminal sanctions once the environment has already suffered destruction or, at any rate, irreparable damage. Here, we do not, of course, have enough time available, but in committee we have already outlined this difference of approach quite clearly. I therefore stress that we must endorse both the framework decision, which has already been approved in committee, and the directive, for, as they stand, these two documents complement each other. If, however, we were to adopt a decision which was inconclusive as regards the basic approach or, worse still, if we were to adopt Amendment No 28 to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report, which completely rejects the Commission’s proposal, we would cause the two documents to be totally inconsistent. We therefore need to agree on the complementary nature of these two instruments and adopt them both in their current forms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The topic is an exciting one. Exciting, because the judicial system which is being selected is sound, but also because it will provide much material for the European legal experts in years to come. The view that the Member States must have at their disposal the option of criminal sanctions as a way of enforcing European environmental law is unreservedly shared by the Commission, Parliament and the Council. However, we are divided about the way in which such a system of criminal sanctions for serious environmental offences must be formulated and introduced, and about the question as to who can be involved in the codecision process.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with Mr Di Lello Finuoli of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I side with the European Commission and support an Environmental Crime Directive under the first pillar. With what is known as the Danish initiative, the Council has opted for measures under the third pillar. The members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are right to reject this decision. The thing that unites the Council, Parliament and the Commission is that we all wish to act upon the very explicit request expressed at the European Council of Tampere in October 1999 for common definitions, administration of justice and penalties aimed at a limited number of sectors of special significance, but where explicit reference is made to environmental crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the choice of legal basis in the first pillar still elicits questions on the part of the Council, and on the part of some colleagues of my group, as I found out a moment ago, I will make a few enlightening observations which I hope, incidentally, will also convert the cynics. I will break these down into a few points. Why do we opt for the first pillar, and why do I recommend that the first pillar be chosen?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the Danish initiative, the Council refers to Article 31, introductory line and letter e) of the Treaty on European Union whereby the authority for common action on judicial cooperation in criminal matters is given, and whereby e) provides for progressively adopting measures establishing minimum rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the fields of organised crime, terrorism and illicit drug trafficking. This clause is included in title VI. However, in accordance with Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the provisions of this title apply “without prejudice to the powers of the European Community”. But also in Article 47, it is stated that the Treaty on European Union does not prejudice the Treaties establishing the European Communities. In other words, criminal law does not exclusively fall within the remit of the European Union. Case law of the European Court of Justice, to which, incidentally, I also make reference in the report, confirms that the Treaty on European Union cannot constitute a barrier.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the question which subsequently arises, now that there are no general barriers to arriving at criminal measures within the scope of the Treaty on European Union, is: what is the EC specifically capable of doing and what is it allowed to do? If we look at Article 280(4) of the Treaty on European Union, which corresponds to Article 5 which enshrines the subsidiarity principle, then I note that in the field of environmental criminal law too, it should be ensured that EC legislation does not prejudice the organisation of the national administration of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is therefore crucial that this directive should not be about specific provisions concerning criminal law, but that criminal law is used to make environmental policy effective. After all, the application of criminal law is in many areas an important coda for the enforcement of the rules, whereby, taking into consideration this subsidiarity, a certain level of harmonisation of criminal law enforcement can be useful for the implementation of Community provisions as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the environmental crime proposal is based on Article 175(1) of the Treaty on European Union, which stipulates that the Council, according to the codecision procedure of Article 251, affects all measures which can help the environmental objective of Article 174, provided that this process is not hindered by subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the proposal for a directive is based on environmental directives and regulations laid down on the basis of Article 175(1) and merely adds a criminal-law aspect to this legislation. The existing line is therefore extended, whereby the directive requires Member States to provide for criminal sanctions for activities which cause substantial damage to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I based my assessment of the proposal and the submission of amendments on the aforementioned criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not alter Article 1 of the directive, which aims to lay down minimum standards for punishable offences. This enables Member States themselves to determine the punishment. In the definitions of Article 2, I also included incitement as an environmental offence, for which, incidentally, I used the Danish initiative as the basis. Thirdly, I included in Article 3 punishable offences which are now mentioned in the annex, with two minor changes. I unreservedly condemn Amendment No 22, because I am of the view that there is no legal basis for it. Fourthly, I have clarified the term 'framework' in Article 4. Instead of allowing the Member States to determine the punishment, it is preferable to use the term criminal sanctions. I have adapted Amended No 25, because subsidiarity plays a role here too.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only invite the Member States to introduce measures such as confiscation if this element is specifically provided for in the Member States’ own legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive amounts to a fine balancing act. We, as the European Parliament, must be very specific, because I assume that the European Court will verify the facts, and we, along with the European Commission, will possibly head in that direction too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs, not only those from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the rapporteur of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and all shadow rapporteurs. We have worked in unity and, even if the contribution now appears very technical, it is founded on extensive policy, which is not only important to the Commission, but certainly also to the European Parliament. We are serving a worthwhile goal, namely improved environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the UN we have more than five hundred of these sorts of agreements, and there are more than a hundred directives within the framework of EU Community law. In general they are flawed in that they are not sufficiently specific and their implementation has been inexcusably ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end we need criminal sanctions and for that reason it is now important that we should lend our support to this Commission proposal for a directive. It is considerably wider in scope, more coherent and will prove more effective than the Council framework agreement, which suffers from the usual weaknesses in environmental regulation and whose legal basis is furthermore clearly flawed. The proposal for a directive, which is based on the EC Treaty and Article 175(1), is the correct instrument in this instance and, pursuant to Article 47 TEU, the Community legal instrument under the first pillar must clearly take precedence, as the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has stated in more detail in its opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also highlight a recent survey published by Eurobarometer, which confirms that the environment, together with security, health and unemployment, is one of the main issues of concern to the citizens of the European Union. We therefore have an obligation to help to find solutions that can respond to these concerns and that can guarantee the protection of the environment and of our citizens’ health, in an attempt to improve the quality of everyone’s life.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, on the one hand, an initiative presented by Denmark in 2000 with a view to adopting a Council framework decision on combating serious crimes against the environment, which proposes that Member States adopt joint measures to protect the environment under criminal law, including effective investigations and prosecutions, and effective cooperation in police, criminal and administrative matters, in other words to establish an acquis in the field of criminal sanctions against environmental crimes. On the other hand, we have a Commission initiative from 2001 with a view to producing a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law on the basis of Article 175 of the EC Treaty. This proposal is intended to apply to activities that breach Community legislation on environmental protection and/or rules adopted by Member States to complement such legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must commend the strategy pursued by both the rapporteurs, Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, of attempting to make the two reports as consistent as possible, thereby enabling the European Parliament’s position on the two initiatives to be clear and coherent. They both seek to give a clear indication of Parliament’s unequivocal preference for the Commission’s approach, in other words, for the adoption of a first-pillar instrument, because legislating on environmental matters falls within Community competence. It would be appropriate at this point, however, to point out that criminal law is not the exclusive responsibility of the European Union. By this I mean that the issue here is that the current system of sanctions is not sufficient to guarantee compliance with Community law, and this being the case, it is crucial that minimum rules are guaranteed, requiring the existence of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, with the adoption of more rigorous rules and sanctions in this field nevertheless remaining at the discretion of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This European Parliament has been calling repeatedly for this and I hope the Convention on the future of Europe itself and, therefore, the Intergovernmental Conference on reform of the Treaties, will put forward such a proposal. Only thus will it be possible to avoid future counterproductive disputes and institutional conflict, and, most importantly, will we be able to act effectively to protect the citizens of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, some of these rights – such as the right to a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment, which is enshrined in Article 37 of the Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, are not being adequately safeguarded by the Member States for lack of effective Community intervention. None of the Member States has ratified the 1998 Council of Europe Convention on the protection of the environment through criminal law. Even the many Community directives on the environment fail to provide sufficient protection because of failure to apply them and frequent failure to comply with them encouraged by the lack of effective penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for a directive requiring the Member States to introduce penalties therefore deserves our full support with the incorporation of the useful amendments advocated in the Oomen-Ruijten report. Although the Commission, Parliament and the Council Legal Service itself have, on several occasions, stressed that the protection of the environment is a fundamental Community objective pursuant to Articles 3 and 6 of the Community Treaty, that the proper legal basis for the protection of the environment through criminal law is Article 175 of the Treaty and that Community law prevails over Union law, the Council is attempting to adopt a framework decision on the same subject that does not just integrate the proposal for a directive but interferes with it, limiting its field of application and scope and making the issue no longer subject to the procedure of codecision with the European Parliament. The Di Lello Finuoli report quite rightly states that this framework decision must be consistent with the directive, must wait for it to be promulgated and must refer to it, without repeating points already covered by the directive but, where necessary, incorporating them.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will adopt both reports and I call upon all the Members to reflect on the need to avoid similar damaging disputes in the future and to achieve full communitisation of the third pillar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Liberal Group would, of course, like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello as well. These two initiatives are a practical response to one of the people’s major concerns: 88% of European citizens want the European Union to take practical measures to protect the environment. This is one of the findings of a Eurobarometer survey carried out less than a year ago and which my fellow Member Mr Coelho mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to acts of ecological delinquency, the Liberal Group supports the position defended by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, namely that the Community framework under the first pillar is the most suitable. We believe that a directive is the most appropriate tool for establishing a European list of environmental crimes and a common foundation of criminal sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the more specific content of this proposal, I believe, as most of my colleagues do, that incitement, as well as the act itself to breach European environmental legislation, must be punished. Similarly, we should use general terms when referring to breaches of the law, in order to avoid ecological crimes from being swallowed up in a potential legal loophole.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, and due to the dispute on the legal basis between Parliament and the Commission, on the one side, and the Council, on the other, I believe it is crucial that we take swift action, that we reassure our citizens by taking repressive measures against these modern-day polluters, because, today, and it seems with regard to the environment in particular, the reason why the law is toothless and benefiting unscrupulous individuals is that it is not being implemented. To take an example, most of our Member States have strengthened their criminal weaponry. This is a positive step. At the same time, it is worrying to note that in the same Member States, criminal cases involving the environment represent only 2% of the total number of all litigation. That is why we must use this dissuasive tool at Community level to ensure current regulations are applied, but also so that we are more effective in combating the organised networks which have made pollution their chosen new weapon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, it cannot possibly be used to fight the deliberate pollution of our environment effectively. One of the reasons is that the European directives are not implemented, observed or enforced. Experience has taught us that the present sanctions for infringements of European and national environmental legislation are inadequate, to put it mildly. It appears that criminal sanctions are the only instrument that can act as sufficient deterrents in order to ensure that environmental legislation is observed.</p>
<p class="contents">European environmental legislation is there for a good reason, since we are facing cross-border effects in the case of, for example, air and water pollution. In addition, the transportation of waste to locations where waste is not processed in an environmentally responsible manner has many negative implications. The internal market could also be distorted as a result. For these reasons, I am endorsing an international approach to environmental crime. I take the view that the present directive is a suitable and effective instrument in order to achieve this. This is convincingly supported in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report. The question remains whether we need a framework Council decision for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall be voting in favour of the directive, but I am tempted to vote against the draft framework decision, unless Commissioner Vitorino can convince me that the framework decision is absolutely vital for the entry into force of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No one is denying that we must improve our protection of an environment which is suffering increasing degradation and that we must use severe preventive measures. The problem, in our view, however, is the Commission’s intention to use the Community instrument – namely, the directive – based, in this case, on Article 175(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community – to do this. This Article provides for several joint actions to protect the environment, but it fully respects, in accordance with the general spirit of the Treaties, the autonomy of the Member States in the area of criminal law. The claim that the right to provide for criminal penalties is implicit in the Community responsibility for environmental protection on the grounds that it is an essential part of<span class="bold"> </span>its implementation and cannot therefore be separated from it is utterly unfounded. If criminal penalties are implicitly provided for in Article 175(1), why are they not also implicitly provided for in all the other articles of the Treaty which allow Community law to be drafted in a number of areas? We will eventually reach a situation where we are disregarding a fundamental principle of the Treaty, namely national competence in the area of criminal law. And if we disregard this principle, we will edge slightly further towards the concept of a centralised Union which is not what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that we must take no action at all – quite the opposite, in fact! The Danish Presidency presented a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law, which proposed enforcing stricter penalties whilst also respecting the freedom of the Member States to establish their legal basis on the third pillar, which is on the purely intergovernmental part of the Treaty. This option is much more suitable and this is the option, Mr President, that we should choose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Member States have indeed so far neglected to adequately back up Community regulations on environmental protection with the threat of sanctions. It was thus that the number of violations in the environmental field identified by the Commission rose from 612 in 1999 to 755 in 2000. As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to add that such cases are increasingly brought to light as a result of petitions being submitted. It is our EU's citizens themselves who have developed a feel for environmental concerns and who increasingly report such offences<span class="italic"> </span>or who turn to us in search of help for frequent lack of protection on the part of their Member State. It would, then, be great if governments could demonstrate something like the same degree of environmental awareness as do their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, the Commission took Member States to the European Court of Justice in connection with 39 cases, and so it is time for us to respond on an EU-wide basis. In doing so, it is not our intention to annul national criminal law – the directive applies only to activities in defence of Community environment law and the regulations by means of which the Member States have hitherto transposed it. We are laying down only minimum requirements for the protection of the environment through criminal law, so that the retention or creation of stricter safeguards is left to the Member States. What this directive combats above all is environmental pollution that is attributable to private individuals or corporate bodies, in which respect inducement must incur a penalty in the same way as active behaviour and failure to act where there is a legal duty to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental offences still appear to be regarded as excusable peccadilloes in some Member States. That must come to an end. The directive, like the framework decision, is necessary, appropriate, and proportionate to that purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know, however, that a number of these texts are ‘dead letters’ due to a lack of effective penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">The general public believes that, most of the time, the use of the polluter pays principle to impose financial or material sanctions is insufficient and it is all too aware that these penalties are a poor deterrent given the enormous profits which can be made from the activities that cause the greatest amount of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that some environmental damage is completely irreversible and cannot be made good. These considerations therefore justify the adoption by the Member States of provisions to penalise non-observance of European environmental requirements through criminal law. That is why – together with my fellow European Socialists – I am fully supporting the Commission’s initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not underestimate the main difficulty that we must face here, in other words, the problem of the legal basis. For my part, I support the point of view that this matter falls squarely within the Union’s areas of competence under the first pillar and therefore requires the adoption of a framework directive endorsed by the House.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the meaning of the recommendation adopted by Parliament in November 2001. It is worth reminding the Council that, had it finalised its draft framework decision under the third pillar, this would have certainly have been against the political will of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – and because we are committed to strengthening environmental legislation by applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions – we must adopt a sound text, which is above all legal argument and which is unlikely to be condemned by the Court of Justice. This means that we must pay particular attention to the subsidiarity principle and the rules on competence that are laid down by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Community has the power to require the Member States to adopt criminal sanctions if substantial Community standards are breached, it does not, however, have the power to define the types and levels of sanctions to be applied. That is why we must show particular care when referring to concepts such as extradition, which specify how serious the offences and sentences are. I am, however, reassured by the wording which was adopted more recently by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the Community has no competence to adopt provisions whose efect is to approximate national criminal provisions. Therefore, to mention the concept of incitement – which does not exist in all the Member States’ legislation – is to seek to bring the national provisions closer together, which, in my view, considerably weakens the legal validity of this text.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from these comments, I would like to reiterate my full support for the adoption of this text and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten. We believe that this text sends out a strong political signal in respect of a crime that our fellow citizens regard in an increasingly poor light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst it is true that terrorism may have an environmental impact, for example the release of pathogens or the deliberate poisoning of water, this report goes much further than terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Berthu that we must resist attempts to extend the EU's sphere of influence into the judicial area, environmental or otherwise. I am particularly worried about the amendments which talk about extradition or about the surrender or confiscation of profits as first pillar powers. The advice of Parliament's legal services is that there is no legal base under Article 175 for this measure. Why do we pay these lawyers to give us advice and then ignore it?</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to see Member States cooperating to adopt measures under the third pillar to combat environmental crime, for example in common definitions of criminal offences; but the British Conservatives will vote for rejection of this report as amended because it has no legal base. It talks a lot about subsidiarity in the recitals, but the articles themselves fly in the face of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union would be better advised to divert its energies to an area where it does have legal powers to bring errant Member States before the European Court of Justice for non-compliance with existing directives, as Mr von Boetticher suggested earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of us fear that this proposal opens the door too wide, paving the way for uniform European law on the environment and perhaps eventually even for a European environmental agency with powers comparable to those of the FBI. Such concerns are groundless. None of these things is envisaged. The right tool has been chosen – a directive to be transposed by the Member States – and an array of amendments ensures that it does not trespass upon the core area of the competence of the State and of the civil and criminal courts. These are virtually the words used by Amendment No 30, which makes explicit reference to extradition, for example, being envisaged only where there is provision for it in the Member State's own legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">By this modus operandi, we are using the right instruments in pursuit of an important Community objective. The proposals made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy should therefore be approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli for their excellent work on two texts that cover the same subject: the proposal for a directive and a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law. Both reports contribute significantly to an important European-Union-level debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere in 1999 agreed in that common definitions, common incriminations and common sanctions should be established in a limited number of sectors of particular importance, and among those sectors it highlighted the environmental crime issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will recall – and several Members referred to it – in 2000, Denmark presented an initiative for a framework decision on combating serious environmental crime. This framework decision is based on the rules of the Treaty on European Union and therefore belongs to the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001 the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the same subject, which is based on Article 175 of the European Community Treaty. Both proposals pursue the same objective. They seek to improve the implementation of Community environmental law and have the same starting point: we all recognise that there is a lack of effectiveness in the protection of the environment in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has taken a more ambitious approach by proposing a directive. The Commission has pursued this line for a number of reasons. The Community has, within given competence parameters, the power to regulate behaviours in order to achieve a Community objective. The Commission has never contested that, as regards concrete criminal sanctions, the Community cannot purport to act in the criminal area in isolation. However, to the extent that this is necessary for the achievement of Community objectives, the Commission is convinced that the Community can oblige Member States to provide for criminal sanctions where criminal law guarantees that Community law is enforced effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the sanctions currently established by Member States are not enough and that they do not guarantee full compliance with European Union law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not seeking an interinstitutional conflict. The key aim of our proposal is to create an additional guarantee of impartiality and to give authorities greater scope for cross-border investigations of environmental crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland, this is the reason why it is necessary to have a framework decision together with the directive. We can provide for the provision of criminal sanctions in the directive, but the concrete scope of those criminal sanctions must be included in the framework decision. The framework decision has the leverage to allow the judicial authorities of the Member States to pursue cross-border investigations on environmental crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether measures concerning criminal law should be based on the rules of the European Union Treaty or of the European Community Treaty, is not just an interesting legal question for European lawyers, it is of fundamental institutional importance, in particular as regards the role and powers of the European Parliament, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice and the legal effects of European legislation in this area. I can fully subscribe to the arguments that have been put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten. I would like to inform you that the Commission has never called into question the fact that matters of judicial cooperation belong to the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft framework decision is therefore to be seen as a complementary text to the directive. All the amendments tabled seek to transform the draft framework decision into a complementary instrument to the Commission proposal for a directive. All the fundamental aspects of the issue are covered by the Commission proposal for a directive. The Council framework decision will deal with three relevant matters: liability of legal persons, jurisdictional competence and issues concerning extradition and prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">We respect subsidiarity because the framework decision put forward by Denmark very closely follows the Council of Europe Convention concerning environmental crime. To date, nobody has accused the Council of Europe Convention of being against the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli follow exactly this same line.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I therefore welcome the opinion on the draft framework decision by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific amendments to the proposal for a directive are concerned, I am glad to inform you that the Commission can accept all the amendments suggested with the following exceptions: Amendments Nos 8 and 9, 10, 11 and 13, 19, 20 and 27, 21, 24, 25, 28 and 29. Overall, I am very grateful for Parliament's significant contribution to improving both texts on which the House is going to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank again the rapporteurs, as well as Mr Wuori, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for their valuable input and support, especially as they all had to work within very tight time limits on a very complex matter. I hope that the reports will receive across-the-board support tomorrow from this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
