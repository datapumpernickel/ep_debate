Nevertheless, it is an honour for me to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I give detailed reasons for this question, I should like to say a few words about the background. The history of this issue, namely that of liberal professions, in particular legal professions – to whom this question relates – goes back several years. Parliament dealt with this issue in the previous parliamentary term on the basis of two questions for oral answer in the corresponding resolutions, particularly in the light of the activities of the Internal Market and Services Directorate General under Mario Monti, the former Commissioner for competition, and also in view of the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies that sparked off this whole debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to conceal the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs actually always held a broad conviction – even across the political spectrum – that this Vienna study took a very biased approach, one biased towards economic aspects, and did not take sufficient account of the specific role of the liberal professions, particularly the legal professions, in administering justice. The Committee also feared – and this was borne out to some extent by the documents – that the Commission had not always drawn the correct conclusions from the documents of the Vienna study and, furthermore, was consciously conducting a policy that we doubted was the right course in the case of some particular issues. After all, liberal professions, with their particular importance, quite simply cannot be compared with the supermarket round the corner in terms of competition policy and competition law. Their origins are different, their importance to the functioning of society is different.</p>
<p class="contents">Presenting another question for oral answer today, following the latest Commission interim report presented by Commissioner Kroes – an accompanying resolution will follow in the coming week – practically continues the tradition from the previous parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it crystal clear at this juncture that we, too, are of course well aware that antiquated customs should be dispensed with. We are no longer living in the Middle Ages, and the guild system is a thing of the past. Nonetheless, particular account must of course be taken of the distinguishing features of the liberal professions: in particular the legal professions, which are what interests the Committee on Legal Affairs. These features form part of the judicial system, and have to function. If the system does not function, the public suffers, being afforded insufficient legal protection, and this means that an intrinsic part of democracy, namely the rule of law, is also called into question. That is why the rules for the liberal professions have to be scrutinised very carefully and in great detail, and why we have to consider carefully what is needed in order to afford legal protection and access to justice for all citizens that is as effective and safe as possible, including in practice. Naturally, this should be done with particular regard to the case law of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to a specific problem which has, of course, also been addressed in conjunction with this question, and which was one of the reasons that the Committee on Legal Affairs wanted a further debate on this issue today in plenary. That problem is the specific role of tariffs in the liberal legal professions, since, in many EU Member States, these have a special nature and importance, especially in connection with the rules for reimbursement of legal expenses, and also in situations in which companies providing legal-expenses insurance wish to make reimbursements themselves on behalf of their clients. Such things are virtually impossible without tariffs, and are also deeply rooted in the legal traditions of many Member States. As such, they should not be called into question without good cause, because they also represent a fundamental aspect of consumer protection. This should be made quite clear at this juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">The case law of the European Court of Justice has taken great care when dealing with such issues in the past. Just recently – a few weeks ago – we saw a specific instance in which the Advocate General, too, attempted to show due care in such issues. It is very important to us that the Commission cease dealing with this fundamental issue – which is extremely important to the functioning of the legal professions in many Member States – in this way, as the Commission’s documents would suggest. The Commission cannot treat the liberal professions in the same way as it does supermarkets. These professions have a special importance and role.</p>
<p class="contents">Some EU Member States have now abolished tariffs and, interestingly, this has meant an increase in prices for lawyers and consumers, for example – in some cases they are considerably higher, on average, than those in Member States who still have such a system. Particularly with regard to the price trend, this system has ensured that legal protection for consumers continues to be accessible and financially sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">We would now welcome a reply to our oral question from Commissioner Kroes, who has already had the opportunity to discuss this issue with us in committee, on behalf of the Commission. We shall then have the opportunity to respond to it, both in the context of the debate and, in the coming week, in the context of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He presented his views quite clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises the special role of the legal sector in the good administration of justice and in promoting access to justice – by the way, in response to the example cited by Mr Lehne, the Commission also recognises that supermarkets are very important and very honourable members of our community – we are certainly not challenging this. But we are saying that we need to look afresh at the current regulation of the sector to see what can be modernised to promote new types of services and new ways of doing things. That is in the interests of the users of these key services.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are proposing that Member States use a proportionality test to see how far current regulations are all really serving the public interest. This approach fully respects the subsidiarity principle. It allows for national circumstances, and the special characteristics of the legal sector, to be taken fully into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission certainly agrees with the need for some regulation. I repeat: our initiative is about better regulation, not deregulation. We also recognise that it is the Member States’ right to determine the balance between state rules and self-regulation by professional bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the right of Member States to fix tariffs, I would underline the position of the Commission in its report of February 2004. In our view the <span class="italic">Arduino</span> judgment suggests that state measures delegating regulatory powers to professional bodies in order to fix tariffs can be challenged under the competition rules – for example, Articles 3(1)(g), 10(2) and 81 EC – if the state does not have the final word and exercise effective control of the implementation of these tariffs. We are expecting further clarification on this when the Court delivers its preliminary ruling in the <span class="italic">Macrino</span> case (case C-202/04).</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are the internal market rules. These are at issue in another case pending before the European Court of Justice, the <span class="italic">Cipolla</span> case (case C-04/04), again concerning the Member States’ responsibility for price fixing. The Commission considers that minimum prices for lawyers’ services are a restriction on the freedom to provide services because they neutralise the competitive advantage of service providers from other Member States. Moreover, we see no justification for minimum prices under the proportionality test, since they do not per se guarantee quality, access to justice, or good ethical conduct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission must not deal with these cases as if they were a question of a mere business relationship between client and service provider. The relationship between a solicitor or notary and their client affects the administration of justice, a sensitive issue in terms of democracy, as Mr Lehne has also pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the professional associations of legal professions in the different countries is very beneficial to relations, not just corporate relations, but also those in defence of the public interest. The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which Mrs Kroes is so keen to see, has so far recognised that systems such as the Spanish system conform to European legislation, whose fee rates are merely guidelines, rather than minimums, which help the judicial administration to set costs, which is ultimately always controlled judicially.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should the opposition of many lawyers from many countries to the <span class="italic">quota litis</span> pact be questioned. This pact violates the dignity of work and shows a lack of consideration and respect for the profession. The prohibition of the <span class="italic">quota litis</span> pact has also been accepted by the national courts, Mrs Kroes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call upon the European Commission to respect the work of institutions which, like the colleges of lawyers and notaries, have generally speaking been working well for more than two centuries, despite the ups and downs and interruptions of history. Do not forget that constitutions, such as the Spanish Constitution, recognise the essential role of professional associations and the fundamental work they do.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission should be loyal to the European tradition, and not to the newer United States tradition. We must support small legal practices. Do not make any mistakes.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diana Wallis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, as will be clear, most of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs are very passionate about the legal profession. For many of us, myself included, it was our profession before we came here and, in that sense, we have an interest. Yet however passionate I might have been about my former profession and its independence, I am more passionate about access to justice and legal services in general and how we make those services available to serve the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The public interest in access to justice must, I believe, be our overriding goal and not the protection or convenience of lawyers who may find it more comfortable to continue to provide services in the way they have always done. The profession needs to be independent, but its protectionism should only serve the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that, in Europe, we have a wonderful opportunity to look around and see what exactly best serves the public interest. For example, I have always thought that the fee scales in Germany at the lower end work well to ensure that claimants with low value problems can pursue justice. In my own country, this is often a problem because the costs are so high and, where we have some form of fixed fee, the fees are so low that lawyers decline the work. These are delicate balances, but Europe gives us the chance to look at many answers that may be available to these problems and to pick the best for the society we try to serve, and we should not be frightened or protective about looking for the best. I believe that so long as the Commission shares that aim, we should be able to work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us look for the best and do it together. That is the only way we can face all the clients and potential clients of those professionals that we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to re-emphasise some key messages about our aspirations in this area. Our initiative is about better regulation. What does that mean? It means a regulation that is balanced and no more restrictive than is strictly necessary. We want to promote, not hinder, access to justice. That is what really makes sense. Opening the way to greater competition in that sector will do just that; it will result in the emergence of new and innovative types of services. That is surely a great advantage. It will benefit all by releasing the potential of the sector in terms of growth, in terms of jobs, as well as providing better-quality services and more choice for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a more detailed comment on the crucial question of price fixing, which has been put on the table as the main issue this evening. Generally, I do not see how wide-scale price fixing, even for in-court work, can be objectively justified for all consumers and business users. There may be certain limited circumstances in which price regulation is justified: for example, where there is a need to provide special protection for certain disadvantaged groups, including the lower paid. That may require very limited and carefully targeted price regulation. More generally though, consumers and business users are likely to be better off with a number of offers from different service providers to compare and to choose from.</p>
<p class="contents">In systems where legal costs are borne by the defeated party, I can, however, see some merit in having a guide for judges when they need to decide on costs. I am not saying that removing price regulation or that lower levels of regulation will automatically lead to lower prices, more choice for consumers or the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the removal of price regulation in the UK leading to high legal costs, I am not aware of any evidence to show that price deregulation in the UK has meant problems for UK citizens in accessing legal advice and representation, or that UK legal fees have escalated disproportionately as a result. In fact the Law Society in the UK noted in 1999 that introducing greater competition into the area of conveyancing of property transfer led to price falls of up to 24% in the 1990s and opened the way for consumers to shop around to get the best deal. In the country I know best, research in 2002 found that the introduction of competition in conveyancing resulted in fees falling.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on quality. We all want European consumers to have access to quality legal services. That is essential if access to justice for all is to be a reality. But I do not think fixed prices are always essential for this. I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that removing fixed tariffs has led to a deterioration in the quality of legal services in Member States where this has happened, though quality has a price. A fixed price does not in itself guarantee quality. The motto I will take over from Mrs Wallis is: ‘let us look for the best and do it together’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
