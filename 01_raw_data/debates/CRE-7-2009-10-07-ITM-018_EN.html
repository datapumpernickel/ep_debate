<p class="contents">A project has been tabled before us which may assume the same strategic importance as Nabucco. I am talking about the pan-European Constanţa – Trieste oil pipeline. This pipeline will transport the oil resources in the Caspian Sea via the Georgian terminal at Supsa, continuing along a pipeline via the port of Constanţa right to Trieste.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only guarantee energy security for our states and citizens through the diversification of the supply sources and routes for oil and gas. With this in mind, Romania has embarked on developing a port terminal in Constanţa, capable of receiving liquefied natural gas which it will then distribute to other consumers in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This vote will mean that, particularly in a committee like that on agriculture, as well as in this Parliament, in plenary, we will have codecision. Parliament will therefore be on an equal footing with the Council which, in democratic terms, obviously represents huge progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this opportunity to point out that, since an overwhelming majority of our Irish friends said ‘yes’ today to the constitutional treaty and the Polish President – according to what the President of our Parliament said just now – is also about to sign the treaty, all that is needed is a ‘yes’ from the Czech President. I would therefore like all our fellow Members from different political groups to be able, within the context of our respective competences, to try to convey to their Czech counterparts the message that this treaty really must be signed, all the more so since the Czech Parliament has already said ‘yes’. All that is left for the President to do is to sign this parchment and thus take the democratic way forward in his country, so as to advance our democracy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy. It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it. Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified. More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs. There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a painful paradox here, in that Poles in Lithuania, who in some regions constitute the majority of citizens, were in a better situation before the accession of Lithuania to the European Union than now, when Lithuania is a member of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The self-government of the Salcininkai region has been given until 14 October to remove Polish street name signs, which is against European standards and the European Charter of Local Self-Government. In March 2008, freedom of activity of the Polish school system was restricted, on the strength of Lithuanian law. In the space of one and a half years, four schools, with a total of 45 classes, were closed, and a further 107 classes are threatened with closure. Changes are being forced on Polish surnames, so that they look like Lithuanian ones. Finally, many Poles have still not been returned property which was seized by the communists, by the Soviet Union, after 1939 or after 1944.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the European Parliament to defend Poles in Lithuania, in accordance with European standards of human rights and the rights of minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these declarations are contradicted by reality on a daily basis. The situation in northern Portugal is an illustration of this. In the District of Braga alone, at least 10 companies have closed in recent weeks, leaving more than 300 workers unemployed. Many others are at risk of closing.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is particularly serious in the textile and clothing sector: one of the sectors of the European Union to be worst affected by the increasing liberalisation of world trade. In this tragic situation, there is an urgent need for solutions that are different from the political guidelines that caused it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to implement safeguard measures, in particular, in sectors to be indicated by the Member States, in order to be able to sustain and promote jobs and the continued operation of these companies, as well as to move forward with the creation – an issue that has already been the subject of a resolution by this Parliament – of a Community programme to support the textile sector, with adequate resources specifically targeted at the least favoured regions that are dependent on this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee.</p>

Since 2005, this body has brought together more than 100 000 members from 16 European member organisations of train drivers and has sought to be recognised as a fully-fledged social partner in the section of social dialogue dealing with railways. Despite lengthy negotiations with the European Transport Workers’ Federation, which is currently the sole representative of employee interests on this committee, it has not yet been possible to find a compromise that would give ALE the possibility of directly defending its members’ interests. In my opinion, this is a very unfortunate state of affairs. Social dialogue, as approved by the European Parliament, should, in my view, allow pluralism. I firmly believe that no organisation, not even one that represents 80% of employees in the European rail sector, has the right to a monopoly and I therefore call on all parties, including the European Commission, to clear the way for further negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even more than that, it is their future that is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for a new form of regulation is today supported by a large majority of the Member States, the dairy G20, as we will call it from now on. I think that, now more than ever, the time has come to take decisions, and certainly at the next Council – a formal one this time – of the Ministers for Agriculture, which will take place on 19 October in Luxembourg. This is extremely urgent. A crisis of this magnitude must not become the subject of a commission study, as happened two days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, I have two questions for President Buzek, which I trust you will pass on to him. I understand that this morning he met Cecilia Malmström, the Swedish Minister for European Affairs, and I would like to know if she was able to confirm to him the Presidency’s commitment to find an urgent solution to this crisis, along the lines of the resolution that we voted for in Strasbourg at the last part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to this high-level group, this think tank that was launched the day before yesterday. Before and as from the next entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we know our Parliament will become a joint decision maker, a colegislator. I think that it would make sense for us to be included in the work of this high-level group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few days ago, the term for detaining Mr Ivanilovas was extended, as in two months, the regime’s authorities were unable to find any proof of his guilt. It is also important to point out that from childhood, Mr Ivanilovas has suffered from bronchial asthma. To his parents’ knowledge, he is held in a cell where there are 26 prisoners, but only 6 beds and people smoke in the cell constantly. Marijus has asthma attacks, but he is not allowed to receive his medicine, nor is he allowed to meet loved ones or even the Lithuanian consul. Mr President, this is happening in a country in our neighbourhood. This is how the citizen of an EU Member State − Lithuania − is being treated! I call on you to take measures within your powers to ensure the immediate release of Marijus Ivanilovas, as there is no proof of his guilt and the charge is unfounded. Mr Ivanilovas must be allowed to return to Lithuania. He needs immediate medical attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conformity of the amended law to international standards has been confirmed by the European authorities in the area of minorities – OSCE High Commissioner Knut Vollebæk and EU Commissioner Leonard Orban.

This is no coincidence. This law limits the extent to which minorities can use their own language, contrary to the various statements made, although it is true that minority languages can also be used in a very small area of public life. However, it is not true that we are avoiding debate on this matter because, if someone tries to agree in five minutes on this subject in front of 10 journalists, they will probably fail. I would like to draw attention to the fact that as this law has been poorly drafted in bad faith, it is creating fresh legal uncertainty because in two days, the Slovak Ministry of Culture has provided three different explanations for some of the articles in the law.</p>
<p class="contents">It has instilled fear in people. We are already aware of several instances where employers are ordering their employees to speak Slovak. I deeply regret the need to raise this matter in this chamber.

I would like to give you a positive example in this area. Serbia has adopted a law on cultural autonomy which is unique throughout the whole of Europe, and which is positive not only for the whole of the European Union, but for the whole of Europe too.</p>
<p class="contents">According to this law, 13 minorities, including Slovaks, Romanians, Hungarians and other peoples, can directly elect their own national councils. These national councils are financed out of the budget and can, under this cultural autonomy, handle and control the relevant institutions. The other lesson to be learnt is that the minorities were involved in drafting this law. Therefore, Serbia can set an example for many EU countries, such as France, Slovakia and others, in terms of how to guarantee the rights of minorities in law. This has also helped Serbia take a major step on the road to European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This money was promised by the Commission President under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in a recent visit to Limerick.

<p class="contents">Last year, the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism organised a delegation to the Danube region to find out about and promote the potential offered by this river as part of EU policies. One of the main conclusions reached by this delegation was to create in the European Parliament an intergroup to promote the River Danube. The creation of this intergroup helps the European Parliament reaffirm its commitment to be involved in and actively support both the drafting of a strategy for the Danube region and its implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the sector’s challenges is to improve the range of tourism experiences on offer for the whole world without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out by the Montreal Declaration, access to tourist leisure for the whole world necessarily means being involved in the struggle against inequality and the exclusion of the culturally different, those of limited means or abilities, or those who live in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has translated this ambition into a pilot project on social tourism which the Commission will develop this year. Another reason for its actions is that social tourism helps the employment rate by combating seasonality – one of the sector’s major problems – and creates greater equality, more jobs and jobs which last for longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that is our objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two years after its accession to the European Union, Romania is one of the countries with the lowest success rates in terms of accessing European funds. The procedure for accessing European money is fairly complicated and impenetrable. The Structural and Cohesion Funds provide financial leverage which may facilitate economic recovery, particularly during the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I feel that we need simple rules for accessing the Structural Funds so that European money can reach beneficiaries as quickly as possible. Particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to Community funds and discourage people from obtaining EU financial support.</p>
