<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berger (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">.</span></span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do. I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today. It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis. </p>
<p class="contents">The current state of play – and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again – is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst. These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits. However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue. Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice’s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services. There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here. Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises. It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement. All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services. I, together with the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council’s Legal Service, is inappropriate. Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council’s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that Parliament’s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission’s proposal. Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense. When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals. I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a “service provision card plus notification for each individual contract” system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract. This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms. However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission’s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.</p>
<p class="contents">An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter. This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident. </p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure. What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States. I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs. I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting. However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment. I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee’s amendments, which they adopted unanimously. I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions. I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament’s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them. Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report. I withdraw the two other amendments – that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons. I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote. This would make our rapporteur’s life considerably easier in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio’s reports. Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions. On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce. I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur. That is why he deserves special mention! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate. </p>
<p class="contents">May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate. I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge. I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards. If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card. However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice. An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market. </p>
<p class="contents">It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards. Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too. That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired. Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided. That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio’s Amendment No 22 in both respects. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments. I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I propose to confine my comments to two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense. There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account. My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment. Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario. If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card. If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive. I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither outcome would be satisfactory. Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well. We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest – that of public order<span class="italic"> –</span> and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution. We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be. Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark. Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance. In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting. Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to achieve a completely flexible solution. If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter. Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers. We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC. We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law. However, before the elections we – the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is – worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens. We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU. They have now got to grips with “EU”. We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver “EC service provision card” and not “EU service provision card”. It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes. I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism. This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that. It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed. That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment. Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security. The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity. You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.<span class="bold"> </span>If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date. Legal security requires this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card. There are already some <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls laid down in article 4 of the directive. It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting <span class="italic">ex ante </span>the entry of that worker into its territory. It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security. The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom. Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls. Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.</p>

These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services. The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card – and I am with Mr Wieland on this – are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts. Why do I think we need the directive so much? Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market. Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations? How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided. </p>
<p class="contents">There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory. I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low. So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card. It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration’s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended. </p>
<p class="contents">I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner. Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?

In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22. Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now. We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card’s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States. In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned. In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned. The other amendments are unacceptable. Personally, I am rather in favour of the term “EU service provision card” which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this. </p>
<p class="contents">As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary. Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued. Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10. The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal. I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term “self-employed” is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged. </p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood’s remark. He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders. This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country. The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries. The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way. In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate. On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point. I will keep myself free in this connection. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
