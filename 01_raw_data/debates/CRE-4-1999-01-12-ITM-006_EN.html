<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elchlepp </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of my report is the transposition of EU competition law by the Republic of Lithuania under Article 64 of the 1995 Europe Agreement between the EU and Lithuania. I would recommend that the European Parliament approve the Community"s position on this in the EU‐Lithuania Association Council. The subject we are concerned with here may appear rather technical, but in the context of pre‐accession relations with Lithuania it is of extreme political importance. After all, competition policy is an important instrument for ensuring free trade and for turning the Lithuanian economy into a viable social market economy that can hold its own in the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the introduction of the complex EU competition rules represents an enormous challenge for all applicant countries. After all, in the transition to a market economy, they must first develop their own national competition law. I would urge the Commission to take greater account of that when it evaluates the extent to which these countries have adjusted. So we will still need to show some flexibility in the coming years in regard to the implementation of EU competition rules. Setting conditions that are too rigid is more likely to prove counter‐productive. In particular, we must always look at the social implications of adjustment if we want to ensure that the citizens of the applicant state give their broad support to democracy and the social market economy. That is very important to the stability of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Lithuanian economic sectors will not be able to do without state aid for some time at least, in the course of adjusting to the EU <span class="italic">acquis</span> in competition law. In view of the aggressive market strategies of western competitors, we should not judge individual defence mechanisms and supports in certain sectors too harshly. But, all in all, Lithuania has made substantial progress in approximating its laws to EU legislation and is endeavouring to establish the requisite implementing structures. The Lithuanian Government submitted new draft competition legislation in 1998. The Lithuanian Parliament passed much of it last December.</p>
<p class="contents">The competition rules for undertakings are generally consistent with Community law and in 1997 the Lithuanian Government also submitted a decision on monitoring state aid. Meanwhile Lithuania has endeavoured to facilitate free trade with the EU, for instance by ambitious tariff reductions. That is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusions are as follows: we should not pursue too rigorous a policy of approximation to Western competition rules, for it could be damaging to the long‐term process of transformation to ask too much. Secondly, Lithuania evidently needs greater support for the training and further training of the officials of its State Competition and Consumer Protection Office. Furthermore, a targeted information policy must be pursued to promote acceptance in the private economic sector of the new competition rules and economic liberalisation and restructuring measures. Account must also be taken of social and environmental aspects during the adjustment process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with two points. Since the Lithuanian economy, like for that matter all the Central and Eastern European economies, is undercapitalised, the EU should consider providing direct capital aid for setting up and modernising undertakings, over and above the existing structural aid measures, where appropriate through the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is certainly regrettable that Lithuania is not at present among the first wave of applicants. While appreciating all the obstacles that still remain, I believe that the accession negotiations between the EU and Lithuania should begin before the scheduled date, which is not until the end of 1999, if possible even during the German Presidency of the Council, for that is the only way to sustain the optimism and willingness to adjust that have developed in that country.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Seppänen </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Mr President, in July 1997 the Commission was in favour of accession negotiations with Latvia beginning as soon as that country had made sufficient headway in fulfilling the pre‐conditions laid down by the European Council at Copenhagen. It was the Commission"s opinion that not one applicant country at that time had entirely fulfilled all these pre‐conditions. Despite this, the countries involved were put in a certain order to have their applications dealt with, so that, for example, Latvia had to wait longer than Estonia. There is no justification for that, at least as far as the enforcement of the regulations governing competition are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU strives to ensure that there is a high level internal market that renounces the notion of restrictions on competition. We cannot take for granted that countries that have attained membership will thrive in such a market. According to an assessment by the Commission, Latvia at present would have difficulty in coping with the pressures of competition in the single market, and EU integration will mean immense economic structural change for it. Latvia has a new law on competition which is largely in line with EU regulations. Some amendments to it are still needed, as certain subsidies are tied to exports and it sanctions certain special and sole rights which do not comply with Community regulations. The EU is shaping the harmonisation of legislation by making demands on Latvian society to its own satisfaction, and Latvia has no alternative but to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of quality problems Latvia"s manufactured products find it difficult to enter the EU"s western markets. The country"s economic competitiveness is based solely on low wages, and this is where the problem lies. In order for Latvia to be competitive, its levels of pay have to remain low. If Latvia has low rates of pay it would, as an EU member, be a country of cheap production, and a sort of flag‐of‐convenience state in the EU. When the restrictions on goods between the EU countries and Latvia are lifted, a free labour market will come into existence. Because of differences in pay and living standards, it will be worth Latvians leaving the country to work in the older EU countries, where rates of pay are higher. For Latvia that would mean a trained workforce leaving the country, and for the EU it would mean a problem of cheap labour. This will be a widespread problem with a rapid enlargement programme, and it will affect not just Latvia but all the applicant countries. The countries in front of Latvia in the queue will cause exactly the same problem for the EU. The economic structure in all the applicant countries is entirely different from that in the EU single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would still remind everyone of the Commission"s assessment that Latvia fulfils the democracy pre‐conditions relating to stable institutions, the rule of law, human rights and the protection of minority groups, but measures need to be introduced to speed up the granting of citizenship to people other than those who already have Latvian citizenship. These are serious problems, and they are serious in Estonia too. I can see no justification for Latvia having inferior status in comparison with some other applicant countries when it comes to EU membership. The country is ready to pay a high price for EU membership by preparing its economy for EU market forces and competition.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, Estonia occupies a rather special place amongst the three Baltic States. There is already a direct EU‐Estonia free‐trade area, which is not the case for Latvia and Lithuania where we are seeing an asymmetric and phased establishment of a free‐trade area. In another respect too, Estonia occupies a rather special place. It is the only Baltic country to have been included in the first round of accession negotiations. This certainly does not mean to say that Latvia and Lithuania are performing any worse in economic and political terms. Indeed recently these countries seem to have embarked on a race to catch up. But the starting position of Latvia and Lithuania was different to that of Estonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The free‐trade area is only of any economic benefit if the legal framework is based on uniform principles. This also applies to competition policy. The Europe Agreement with Estonia states that competition legislation must be completed no later than the end of 1997. This date is now long past. The Committee on External Economic Relations is therefore hurrying to approve the Commission"s proposal. It is important in the context of Estonia"s future accession, on which negotiations began last year, that applicant countries should be able to cope with the market mechanisms as they apply in the Union. This is why Estonian companies must become more competitive. The present proposal is to adjust the rules for the implementation of the Community"s competition policy for Estonia. This relates to Articles 85, 86 and 96 of the EC Treaty which concern, respectively, the prohibition of restrictive practices, the prohibition of the abuse of dominant positions and discipline as regards state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal purpose in drawing up the implementing regulations for those articles is to improve trade between the European Union and Estonia. Yet both parties reserve the right to apply anti‐dumping and protection measures on the basis of the association agreement. The reason these measures still apply is that there are still great differences in the provisions regarding state aid on the two sides. These measures must also be brought into line by the end of 1999. In the meantime it is not of course the Commission"s intention to refuse entry to the European market for Estonian products under the guise of anti‐dumping legislation. This would not help the competitiveness of Estonian companies and could therefore be an obstacle to the European Union"s rapid enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent report on Estonian state aid we read that the Estonian competition act, applicable from October 1998, provides better conditions for monitoring state aid and collecting related data. State aid is essential during the transition to a modern market economy, but it must be organised in a way which makes it possible to assess to what extent Estonian companies have sufficient competitive strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as rapporteur I thank the Committee on External Economic Relations for its effective cooperation and I would like to present my conclusions. I have made it clear that competition legislation in Estonia needs to be implemented properly, especially as Estonia can expect to be among the first to enter negotiations. This does not mean that I want to create an extra accession criterion. The direct criteria for accession are clearly stated in the Europe Agreements. Estonia has made huge efforts over recent years to prepare for accession to the European Union. I am not just referring here to the economic growth it has achieved and its undertaking, in signing the IMF"s economic memorandum, to strive for economic growth without overheating. In political terms too Estonia has made the necessary effort to satisfy the entry criteria. Although major steps must still be taken, such as in reforming the judiciary, before we can really talk about a truly democratic political culture, there have been a great many positive political developments. One such example is the cooperation between the government and opposition and the efforts to promote the integration of Estonia"s Russian minority.</p>
<p class="contents">These efforts by the Estonian Government must encourage us to speed up the process leading to Estonia"s accession to the European Union. When we call for reforms, we must also be prepared to provide the correct response to these reforms.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schwaiger </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of Romania too the Committee on External Economic Relations is pleased to note that the necessary approximation of Romanian competition provisions to EU rules and the cooperation between competition authorities can develop satisfactorily. As you know from the other reports, this relates to the implementation of the basic principles of competition policy, the responsible authorities, the consultation procedure in cross‐border cases and administrative cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, the Commission"s position on Romania"s application for accession shows that, on the whole, Romania"s competition rules are compatible with the EU rules. So from the point of view of the Committee on External Economic Relations I can therefore propose that we approve the Council"s common position in the case of Romania too. One particularly positive aspect is that, as in other areas, the Romanian administration is cooperating very closely with EU authorities in regard to the competition provisions and is taking the corresponding legislative steps. However, these should include modernisation of the public administration, where there is still some room for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of the Romanian administration is simplified by the fact that Romanian executive officials have already received intensive training under the PHARE programme. But I would like also to look today at the efforts made by Romania and the need for Romania to come closer to the European Union economically and to gradually adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . The majority of economic reforms still remain to be undertaken by the Romanian Government. It must focus on the further and long‐delayed privatisation of large state enterprises and on improving the framework conditions for founding small and medium‐sized enterprises. To date, only some 20 % of firms have gone into private ownership.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the only way the competition rules, which will then become rules common to Romania and to the European Union, have a chance to really apply and to function. The events of the last few days show that the Romanian Government is making serious efforts to make up the deficit in regard to public enterprises and to close down the least profitable banks and telecommunications companies. At the same time, it must give greater support than before to the establishment of small and medium‐sized enterprises by providing state financing incentives, drawing also on the European Union"s programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Another ray of hope is the fact that Romania and the European Union are cooperating increasingly closely on the joint plans for the use of the Trans‐Caucasian mineral resources, especially those in Azerbaijan and the Central Asian Republics, for the benefit of the European market. Romania can play a key role both in the transport and in the further processing of oil from the Caspian Sea, as I pointed out very specifically in my report early in 1997 on economic cooperation between the EU and Azerbaijan. If they were properly modernised, the plant in Constanza, the largest Black Sea port, and the refineries in Ploesti on the lower Danube could put Romania in a position to establish a new transport route, process a wide spectrum of oil products and thus become one of the top suppliers to the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">The more active the role Romania plays in the joint projects between the EU and the Trans‐Caucasian republics, especially Georgia and Azerbaijan, in relation for instance to transport networks including energy transport networks, the sooner it can realise its potential in a European market that will soon become larger with the accession of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and thus improve its balance of trade and balance of payments. The products in question can then be transported via the Danube and the Rhine‐Main‐Danube Canal to the centre of Europe and then onwards to the Benelux countries and to France. Romania must gear its geographical, industrial and also technological potential, including the Danube transport infrastructure, much more closely to the European market and fully exploit its Danube waterway and rail service capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">The planned high‐speed TGV‐ICE train link from Paris via Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, Munich and Vienna to Budapest is to be extended in a few years" time via Timisoara‐Arat to Bucharest. So on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations – and here I agree with Mr Bernard‐Reymond"s conclusions on Romania"s accession prospects – I would like to encourage Romania resolutely to pursue the road to Europe, following the example of other Eastern European countries, to overcome its temporary weaknesses and to make full use of its development potential as a great Eastern European country.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly urge the Romanian people, its parliament and government, not to give up in spite of the current difficulties and to do their utmost to achieve closer economic cooperation with the EU. They have our support in that endeavour.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wolf </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (DE) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a brief opportunity to discuss what is happening here in more detail. We could say – and that would be half the story and would also be quite true – that internally the European Union"s competition policy is a success story. It is the motive force of European integration and the completion of the single market. That is indisputable and it is well and good.</p>
<p class="contents">But in relations with the applicant countries we also have the problem of unequal economic structures. Under these circumstances we must consider whether we can simply take the same approach to all of them. We now have the further risk – and I believe there is some indication of this in all three countries – that simply because in a sense these countries are each resolved for political reasons to achieve a perfect market economy they will apply a synthetic system of competition rules that are purer than those the Union itself could apply. That would create an inequality which, in my view, would not be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that we are already faced with the problem that the introduction of competition rules on market domination and the introduction of those on state aid were driven forward under different timetables. But that is not the only problem; another is that other aspects that in fact play a part in strengthening or creating markets have not advanced at the same pace. These include the question of public infrastructures, the question, which was raised earlier, of strengthening the capital resources of enterprises, and the question – which I believe we all consider most important – of strengthening the articulation and assertion of interests other than the enterprises" immediate profits in the economic process. For to engage in economic activity does not just mean making profits, it also means reproducing the natural basic principles of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances we must keep asking ourselves in all seriousness whether we really are promoting this process in such a way as to ensure that equal rights are not just enshrined in abstract words but really are guaranteed, that for the first time in their history these countries bordering the Baltic Sea are no longer in a colonial position in relation to western Europe; I am speaking here as a citizen of Kiel, which has its own particular historical background. I believe that is the task we have to undertake. I know it is anything but easy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, firstly, that we must formulate a broader and more political pre‐accession strategy, meaning that we must also promote aspects other than competition policy. So I welcome the fact that some Members have addressed not only the political progress but also the differing problems of individual Baltic states. They too need to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to consider giving specific signs of solidarity to these countries and consider whether these should not go beyond what has quite rightly been proposed here, namely the flexible application of the rules of competition. That is the minimum. What I mean is that it would be quite absurd to apply the rules more rigorously in these cases than we can apply them in Bavaria or Saxony, in other words at home.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also have to ask what more we can do. I think here we must consider – as has been said by others – what instruments we can use for structural development and how we can ensure that they are used as effectively as possible. We must also make sure we do not create any new hierarchies between the countries. Once the decision, which I criticise, had been taken to create a starting line and begin negotiations with all the countries at the same time, under the procedure that was then applied I think it was quite justified for Estonia to be taken first. Estonia is indeed ahead of the other countries in some respects. But this situation could become consolidated if only because that is how it was in the past. We must not allow that to happen. The other countries must be given a fair chance to catch up. And they must be helped to do so. Nor must those countries that need least support be given most just because the immediate effect may be greatest there.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I urge you to take a very careful look at our policy. I have deliberately not discussed the individual countries, although it would be easy to comment on this or that aspect. But as a Member of the European Parliament it is not my job to tell the Estonians, Latvians or Lithuanians what they must do first; instead I have concentrated on what we should do. I believe there is an urgent need for us to address this question in detail, with careful consideration and in that context.</p>

At the time I was chairman of the delegation for relations with Estonia, which was visiting this plant. The head of the plant said to me: ‘Why do I have to label all my furniture for Ikea in Germany with some strange ‘E's? Why does my paint have to be inspected? Why do my standards have to be inspected? You can just sell any goods you like to us here in Estonia, but I have to be inspected because I am selling to you.' You see, that is how it appears in practice. That is the dialogue we have when we visit our new Member States. These agreements which we are going to adopt are a signal to the populations of the countries concerned that we have not forgotten them and that we are continuing to work on precisely the problems which I encountered in Tartu. But sometimes there is a big difference between politics and everyday life. The trade which is also sought by Mr Wolf does not just come of itself. The question is whether we need a common set of rules in the area of competition to make some countries suitable to participate in cooperation in the future. I am thinking in particular of the country for which I am currently responsible, Lithuania, which plays a key role as a transit country for trade with Russia and Belarus. If the country has its competition policy in order and has harmonised its standards and rules in this area, then it is qualified to increase its trade and take on whatever competitors there may be.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should not look at competition policy in isolation. We should also look at environmental and social policy and, when we talk of progress for these countries, it is important that we do not simply measure, as the Commission often does, growth in foreign investment and the economy, but that we also look at how far the countries are able to incorporate aspects of the working environment and social policy into their competition policy.</p>

The road ahead, however, is still a long one. Much work and time is required of these countries for economic and political harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission"s assessments both Lithuania and Latvia have recently caught up with Estonia, which had had a head start. Latvia"s strong economic growth and both Latvia"s and Lithuania"s active commitment to modernise their laws on citizenship, on which Mr Seppänen"s report certainly contains conflicting information, are important steps on the way to realising conditions for EU membership. For this reason it seems very likely that in the medium term all the Baltic countries will be able to join the European Union simultaneously. Although all applicant countries must be assessed according to their own merits, it is important to emphasise that for the Baltic countries to accede simultaneously would have positive repercussions for security policy, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">While the applicant countries are preparing themselves for membership, it is vital to stress the importance of cooperation, for example, between police forces and customs in combating international crime. It is not enough to enact laws and sanction cooperation agreements. The most important, and perhaps the most difficult, issue for the applicant countries is putting these agreements into practice. We in Finland had a regrettable example of this last year, when a criminal gang which had entered the country from Estonia emptied bank cash dispensers in Helsinki, and the Estonian police refused to cooperate with the police in Finland. These small but important issues have yet to be put right.</p>

At the start of his mandate in 1995, Mr Santer described Union enlargement as one of the two principal objectives of the newly appointed European Commission. He described enlargement as a historic opportunity. I should like to support this view. My group also believes enlargement to be a historic opportunity. But may I just make one point. It is a historic opportunity, but it could also prove to be a historic blunder if accession is not properly prepared. In this respect it is crucially important for the present Union to put its own house in order, as the enlargement the Union is now facing – and today"s reports are another small step in this direction – is totally unlike any previous enlargement. On this occasion the applicant countries are countries with a fairly limited market economy. Moreover, their competition and legal systems are not yet ready to incorporate the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> fully.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the applicant countries which need an efficient government apparatus. Above all the Union itself needs a balanced and effective apparatus in order to cope with the problems of accession. It is therefore distressing to have to conclude that with such important decisions before us we are still a long way from having achieved this goal. I hope that the Council, as Mr Fischer announced this morning, will indeed use a new IGC in around the year 2000 in order to put our own house in order.</p>

This will require big sacrifices and changes in their societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few days I have been following, with some concern, the news that among the three Baltic countries, to quote the headlines, a ‘pigmeat war" is starting. This has even led to an exchange of notes among these countries. This year Latvia intends to restrict pigmeat imports from Estonia and Lithuania for a year. Certainly no good will come of these reciprocal reproaches and exchanges of notes for any one of the Baltic countries. We must just hope that this problem is resolved swiftly so that developments towards EU membership for the Baltic countries do not deteriorate.</p>

This is exactly the opposite of what the real task of a European Union should be, namely to promote their successful accession and economic stabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are also the high export subsidies for EU agricultural products, which severely disturb the domestic markets of the applicant countries.

<p class="contents">Perhaps it is the effect of the snow that has fallen, but I just want to recall a situation I found myself in a few years ago. Actually, I was in a dreadful situation, at Vilnius headquarters with President Landsbergis, guarded, if I can call it that, by the Lithuanian National Guard, and the Red Army had just crushed the Lithuanian resistance under its tank tracks. What I mean is that I regard the Baltic countries as an integral part of our European civilisation and they have paid a very high price for their freedom. Lithuania alone saw a quarter of its sons and daughters perish in the gulags.</p>
<p class="contents">What I also mean is that we would be in favour of the enlargement of our European Community to include the Baltic countries, but for the fact that Lithuania is, alas, increasingly a blend of the Soviet Union and the United States, and has nothing to offer beyond an increasingly bureaucratic yoke. That is why we advise our friends in the Baltic countries, and indeed Poland, to be very careful. Their joining a confederal Europe would certainly be a good thing, but they would do well to hesitate before joining this increasingly bureaucratic Europe, which keeps piling on the weight of its decrees and regulations. I do not think that this would be good for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to shut the door of the Community to them but we, for our part, want a different Europe: the one we are fighting for. I would like to take this opportunity to send that message today to our friends in the Baltic countries.</p>

<p class="contents">This agreement which we are debating between the EU and Romania is now four years old. In this period of time Romania has made tremendous progress, great strides have been taken to move the country towards a position that more equates with the west. It can be no coincidence, however, that countries with EU borders have moved faster towards EU membership than others further away. By comparison with its neighbour Hungary, for example, Romania, which does not have a border with one of the 15 current Member States, is way behind.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past under Ceaucescu Romania was a country ill‐at‐ease with itself, a nation distorted by unrealistic ideals and legislation. Any visitor to the country today will notice the progress which has been made towards a market economy. Further progress is needed, but at a speed that is realistic and allows time for people to adjust and for realignments where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schwaiger has referred to competition development, reforms to state companies, the banks and so on. In addition, the Romanian Government must recognise the reforms that it needs to make itself: reforms to the police, to the Constitution, for example Article 200. It must address the reluctance of some of its politicians to accept that tomorrow's politics will be very different from those in Romania prior to the revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, Romania is a very different country today, a very difference place from the Romania of ten years ago. Some things however remain constant: its geographical position is important, as Mr Schwaiger emphasised, and a major plus for its own future development. Romania is of course and will remain European by its culture, by its language, by its history and by its people.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome this report and I for one look forward to being here when we welcome to the European Parliament Romanian Members as colleagues.</p>

It is important for there to be commonly accepted rules for cooperation and relations in the business sector between the European Union and these four countries, and for there to be some security in relation to the ability of businesses to move into and cooperate with these countries. On the other hand, of course, we must bear in mind that they are in a difficult stage of transition which, besides the necessity for certain principles and legal provisions, will certainly require the European Union to show solidarity, support and an understanding of their individual characteristics. I wish to stress the importance of cooperation and the development of relations with Romania, which is one of the largest Balkan countries, in an important geographical position, which is perhaps a long way behind other eastern European countries, but which offers great potential for participation in the major networks of the European Union and Europe in general, as Mr Schwaiger in any event described very well in his explanatory statement.</p>

In ten years, they have moved from dictatorship and a Soviet‐style planned economy to democracy and a market economy. On top of that, there are now the EU adjustments – changes which have imposed heavy demands on people and politicians alike which it has been difficult to meet. There is consequently a need for great flexibility and economic support on the part of the EU to facilitate their continued development. The EU should also be making reciprocal adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">The political and economic pressures on these countries are enormous. It is disturbing that last week one of the Baltic countries introduced a protective duty on pigmeat, thereby opening up a rift between the emerging free‐market countries. However, such a move was not totally unexpected.</p>
<p class="contents">From the start, the Green Group has maintained that accession negotiations should be held with all three Baltic countries simultaneously in order to promote harmonious political and economic development in the area and to avoid endangering the fragile cooperation process.

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should very much like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteurs for their work and also by congratulating them on the quality of the reports presented here today. I should also like to thank Mr Wolf in particular for his comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that such comments are necessary in a debate such as we are now having. Of course you will understand that I do not want to specifically discuss the more global accession problems, which are the responsibility of my fellow Commissioners, but the issue raised here is certainly an important element of these problems. The question here is whether or not the countries concerned can make adequate and effective preparations to be able to perform sufficiently well from the time of their accession.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is not the case, then accidents could happen.</p>
<p class="contents">You will recall, and German Members in particular, how the pace of events at the time virtually wiped out whole sectors and entire companies in the former East Germany, as people were not given enough time to prepare. Once you join the European Community you are subject to the logic of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is so important for these countries to proceed step by step. We must be realistic. This was what happened within the European Union itself. Our countries, the present Member States, took quite some time before they assimilated the policy of competition rules and respect for state aid. As you all well know, even today there remain a great many problems within the European Union. On the one hand we must remain realistic about this issue, but at the same time we must clearly say to all these countries: look, this has to be done, otherwise you will be running a great risk on the day you join. We need to be open and frank with these countries, which is why we have these implementing regulations that we are discussing today. The basic rules have already been agreed under the Europe Agreements, what we are now discussing is their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will come back to the subject of state aid, which some of you talked about. What we are essentially discussing here are the rules on restrictive practices, Articles 85 and 86 in particular, what we might call relations between companies. We are not in fact talking about state aid here, although I shall be coming back to this shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have rules for five Central and Eastern European countries, and now there will be a few more. I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that overall I believe the trend to be quite positive. All these countries have now introduced competition rules, not necessarily identical to the rules we have in the European Union, but then again they are not at present always the same within the Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries are adapting, such as the Netherlands, which has made strenuous efforts over recent years and whose competition policy is now largely in line with that of Europe. In the United Kingdom it is being discussed. This is what is known as soft harmonisation, a harmonisation which is progressively achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not impose identical rules. We ask the states in question to pursue a policy which is similar to that of the European Community and the European Commission in particular, and thus to set up the necessary authorities – as they have done in most cases – which also have the powers and instruments to implement that policy. There are sometimes problems with this, because it takes time before you can develop this culture, before you have sufficient independent authorities which are able to apply these rules and overcome any resistance – and I do not need to tell you how difficult that often is in the European Union, even now. So we should show some understanding for the fact that these countries need time in order to achieve this. But we must of course repeatedly stress just how necessary it remains, and if need be utter a word of criticism, which is what we do. A word of warning, because if it is not done in time it leads to major difficulties, primarily for the countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, in general I believe things are going quite well in this area, but we must be realistic and accept that it will be some years yet before the situation in these countries is more or less comparable to that which now exists in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make a point about state aid. It is here that the question becomes most problematic, including within the European Union. Governments grant state aid, and when they do they always believe it is with good reason. You know that it is our duty in the Union to ensure a response when the situation is unacceptable. But the situation in these countries is very unusual. The authority which grants the aid will itself be responsible for checking that it is granted in accordance with the rules in force within the Union. This is a very special situation, which is why it is causing so many problems. Most countries still have no rules on this, and when they do they are very difficult to apply or else they are certainly not applied sufficiently independently.</p>
<p class="contents">I openly admit that this is also going to be the biggest problem in the future. The more time passes the more problems we have with it. I recently visited Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. I will also try to visit the other countries. But we have realised that the situation in this respect is not at all satisfactory. Take Poland for example, where a whole series of tax‐free areas have been set up close to or on the border with Germany, the <span class="italic">neue Bundesländer.</span> Of course there is bound to be a reaction to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take the example of the steel sector. Countries like Poland and a few others are going to have to reorganise their steel sectors. We also had to do this. It takes time and money. We should take a realistic view of this and say to these countries: do it, but in a way which is socially acceptable as happened in the European Union. So you see there is still a great deal to be done, but I agree with the view expressed by most of the speakers: it must be done, it takes time and we must do it with <span class="italic">Augenmaß, </span> as they say in German. I believe this is precisely the policy we are trying to pursue, but the countries in question must realise that it is a job that has to be done, in their own interests for the day they join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make just one further point and then I will finish. One of the speakers referred to anti‐dumping measures. As long as these countries have no rules for monitoring state aid and we cannot reasonably assume that this discipline exists, anti‐dumping measures will also be applied. The countries know this. The measures can be phased out gradually from the time that these countries adopt a credible policy for supervising state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word on this, ladies and gentlemen. There is at present still a great need for more transparency. By this I mean that governments themselves must take a critical look at what they grant as state aid. I recall a conversation with a finance minister, I will not say from what country, who seemed to believe that fiscal aid should be allowed. In other words, he thought that it was perfectly alright if he gave a company tax exemption. I said no, as this is also a form of state aid, and you need to be very careful about this. I mention this example in order to illustrate that we also need first to draw up a detailed inventory of what government rules exist and second to promote greater awareness of what is and is not allowed. That said, you of course know that all these countries are so‐called A‐regions where state aid is allowed. That is clear. The point is that this state aid must also respect certain rules and be sufficiently transparent. Once again, I thank the rapporteurs and all those who have taken part in today"s constructive debate on this subject.</p>

I pointed out earlier that the Romanian refineries in Ploesti are due to be modernised and that Romania plays a key role as a link between the Trans‐Caucasian oil‐producing countries such as Kazakhstan, but also and in particular Azerbaijan. Is the Commission prepared, firstly, to step up this cooperation and, secondly, to point out to Romania that modernisation should take account of environmental requirements? For if exceptional provisions were allowed in the framework of state aid, then far more emphasis should be placed on environmental aspects in regard to state aid and private investment, which, incidentally, would also be very necessary in the case of the Czech Republic. Could you perhaps give me a brief answer?</p>

We have to proceed through the normal diplomatic channels in regard to environmental questions too. We do not have any direct responsibility here. We have to talk to each other, even when it is a question of aid. If there are any grounds for complaint, the matter is usually settled confidentially, but settled it is. If you want any further details, we can discuss this either bilaterally or with other colleagues.</p>
