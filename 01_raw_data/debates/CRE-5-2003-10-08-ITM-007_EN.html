<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, before I start, I really do want to apologise for the delay: I was detained by duties I had to carry out on behalf of the Italian Presidency, as a result of which I arrived later than the time scheduled for the debate on the agenda. I would also like to thank you, Mr President, and the other Members of Parliament, and the Commission too, for changing the order of business and thus giving me the chance to speak now. I can assure you, Mr President, that I will do everything in my power to avoid this happening again. We will certainly give absolute priority to the relationship between the institutions, as it is right to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the European Parliament for this opportunity to present to the House the main topics on the agenda for the forthcoming European Council, which will take place here in Brussels on 16 and 17 October. On the morning of 16 October, before the European Council opens, the Intergovernmental Conference will hold its second meeting, at the level of Heads of State or Government, assisted by their Foreign Ministers. The proceedings of the European Council itself will start at 4 p.m. with the customary meeting between the Heads of State or Government and the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I present to you the items on the agenda for the forthcoming European Council, I would like to say a few words about the special summit of Heads of State or Government which, as you know, took place in Rome earlier this month to mark the official opening of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus now embarked on the second leg of the constitutional process that began with the work of the Convention and the draft Constitutional Treaty which it drew up. President Cox, let me begin by mentioning your own attendance at the inaugural session, something to which, as you well know, the Italian Presidency attached particular importance. Your fellow Members, Mr Hänsch and Mr Méndez de Vigo, went on to attend the first ministerial meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was held in the afternoon of the same day.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rome summit basically confirmed our shared understanding of the historic nature of this stage in the process of European integration and the need to provide the enlarged Union with cohesive, mutually agreed constitutional foundations; that, we are convinced, is essential if we are to strengthen Europe's internal cohesion and increase the credibility and authority of its international role.</p>
<p class="contents">The atmosphere of the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was attended by the President and Vice-Presidents of the Commission and, as I mentioned earlier, the President of the European Parliament, in addition to the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, the acceding States and the candidate countries, was constructive. There was broad consensus on the fact that the Member States were collectively accountable to Europe's public opinion for ensuring the success of the IGC in the interests of the enlarged Union and of its Member States. The very fact that the Heads of State or Government adopted the Rome Declaration without difficulty is clear confirmation that the adoption of a draft Constitutional Treaty is a shared goal and a vital step for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There were, of course, persisting national differences on specific aspects of the draft Treaty, although the collective intention to adhere to the timeframes we established at Thessaloniki was confirmed. The first ministerial meeting of the IGC resulted in further clarification of the timetable, methodology and organisation of the work which the Italian Presidency intends to carry out in order to provide the Heads of State or Government with all the elements necessary for them to reach a comprehensive agreement at their meeting on 12 and 13 December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will focus primarily on reviving the economy and increasing competitiveness and on certain aspects of European asylum and immigration policy, in particular the issue of the joint management of the Union's external borders and controlling migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council held an initial discussion on the draft annotated agenda at its meeting on 29 September 2003 and will return to the subject at its next meeting, on 13 October, on the basis of an updated version of the agenda, which will also reflect the conclusions of the meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs and Ecofin Councils earlier this month and the meeting of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on 9 October.</p>
<p class="contents">As is customary at summits, the Brussels European Council will also deal with topical international issues. The agenda is still being finalised but I can tell you that, as things stand, the Summit will address the issue of the situation in the Middle East, following the recent, extremely disturbing developments, the situation in Iraq, with a view, not least, to the impending Donors’ Conference, and the situation in Iran, in the context of our endeavour to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, the Italian Presidency intends discussions at the forthcoming European Council meeting to centre on the urgent need to revive the European economy. Let me say straight away, however, that the Italian Presidency does not intend there to be any overlap with the spring European Council. Indeed, in March 2004, as scheduled, we will have our yearly appointment to review the overall implementation of the Lisbon strategy on the basis of the Commission’s report and contributions from the various Council configurations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Italian Presidency does consider that the forthcoming mid-October European Council will afford a useful opportunity for an exchange of views and a policy debate on a highly topical and urgent issue which is a source of concern to us all and on which our opinions converge. In other words, we expect the October summit to provide scope for a debate on economic growth and revival and on the instruments for increasing competitiveness in an economic climate in which Europe's economy is still struggling to seize the opportunities for recovery which are visible in other parts of the world. We also expect the European Council conclusions to provide pointers and commitments to guide the work of the various Council configurations in the months ahead. Indeed, we are convinced of the need to continue with sound macroeconomic policies while, at the same time, speeding up the necessary structural reforms, promoting investment in infrastructure and human capital and adopting economic policies oriented towards growth, job creation and genuine integration of the new Member States into the great single market. The European Council should lay the foundations for a programme supporting growth based on significantly increased investment in major infrastructure networks and in research and development projects, with more substantial private-sector input.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the recent Commission communication and the Ecofin Council decisions on the European Initiative for Growth. We call upon the European Council to give the economy a further decisive boost. Developing the trans-European transport network projects and ensuring that they actually get under way is a matter of particular urgency, not only as a response to enlargement and in the interests of integration between the old and the new Member States, but also in order to remove the obstacles and bottlenecks currently distorting the operation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, the forthcoming European Council is to give its assessment of the Commission's proposed new plan for priority TEN projects and should be able to give a clear, powerful recommendation for the proposals to be swiftly approved. Indeed, we believe that it is essential to set a reliable timetable for implementing the projects in order to stimulate investment-based economic growth and to boost market expectations and business confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy's recent electricity black-out has made us all more aware of the pressing need to complete the creation of a truly integrated European energy market and to strengthen the security of energy supplies, bearing in mind the Member States' heavy dependence on imported energy as well. The European Council will thus need to provide guidance, not least, on better integrating European networks and developing new forms of energy cooperation with third countries, in particular with the Mediterranean partners, with a view to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Energy Ministers in Rome in early December.</p>
<p class="contents">Enhancing competitiveness remains the key to achieving the objectives of growth and job creation. The Italian Presidency understands the need to use the right instruments, both at European and at national level, for organising a genuinely open, competitive market based on knowledge, industrial development and a steadily expanding and diversifying services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment in research, advanced technologies and human capital is vital if we are to achieve our growth objectives. The European Council will be called upon to provide the necessary impetus, stimulating Member States to adopt coordinated measures to ensure tangible progress towards the target investment of 3% of GDP in research and urging industry and all parties concerned to contribute to creating European technological platforms in key competitive sectors of the Union's economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the European Council will also address the social dimension in its work and the vital role played by social protection systems in enhancing the competitiveness of Europe's economies. However, social protection systems across Europe are now having to respond to the challenge of an ageing population, so, while it will be necessary, on the one hand, to ensure that the social dimension is strengthened and fully integrated into the Union's economic and employment policies, on the other, it is just as essential to devise policies for reforming the employment market and to address the issue of Europe's steadily ageing population by reforming benefit and pension systems to make them financially sustainable while, at the same time, maintaining a high level of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, then, at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council, the Presidency will confirm that the timing of the launch of the growth initiative is intended to give a strong signal of sound economic governance and renewed confidence in Europe's economic potential. Given current economic pressures, that signal now needs to ring out loud and clear if we are to sustain the gathering pace of structural reform under the Lisbon agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I close, I would add that – as I started out by saying – the Presidency considers that the European Council may also note some recent developments in respect of the Thessaloniki European Council guidelines on asylum and immigration policies and, more importantly, that it may pave the way for new joint initiatives at European level. The forthcoming European summit will, therefore, be called upon to confirm that controlling migration flows is a top priority and to reaffirm the Union's commitment to promoting a balance between the proper management of legal immigration and renewed efforts to combat illegal immigration. We therefore expect the European Council to call on the Commission, the Council and all Member States to do everything in their power to facilitate and speed up the conclusion of readmission agreements, in particular with the countries of origin or transit of large migration flows while, at the same time, confirming the importance of effective Community action on repatriation, in order to give credibility to Europe's policy on combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">With the imminent enlargement of the Union and the need to make every effort to increase the security of Europe's citizens, the Heads of State or Government will, once again, need to stress that all Member States – old and new – have a common interest in seeing effective mechanisms put in place for the joint management of the Union's borders, particularly its sea borders. The importance of fully implementing the plan for the management of the Union's external borders should therefore be confirmed afresh and the Commission invited to submit at the earliest opportunity a proposal for setting up a border management agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the European Council will call on the Council to complete its work on the proposal for a directive on asylum as soon as possible and will welcome the study launched by the Commission on setting national quotas, with the present and future Member States being urged to cooperate fully with the Commission to that end.</p>

Today, I would like to focus on these two key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration stopped being a purely national question some time ago. It was transformed dramatically into a European question as the ever-increasing flows of immigrants and the increase in related crime set the alarm bells ringing in all the Member States. The management of our borders must therefore become a shared task that we tackle together in the interests of us all. The impending enlargement will extend the Union’s external borders and the new Member States will become almost entirely responsible for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Alone, the new countries are in no position to manage this onerous task, which involves not just policing but also – and perhaps above all – political and social planning. Our human social conscience tells us that unlawful trafficking in human beings and hopeful voyages undertaken under inhumane conditions cannot be tolerated. At the same time, we must address the question of migration flows resolutely and coordinate the management of our common borders. The Thessaloniki European Council showed the way, stressing the need to step up implementation of the Tampere programme, particularly with regard to a common European policy on asylum and migration. At the next Council, the Commission will fulfil the mandate assigned to it by the European Council by presenting a series of measures with a view to completing the common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As an initial move, the idea of setting up an agency for the management and operational coordination of border controls is currently being explored and the Council will be able to take a decision on this by the end of the year. The agency will not replace national border guards. Its tasks will involve organising horizontal operations such as risk analysis, training, research and the procurement of equipment to be loaned to Member States. A special study has been carried out on sea borders with a view to incorporating them in the overall organisation of the Union’s external borders. The Commission will also propose introducing biometric identification methods for visas and residence permits that will later be incorporated into the major computer systems, most notably the second generation of the Schengen Information System. We are also preparing initiatives aimed at making passports more secure. When tackling this extremely sensitive issue, however, we will always bear in mind that the need for security and controls must not jeopardise our citizens’ right to privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The most pressing issue is undoubtedly the question of migration flows. Legal immigrants are actually an economic, cultural and human resource that we must welcome and integrate into our societies as best we can, with due regard for their dignity. A pro-active policy on economic immigration and integration therefore needs to take account of the situation in the immigrants’ country of provenance, our economic and social needs and our effective capacity to integrate the new arrivals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also our duty to combat illegal immigration, however. In the coming months we will need to focus on two instruments: readmission agreements and return policies. As requested by the Council, the Commission has opened negotiations with third countries to establish readmission procedures for citizens who have entered the European Union unlawfully. Although great efforts have been made, these are difficult negotiations because the Commission has to persuade third countries not only to readmit their own citizens but also to allow citizens on their way back to other states to pass through those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our experience shows that the negotiations will be successful only if they are conducted within a broader framework and we can bring to the table a number of incentives. For example, in the Authorised Destination Status agreement we concluded only last week with China, which includes a readmission clause, economic considerations played a significant role. Some might say that they should not have done, but that is the way things are.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important point is the need to offer our partner countries guaranteed immigration quotas, preferably within the context of negotiations involving economic cooperation, development aid and access to markets. Indeed, it is essential that the Member States facilitate our negotiating position so that we can reach fair agreements that help to create the necessary climate of cooperation and trust with the partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All the various stages of any return policy must be adequately financed. To ensure that operations are efficient and are conducted with full respect for the dignity of the persons concerned, in autumn the Commission will propose creating a special financial instrument to fund returns over the period from 2004 to 2006. On the basis of this experience, we will be in a position to include a genuine European Fund for Repatriation in the new Financial Perspective that will enter into force in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we find ourselves having to contend with migration flows in which it is difficult to distinguish between refugees in search of asylum and economic migrants: the two are very often confused. We must therefore offer protection to those in need while, at the same time, regulating access for the others in an organised manner. First and foremost, however, we need to strengthen the institution of asylum, which is an integral part of our humanitarian tradition but which seems to be coming under heavy fire from public opinion in many countries. To implement the Thessaloniki European Council’s conclusions by the end of the year, the Commission will complete the first phase of the development of the common asylum system agreed at Tampere by adopting the two directives not yet in place: one on procedures and one – a complex but important document – on the definition of refugee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn briefly to the other major subject that will be addressed by the Brussels Council: how to help revive Europe’s economy. Needless to say, the last two years have not produced encouraging signs from our economy. The current picture is of weak growth, little confidence on the part of households and businesses and low levels of investment. However, a few recent indicators suggest that the corner may about to be turned – let us hope so – and that the current slump may, at last, be in sight, barring tensions in international politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying economic conditions (the fundamentals) are good because the Member States have stuck to the rules and behaved in less divergent ways, particularly following the introduction of the euro, and thanks to an increased awareness of the need to implement the structural reforms agreed in Lisbon. We must therefore give our economy fresh impetus. To this end, last week, the Commission adopted the European Initiative for Growth, which will now be put before the Council for approval. The Initiative is, of course, based on the Lisbon strategy on investment in networks and knowledge. However, its objective is to mobilise additional public and, above all, new private funds<span class="bold"> </span>in the shorter term to finance European-scale infrastructure projects and boost research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The message to our citizens is, therefore, that we are laying the practical foundations for structural, long-term improvements to our competitiveness. A European transport and communications network is essential to better integrate our economies and to increase cohesion. By demonstrating our determination, we will send out a clear signal that the Union is, at last, able to take economic decisions that can no longer be put off.</p>
<p class="contents">The new market opportunities guaranteed by the financial commitment of the Member States and the private sector will, in turn, encourage direct input from European businesses. The direct effects of the investments in the projects will be seen as soon as work is started on the construction sites, which, in a large number of cases, could be quite soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Initiative we are presenting to you today has benefited from experience gained from previous initiatives and attempts to resolve problems that have caused delays in the past. As part of the strategy, last week, the Commission adopted a package that includes 29 major trans-European network projects involving a total investment of some EUR 220 billion between now and 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the overall picture of what must be achieved if we are to provide the single market with an effective infrastructure to make our economy more competitive. However, it is clear that only certain projects will be ready for implementation in the near future. The Commission will give the European Council an indication of the timetable for completing the works listed to enable the Heads of State or Government to concentrate all their efforts and make the greatest possible contribution to boosting the economy in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Initiative looks for greater private sector investment, there is clearly still a key role for public financing. This makes the balance and, above all, the quality of public expenditure absolutely crucial. We must direct investment towards growth. To increase leverage and thus speed up the completion of the works, we propose increasing the contribution from the Community budget from 10% to 30% for the cross-border aspects of the highest priority projects. This will make it possible to mobilise far greater private sector resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to give the European Investment Bank a greater role, however. To this end, the Initiative proposes to give it a greater role in easing the burden and sharing the financial risks. We will also urge the Member States to step up their investment in research, development and knowledge to encourage the development of physical and human capital. These are the only recipes for safeguarding sustainable employment in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot repeat enough – picking up on what Mr Antonione said about the inadequate level of research – that supremacy in international competition is to be achieved through innovation, centres of excellence and the development and transmission of information and knowledge. We also need to do more in terms of lifelong learning and training for our citizens. In addition to the great efforts they are making in the field of structural reform, the Member States will also, therefore, need to step up their work in these areas, taking advantage of Community resources such as the Sixth Framework Programme, the performance reserve and the mid-term review of the Structural Funds in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must link up the major European research centres, support their activities and make them attractive to academics and scientists throughout the world. There is nothing for it: we must take the decision to provide Europe with the best centres of excellence in the world, for, otherwise, our children will lose enthusiasm for research and innovation. We must concentrate on technical and scientific innovation and on ways of helping manufacturers turn innovation into new processes and products.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the playing fields on which we will win or lose our future prosperity, our influence on the international stage and our capacity to defend Europe’s interests and uphold its values in the world. Therefore, we must find the political will to meet this challenge and press forward resolutely towards the goal which I know you, too, are striving to achieve.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is starting much later than planned, and I would like to apologise because as soon as I finish speaking I will leave to attend another important engagement. This is something I have never done before. I know we all have other commitments, and I was engaged to be elsewhere at 5 p.m. I hope that there will be no repetition of today’s delays.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit of Heads of State or Government in the spring of 2002 did expressly set itself a very ambitious objective, namely to create the most competitive economy in the world. This claim always reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Soviet Union wanted to outdo the US. We know how that ended. Slightly more moderate language would make our present situation – namely the lack of progress – a little easier.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we have to ensure that Europe’s economy becomes more competitive. In order for that to happen, two key conditions must first be met. One is the reform of our social system, and the other is greater flexibility in labour markets. Happily, people are living longer, but this also presents a massive challenge to our social system. Our group feels very strongly that we have to introduce more independence and self-sufficiency into our social systems. We need to make the labour market more flexible, because if the labour market stays as it is, if we maintain the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, people out of work will be hit particularly hard, and these are the very people we want to see return to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group would therefore like to encourage governments which are undertaking a tough reform process to address this issue to keep going, in order to provide us with answers for the future that offer genuine, viable solutions for today’s younger generation.</p>
<p class="contents">The best policy approach for jobs, companies, and particularly for medium-sized companies, is a moderate taxation policy. The less taxes companies have to pay, the more they will be willing to invest in Europe. Today, we know that it is because our current economic system is so bureaucratic and often has very high taxation, that our companies invest outside the European Union. We can therefore only encourage policies which offer the best for medium-sized companies, with maximum transparency in taxation, to show that investment within the European Union is worthwhile, rather than forcing companies, as is increasingly the case, to invest outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mr Karas, our economic policy coordinator, whom I see here, spoke, about Basel II a few weeks ago. We also have to ensure that Basel II does not make it harder for medium-sized companies to invest. Instead we need to conclude worldwide agreements and organise Basel II in such a way that it is possible for medium-sized companies to take out loans and pay them back under reasonable conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of European bureaucracy and the self-inflicted tangles of red tape. Here I am addressing the President of the Commission. We are eagerly awaiting the Commission proposals for chemicals legislation. But if this legislation on chemicals results in European companies again investing outside the European Union because of the thousands of regulations imposed upon them and leaving the European market, then it will lead to further job losses and consequently a less competitive Europe. We would therefore caution against tying the European economy up in more red tape through national or European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment briefly on the question of the stability of the euro. There are some people who believe we now ought to go well beyond the 3% figure established under Maastricht for new borrowings. I can only advise against such a step. If we enter into new borrowings now, those loans will have to be repaid, and the money used to make the repayments will then not be available for investment. It is investment that creates jobs. For this reason the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats recognises the need to uphold the stability criteria, although obviously we do acknowledge the difficulties that national governments are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission and, I believe, the President-in-Office of the Council, have talked about how important it is to do something for education and research. We cannot continue to allow ever more young scientists to go to the United States and thus be lost to us. This represents a loss not only of human potential, but also of the future potential of Europe. The issue must therefore be addressed more directly.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to make a couple of brief remarks about Europe’s borders and the protection of them. It is a very important topic, but I wonder whether it is necessary to create a new border management agency, as set out in the European Council paper. Can we not tackle the problems using existing structures? I am just airing the question now. Let me also encourage the Presidency not to limit discussions at the conference on the Mediterranean dialogue in December to the very important question of borders. Rather, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to also consider how we can help countries to help themselves, particularly those Mediterranean countries which are not members of the European Union, in order to prevent people climbing into boats in order to reach the borders of the European Union, resulting in the tragedies that we keep seeing in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">My last words are a request to the President-in-Office of the Council, and one I think he will follow up. I would like to encourage the President-in-Office to do his utmost to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference comes to agreement by the end of the year. Please do not allow every page of the Convention’s proposals to be completely renegotiated. Concentrate on the three or four key points. We will support you in your efforts to achieve a result, because we need a European constitution. A European constitution is the basis on which this European Union, which will soon comprise twenty-five Member States and 450 million people, will be able to make the decisions it needs to make, will be able to act, to be democratic, and to uphold parliamentary principles. So let me encourage you to concentrate your efforts during the presidency on the constitution. It is the top priority for these six months.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that those of us, myself in particular, who asked that Parliament be adequately represented, appear to have been listened to and I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference, I must say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – and you will understand this given your professional experience – that you have touched our trigeminus, which is the most sensitive nerve in the body, as you are well aware. Why? Because the first thing the Intergovernmental Conference has done has been to get rid of the legislative Council, with some resistance on the part of Germany and Portugal, and that is very serious. It is very serious because we are working on the basis of shared legislative powers and the first thing the Council does is to dismantle something which is essential in a democracy: legislating in the open, in public. It appears to be an appendix to the Council and I naturally support our two representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference who vigorously opposed that outrage. Furthermore, I would say that this is not only a problem you face with us: it is also a problem you face as regards the national parliaments, because the greatest insult is to the parliaments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would repeat my request that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs invite all the members of the Convention from the national parliaments and present them with this problem: how can the legislative Council be dismantled in the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">And having said that, please allow me to focus on my observations relating to the economic aspect. I will leave the task of dealing with the issue of borders to my colleague, Mrs Ana Terrón.</p>
<p class="contents">My comments are based on one particular fact: stability is a public asset; nobody, neither people, families nor States can live beyond their means, and the policy of stability based on combating inflation is a policy in defence of the majority of society. Only property owners, and the bigger the better, can survive and even profit from inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability protects the most humble and the Stability Pact is an urgent objective, but there can be no stability without growth. At the moment the greatest danger to the European economy is not so much inflation but deflation and therefore, having lived through three years of mild recession, all the Member States must address a situation in which there are fewer resources, and they are therefore in a vicious cycle in which they have to increasingly get into debt or reduce investment costs and sometimes both things at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that Europe has chosen the latter route, which is the worst one. Since the end of the last decade public investments have fallen in the European Union by around 1% (in the United States this figure stands at 3%). According to the Commission’s data, investment of 1% means supplementary growth of 0.6%.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that the European States have not taken advantage of the good years. They have not carried out a policy of the ant: they have carried out a policy of the cicada and have not reduced their debt, but it is equally true that the Member States will not recover the virtuous cycle of growth if they restrict themselves to survival or maintenance investments, and if they continue to cut off the citizens’ spending power. What we must do is carry out an intelligent reform of the pact in order not to be guilty of the accusation of stupidity which has been made. Yes, Mr President, I will use the same expression; you will know that it is the only one that does not require translation into any European language: stupidity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be more rigorous in periods of strong growth: for example, the obligation to have a balanced budget on the basis of 3% growth or more, the obligation to use anything that exceeds the 3% growth in order to decrease debt and to leave the States in the euro zone with more flexibility for investment spending during a recession phase. What does not make any sense is to maintain a single level which does not correspond to the Union’s economic reality. Specifically, at the moment Germany and France, with a debt of around 60% of their GDP, have greater room for manoeuvre than Italy or Belgium which exceed it, which exceed 100% by a long way. In other words, we must be flexible here as well.</p>
<p class="contents">And if we were capable of attaching new conditions – something which should be debated at the European Council – to the Stability and Growth Pact, then the second part we have all referred to would come: this formula of returning to a great network of investments in trans-European networks also supplemented by investments in technology and research.</p>
<p class="contents">This was said ten years ago at the European Council in Essen. With enlargement our EUR 400 billion are going to become the EUR 600 billion identified by the Van Miert group with a view to 2020. Well, nothing is being done. We are moving very slowly. An analysis is made and what can be done? The President of the Commission has proposed – if I have understood correctly – that funding should increase from 10% to 30% of the projects. This is a step. What can the other be? It may be a great European loan. Why not?</p>
<p class="contents">Our capacity for debt is intact, we have a euro zone in which 90% of transactions are carried out between the member countries. Why do we not dare to implement a relaunching policy, which no country can do individually, so that there may be results for the whole continent?</p>
<p class="contents">Our budget approximately represents a miserly 1% of Community GDP. The United States deficit for this financial year is equivalent to 6 European Union budgets. I do not propose that we go as far as the United States with the deficit spending, but we could at least make an effort. We have the means but we do not have the will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the evidence of the inaugural meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Rome I fear it is half empty. When the Member States convene again to discuss Europe's draft constitution, they should recall the shambolic Nice Summit and reflect on the costs of failure. Poland and Spain should be reminded that their intransigence over the reform of voting weights in Council is perilous politics as well as poor mathematics.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Nice arrangements were satisfactory, the Council would not have established a Convention in the first place. The system of majority voting agreed at Nice is unwieldy and unfair. To its credit, the Convention threw out the unsteady compromises of Nice and proposed a voting system which is fairer and more transparent. Last time I checked, the representatives of the Spanish and Polish Governments had signed up to the Convention's outcome: now they must respect its work.</p>
<p class="contents">On other issues too, the hard bargaining has been done. The consensus crafted by the Convention will not be improved on in Rome. Unpick the substance of the draft Treaty and the IGC will drag on into 2004 and descend into diplomatic farce. Then Rome really will be the eternal city.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to economic reform and the Stability Pact, the bubbles in the prosecco have long evaporated. France has yet to convince us that it takes its responsibilities seriously. <span class="italic">La France désire-t-elle vraiment jouer le rôle du 'je-m'en-foutiste'? Il faut voir. </span>While we understand the reluctance of some governments to confront France, a Stability Pact without teeth is a paper dragon breathing tinsel flames. The eight governments which have worked hard to play by the rules - often at considerable political cost - have every right to be dismayed that their larger neighbours take fiscal laxity so lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian presidency's drive to enhance Europe's competitiveness at the European Council is welcome. But we need to move beyond bold declarations. To achieve better and simpler legislation we need proper consultation and business impact assessments. A level playing field for company take-overs is still frustratingly far away and we have much work to do to agree a viable framework for an integrated market in investment services before the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">My group welcomes this week's decision by finance ministers to refocus the growth initiative away from road and rail projects and towards investment in innovation which will help to close Europe's research deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, there is more sparkle in the Council's agenda. The balance which the Liberal Group seeks to ensure between tackling illegal migration and providing for a system of managed legal migration seems to be essentially there. We will support the Commission in its efforts to create a Border Management Agency. Europe's new eastern border will be one of the longest in the world: it is crucial that we pool our expertise in policing it properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the external agenda of the Union leaves us no cause for celebration. The failure of Cancún must redouble our determination to secure reform of the WTO and trading arrangements which help the world's poorest countries. Europe must insist on a central role for the United Nations in return for the internationalisation of the situation in Iraq. And the tragic events of the past week in the Middle East confirm the need for Europe and America to remain engaged. My group condemns unreservedly the suicide bombings in Haifa, but calls on Israel to abide by international law and act proportionately in its response.</p>
<p class="contents">A new Constitution, a credible Stability Pact, a revitalised economy, a secure and just Europe in a more stable world: these would be the flavours of a truly vintage year: <span class="italic">le auguro buona fortuna per la vendemmia</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I too must apologise to Council and Commission for having to leave before the end of this debate. The rescheduling of this debate has caused me this embarrassment.</p>

In addition to these countries, the entire euro zone is experiencing an economic downturn and, in many ways, a downturn in social protection too. There is now such a wide gulf between the supposed benefits of the completion of the internal market and the introduction of the euro and the everyday realities of our fellow citizens that we are entitled to call for a genuine public and pluralist evaluation of the guidelines that have been followed and of the instruments with which the Union has implemented these guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the course of action I have recommended bears no relation at all to the anti-European demagoguery of some senior political leaders – starting with those of my own country, Mr Watson – who use such talk to cover themselves in the eyes of their electors. These leaders accuse Brussels in order to make people forget that their own Head of State personally negotiated the Treaties and signed the Stability Pact. They only complain about the harshness of the procedures in force when they themselves are faced with a powerful and entirely legitimate resistance movement made up of workers in their own countries. Above all, they do not call into question the very mindset of the stability pact and even less that of the Phare institution whose pact is ultimately just its bodyguard: the European Central Bank. Its mandate and its statutes make those of the Central Bank appear to be the most liberal and untouchable in the world. This is precisely why I believe the evaluation that I have just mentioned to be so necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that when economies are so interdependent, there must be common rules and these must be observed. What rules, though, and to achieve what objectives? This is the crux of the matter. What have we gained from this approach of attracting capital in rivalry with the United States, at the cost of a permanent and almost obsessive quest to bring wage costs down and to check social spending? What have we gained from this cult of price stability, at a time when our economies are suffering, not as a result of inflation but of deflation? Do you realise what each of these fine steps forward praised by Commissioner Solbes mean for people’s lives? In France, today, they are nothing more than a good mark, given for freezing public spending until 2007 and even reducing it – and this covers the budgets for young people, education, work, accommodation, transport, research – and for halving current health spending. This is an unacceptable prospect for the French people, and for the citizens of Germany, Italy, Portugal or anywhere else and I believe it is frankly irresponsible to have forced the future Member States beforehand to undergo shock therapy – which actually consists of shocks without any therapy – in the name of an <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> or accepted body of Community legislation which, incidentally, is by no means accepted by millions of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there is a deep need for social transformation and, therefore, for change in European policies. It would be marvellous if the European Council did not create a deadlock over this clear state of crisis and instead gave us its diagnosis and solutions, followed by a real debate with our fellow citizens. One alternative approach is for us to address monetary policy and hence the role and workings of the European Central Bank. The priority of monetary policy and of the ECB must, we believe, be to promote human capacities and consequently, first of all, making employment and training more secure for everyone. Their task would then be to make our countries much less dependent on the financial markets. Politics must control the market and not the other way around. Consequently, the idea of a selective credit policy, which would be extremely favourable to the investments that support our new political priorities but a real deterrent to those who do not support them, would come up against a genuine confrontation of opinions. This, in any event, is the type of debate that needs to be held to enable Europe’s citizens to state their feelings about the draft Constitution in full knowledge of the facts.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, quite a few of my colleagues have already drawn attention to the precarious economic situation and have also asked for structural remedies to be put in place. Nevertheless, we are being bombarded with conflicting reports on a daily basis. Here in Belgium, people have been hit hard by the report, this week, that 3 000 workers in Ford Genk are to lose their jobs. The fact that a reduction in the sales of a specific car model can have such an impact, that heavy and promised investments were withdrawn and that all this employment disappears in one fell swoop, can also have major implications for the rest of Europe. Today, the lead article of an important newspaper was entitled: ‘Is Ford set to disappear across Europe?’ I do not want to dwell on this any further, but I would still like to ask you to come up with realistic solutions that no longer create the impression that employment is something that capitalists can play about with. People now have the impression that they are being put upon.</p>
<p class="contents">A second concern which you expressed is that for peace. You know that our great concern with regard to the Middle East is growing by the day. Since the war in Iraq, peace has not been established. We would like the United Nations and the European Union to be able to play their part there, but it is with sorrow that we see how the entire region seems more and more to think that it can offer military solutions. The fact that a wall is now being erected there, partly even in occupied territories, to screen Israel from the Palestinians, makes a mockery of the phased plan's intention. The fact that new settlements are still being planned makes a mockery of the phased plan. Where does the phased plan lead? It is a road to nowhere. We must take action. We must monitor this plan at ground level, and we must ensure that the situation does not escalate any further. What happened after the dramatic attack in Haifa, an attack deep in Syria, and one that we deplore and denounce, simply invites further military escalation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish parliament’s decision to send troops to Iraq from Turkey, goes against the wishes of the Turkish population, but has been taken under American pressure; it also goes against the wishes of the interim government and of the Iraqi Kurds and is clearly intended as a threat to the PKK. The Turkish population fears, with good reason, that this will spark another spiral of violence. The Iranian regime too, whilst meeting with strong criticism from public opinion at home, is reaping profit from the situation in Iraq. They are the victors. They are gaining more influence over their Shiite fellow believers, not only in society, but even in the government, and they are now putting the pressure on to destroy the Mujahedin. This is once again an attempt to force a military solution, a bogus solution in other words, while we continue to talk about a roadmap to peace. I am asking the European countries, the Commission, the Presidency of the Council to come up with answers to these pressing questions. Can we still, under these circumstances, cooperate with Israel without imposing conditions? Can we still keep the Association Agreement in operation? Can we continue to turn a blind eye to the obvious presence in Israel of nuclear weapons, kept in reserve as a political lever, but also as an alibi to be able to wage conventional wars more easily? Is it not there that we should be looking for weapons of mass destruction? Should the Atomic Energy Agency not intervene and do its job?</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking for a less resigned and a more active stance on the part of the Quartet, and I hope that we can still curb the spreading of war and that we can truly turn into the direction of peace once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coming so soon after the Rome Council meeting, it is in itself a clear indication by our leaders of their intent to put in place measures to reinvigorate the European economy. The European economy needs to be reinvigorated. This year growth has been less than 1%, which by any standards is an exceptionally poor performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst economic fundamentals remain basically sound, growth within the European Union is clearly sluggish and investor and consumer confidence is very low. We must really answer the question as to what we must do to turn around this economic situation. The bottom line, as a number of colleagues have said here this afternoon, is that now is the time for decisive action to be taken. The Lisbon Strategy must be implemented in its entirety across all its strands. The European Union must become the strongest knowledge-based economy in the world. This is imperative if we are to remain competitive and attract direct foreign investment into our community. This means that we must take full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies that are coming on stream. Equally, the benefit of new technologies must be spread to all regions in Europe and to both urban and rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union leaders must work towards completing all outstanding components of the EU financial services action plan, as well as creating a level playing field for mergers and company take-overs.</p>
<p class="contents">Completing a fully-effective internal market requires the progressive creation of an integrated market for gas and electricity to enhance security of supply in Europe. European leaders must look to promote initiatives which guarantee that pension payments can be made in the future for an ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the economic nature of this summit, it would be very hard for European Union leaders to ignore the escalating violence in the Middle East, and nor, indeed, should they. I believe that the European Union has a role to play in brokering a ceasefire between the various factions in the Middle East and I would strongly urge the Italian Government, Commissioner Patten and the High Representative, Mr Solana, to continue to remain actively involved in the Middle East at this critical juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, discussions will undoubtedly take place on the margins of the summit with regard to the provisions of the new European Union Treaty. It appears that negotiations in this respect started quite well at the weekend and we wish the Italian presidency every success in giving us, at the end of the day, a package that will be for the benefit of the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seventy-eight per cent want there still to be a Commissioner from each country. Only 12% are prepared to do away with such a representative. The Danish Government has therefore now at long last joined the chorus demanding a Commissioner from each country. I collected 123 signatures to that effect in the Convention. For all that, it does not form a part of the Convention’s draft, and this shows how the word ‘consensus’ can be misused when ordinary democratic procedures involving proposals, amendments and votes are abandoned. Better late than never, however. Will the Presidency of the Council now confirm that it is campaigning for a Commission with a representative for each country with full rights?</p>
<p class="contents">The next demand must therefore be that it should be the voters themselves or the national parliaments that choose their Commissioners. The elected representatives, who are answerable to their national parliaments, could report – in the Danish representative’s case, each Friday to the Europe Committee – on what they did the previous week and on what they intend to vote for the following week. They could inform the public and act as the elected representatives of the voters in the body that has a monopoly on tabling legislative proposals. They could be the voters’ representatives in Brussels instead of Brussels’ representatives in relation to the voters. Being elected by the national parliaments would be no obstacle to the Commissioners’ also being accountable, as managers of their portfolios, to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. On this point, the next Treaty should include a proper statement of the Commissioners’ responsibilities, corresponding to the ministerial responsibility familiar from civilised democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">A minister or a Commissioner must also be responsible for things about which he or she was unaware. We cannot have a Solbes, who does not accept responsibility because he did not know what was going on in Eurostat. He has managerial responsibility, whether or not he is to blame. He must accept responsibility and, in the process, ensure that the culprits are held to account. Before the Constitution is finally adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference, every subject in it should be discussed thoroughly by the people. How will the Presidency guarantee that the outcome does not come as a bad surprise for the majority of voters in our countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fear that – sadly, once again – there will be no discussion as to what the European Union and the European Institutions could do to encourage and to contribute to the EU’s economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, a little more than a year ago, you commissioned a high-level group of experts to carry out a study on an agenda for a Europe with an expanding economy. This study made some very specific, very thorough and very important recommendations on what the European Union could do to contribute to growth, first and foremost by re-orientating its own internal budget, that of the European institutions: in fact, we also need to question the approach taken by the European budget, to ask to what extent it helps economic growth. This group of experts, then – the committee chaired by André Sapir – made an extremely clear proposal: re-direct the European institutions’ budget, the 1.25% of European GDP, which is only a small amount but is being put to very poor use and does not serve to contribute towards European growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation was quite clear: a major political decision has to be made, and this decision involves removing the burden of the common agricultural policy, which takes up and accounts for almost half of our funds, from the European budget. The funds that would be freed up by merely rethinking agricultural policy and agricultural protection, which has such a negative impact on the image of Europe abroad, could – thanks, not least, to the leverage effect – help give an enormous boost to economic research and to technological innovation, which needs to be financed by large-scale saving which only Brussels can provide. These same resources could also be used to boost the implementation of the infamous European networks to better connect markets.</p>
<p class="contents">All this could be done, but it is not being done. I believe that, at European level, we need, first and foremost, to reassess our budget and our agricultural policy, otherwise, it will become increasingly pointless to pontificate about the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">One final thought, Mr President: immigration will be discussed. This is a good thing and I hope that a clear signal will be given to European citizens that immigrants are and can be an asset to economic growth rather than a problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, the result is favourable on the whole: the adopted text gives us good cause for hope after the pessimistic forecasts beforehand. I, personally, am optimistic, having experienced the Convention’s shilly-shallying, problems and difficulties; I am absolutely convinced that no one will want to take responsibility for letting two years work fail, no one will want to take political responsibility for failing to give Europe the Constitution that 450 million citizens are expecting.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, no substantial compromise should be made on the Constitution text; of course, small adjustments will have to be made, but the balance of the Constitution should remain as it is. What adjustments can be made? I firmly believe that the areas where majority voting is used should be extended: unanimity is an obstacle; it is a concrete pillar blocking the EU’s progress. I also firmly believe that a compromise can be reached on the number of Commissioners: in my view, the countries that will be part of the EU from 2004 should be represented from the outset; subsequently, we could see if we could get round the problem by using Commissioners without portfolio, but I feel that, to start with, there has to be a Commissioner for each of the countries that will be a Member of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, I also firmly believe that an explicit reference to Europe’s Judaeo-Christian roots should be written into the preamble to the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pause a moment to praise the Italian Presidency – as Mr Barón Crespo has just done. A commitment was made in the Chamber in Strasbourg to ensuring that the European Parliament was represented at the Intergovernmental Conference: this has been the case and can be seen as a success for this House. I am sure that Parliament will be able to continue to make a useful contribution during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue, Mr President, is reviving the economy. Yesterday – and we can only welcome this – Ecofin gave the go-ahead for the first step in implementing the trans-European networks: these are major plans that will create new jobs as well as making our regions and our countries more competitive. When prioritising, President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we need to focus clearly on a Europe that is going from the West towards the East, but also at the Europe which is looking from the North to the South.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only revive the economy by pursuing the Lisbon process: raising the retirement age is a necessary reform, we need to give an answer to our children so that there is a system which guarantees their future in 10, 20, 30, 40 years’ time. Furthermore, I also agree with Mr Prodi on the issue of research: this is a commitment made by the current President-in-Office of the Council in his speech in Strasbourg, and I firmly believe that the future of our economy depends on promoting investment in research as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the final issue, immigration, it cannot be a national issue. Italy has 700 km of coastline, which is not just the Italian border, but also Europe’s southern border. Because of this, there is absolutely no doubt about the fact that it is the EU’s duty not only to take on some organisational responsibility, in terms of policing measures, but also to shoulder economic responsibility in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The public will take a sceptical view of this Europe of ours for as long as they feel that nothing, or virtually nothing, is being done to provide them with more jobs. They will also take a sceptical view of the European Union for as long as they do not see investment in their infrastructure, sufficient to modernise it and to make our continent more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Not merely economic but also psychological factors are involved in restoring to Europe the courage and determination it will need to be a leading continent. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that there is to be more investment in infrastructure and in research and development. In ECOFIN, the finance ministers have once again got cold feet. Mr Watson may be happy with that, but I am not, and I hope that the prime ministers will get the better of their finance ministers when it comes to real investment in the modernisation of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the market in electricity. Does not our liberalisation of the electricity market without ensuring sufficient investment, especially in the grid, create a problem? We will now have the same problem with the railways. We have decided to deregulate them, and are in the process of putting together a second railways package, which will mean cutting tariffs and prices. If, however, we do not at the same time require the public sector – and, where possible, the private sector – to invest in the railway network, we will see the same thing happen as has happened in Great Britain, where too little investment has meant also too little investment in people’s safety, more accidents and hence a discredited public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, I believe, it has to be made abundantly clear that this is not about jeopardising the Stability Pact. If anything today endangers the Stability Pact, it is the rigidly dogmatic interpretation of it, which leads the public to see it as a bad thing. If it is applied intelligently, sensibly and flexibly, in the way that the President of the Commission has called for on many occasions, without it taking us back to a massive Budget deficit, then that will be the Stability Pact’s salvation, as the budgets that are currently at risk are not in that position through too much being invested in the countries in question; many of them are at risk from excessive consumer spending. Investment, though, would make for increased growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something brief about foreign policy. Reference has already been made to the situation in the Middle East, and it will be further discussed tomorrow. I believe that the Council, and the European Union as a whole, must unambiguously repudiate terrorism and make that clear to any and every country that flirts with it – which is not always to say that they support it, but that they tolerate it. It must, though, be made equally plain to Israel that it must not perpetuate the cycle of violence or even, perhaps, set one in motion. Recent months have seen quite enough acts of aggression in the Middle East, founded on the assertion that there were dangerous weapons here, weapons of mass destruction there, and terrorism somewhere else still, all of which has often turned out to be untrue. We have to make it perfectly clear to Israel that, while we endorse its firm commitment to self-determination and to countering terrorism, it too has a contribution to make towards achieving peace.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may make a final comment, you said nothing about Russia and Chechnya. Chechnya has just had elections that were a farce, and I think we also need to speak plain language to Russia, which is an important partner for the European Union. Your prime minister, Mr Berlusconi, thinks highly of Mr Putin, he is a friend of his and gives him very warm welcomes. At the same time, though, Mr Berlusconi is not inclined to mince his words. I believe that Mr Berlusconi should tell Mr Putin quite bluntly that we cannot put up with what is going on in Chechnya. This is the time for Russia, too, to work out a policy for bringing peace to Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that, like Mr Barón Crespo, I greatly regret the suppression of the notion of the Legislative Council, a decision which will not foster the separation of powers within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The more serious problem appears to be caused by Spain and Poland, on the grounds that they are to lose the blocking minority they enjoy beneath the Treaty of Nice. I have to say that these are spurious grounds for complaint. The facts are that Spain and Poland need several more partners to join with them to reach the 38% of the population needed to block a decision. The Convention proposes to lower the QMV threshold from 62% to 60%: a mere 9 million people. This is at best a marginal question of bruised self-esteem for Spain and Poland. On Thursday, I trust the true friends of Spain and Poland will explain to Mr Aznar and Mr Miller that they should drop their complaint and assist the IGC in reaching a speedy political agreement to respect the first and second parts of the Constitution. The IGC will then be free to proceed to refurbish and modernise Part III, which is its proper responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Modifying the spirit of the Stability Pact, therefore, is not enough. Neither is implementing it more flexibly. It is becoming increasingly obvious that an in-depth review of the pact’s objectives and criteria is required if monetary and budgetary policies are to contribute to economic growth and employment. I would like to ask the Commission and the Council the following question, therefore: when calculating the 3% budget deficit, are you prepared to discount, with immediate effect, public spending and costs incurred as a result of exceptional circumstances, such as the fires which devastated Portugal this summer? Such a measure is urgently needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, here it comes again – the Intergovernmental Conference. The bazaar is open to those who trade in national interests. The governments have again seized control of the European constitutional process and act out the wielding of their power in splendour and pomp on a feudal stage, on which they make great affirmations of belief in Europe, whilst behind its scenery, people are already shouting the odds about their national interests. Although the Convention must be silent, now is the time for this House to speak up as the trustee and advocate of this, the greatest possible European consensus.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We cannot stand by and watch as this replay of Amsterdam and Nice, perhaps with the outcome of Nice II or Nice III, takes us to the slippery slope and back to the lowest common European denominator. Far from being a task force or a preparatory group composed of motley experts, this Convention was a unique forum of all the national parliaments, including those of the accession countries, including those of Spain and Poland, of all the national governments, including those of Finland and Austria, and it was also a forum for the European institutions, Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">After eighteen months of negotiation, a great and historic consensus was achieved. Under pressure from the governments, the Convention cut much of it out. The parliaments were represented; it is they, rather than the governments, who are the masters of the treaties, and they wanted to go a good deal further alongside us. Under pressure from the governments, we made great compromises. Now is the time for us, in this House, to remind the governments that negotiations involve such a thing as good faith, and that, at the end of eighteen months of negotiations, you cannot behave as if you were not there and put on a shadow-boxing show that pits large against small and East against West, bearing no relation whatever to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very much surprised that the President of the Commission had nothing to say about this historic course of events, but large versus small is not Europe’s game. Simply rotating the presidencies of both the Commission and the Council is enough to represent the equality of all countries. It is, though, the attack by the national executives on European parliamentary life that must be combated, and it will be the public who will pay the price.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a Legislative Council was central to the separation of the powers in the European democracy, central to Parliamentary control of the Council, central to the public character of European lawmaking and to the idea of its proximity to the citizen – yet it was disposed of at the first sitting! Disposed of consensually at the first sitting, without asking either the parliaments or the European institutions, all of which had asked for it! This is an attack on the hard-won majority decisions that were to make Europe capable of acting! The European Public Prosecutor, the public nature of lawmaking – this is not shadowboxing; this is an all-out assault on the very idea of Europe’s new architecture as a European democracy and as a great step forward towards its political unification. It is for us in the European Parliament, being also delegates to the Convention, to publicly denounce this national tug-of-war, to do so with all possible determination, and as loudly as we can, so that it is not just nationalism that makes its voice heard in Europe, but also the ideal of political unity!</p>

Courtesy is not, however, the most common feature of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, one of your illustrious predecessors, Jacques Delors, said in a recent interview that the European Parliament would do better to deal with matters of concern to Europe’s citizens rather than focusing on human rights in Guatemala or on women’s rights in Equatorial Guinea. These are undoubtedly interesting matters but, at the moment, what Europeans are more concerned with – and something that the Brussels Summit, if I am not mistaken, is due to address – is the incredible growth deficit that is threatening to engulf the European economy and, within the European economy, those countries in particular that chose to put their fate in the hands of the euro and the European Central Bank. Whatever the criteria selected, be it debt, deficit, growth, unemployment, inflation – the three Member States that did not opt for the euro and which have kept their national currency are doing the best, including – see the Commission report on this matter – in the field of competition and the Lisbon strategy. The three countries that should be stepping up to receive their medals are the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, which has, moreover, just given an unequivocal response to European monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the Brussels summit is due to oversee the changeover between Mr Duisenberg and Mr Trichet, perhaps it could consider the policy that has been conducted since the euro was introduced in 1999? Incidentally, Commissioner Prodi, that event is something for which your mandate will be remembered, because you took office before the euro had been introduced and you will leave after it has been established. One incredible aspect of this currency is that it is propelled towards peaks by the dollar – not of its own free will but like a cork tossed up by the power of the wave – whereas everyone knows that thousands of jobs are being axed every day, as the result both of a Malthusian policy and now of a negligent attitude towards the currency market which makes the euro the main handicap to the European economy, particularly for the countries in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, on this matter, which is one of the European citizens’ deepest concerns, is anyone going to remind the European Central Bank of its job, which is to ensure growth, or at least to ensure that we have a currency that benefits the European economy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council has to move on, then – that is what the <span class="italic">Lega Nord</span> is calling for – spurred on, not least, by the effective impetus of the Italian Presidency. It is precisely on these issues that we were pleased to hear a clear, precise report by Mr Antonione, representative of the Italian Presidency, on the lines that are emerging from the Justice and Home Affairs Council’s work and discussions: a substantial proposal to set up a border management agency, particularly for sea borders. Mr Tajani rightly pointed out the importance of having 700 km of borders in our country, at Europe’s southern boundary.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the quota policy, and thus integration, which must be dealt with in relation to employment and not with populist proposals that give too much ground, such as the proposal put forward by Mr Fini to give the vote to third country nationals: this would be a step in the wrong direction, it is an inappropriate proposal which is out of place, which goes in the opposite direction from a responsible, specific commitment – the direction in which the European institutions are going – to strive to oppose illegality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Italian President-in-Office of the Council stressed that this Conference is the Conference of European will, of Europe’s will to be Europe and political will is going to be the keyword of this Intergovernmental Conference. The groundwork has been done by the European Convention, chaired by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and it is now up to Ministers to demonstrate that they have this will with, of course, the additional possibility of improving the draft Constitution that we now have.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States of the Union are openly threatening to oppose any outcome that would call into question what they call the ‘Nice <span class="italic">acquis</span>’. I deplore this attitude, because stability must not be confused with stasis. Was it not, after all, the Laeken European Council that fervently wanted the Treaties to be revised to ensure more democracy, more simplicity and more transparency? Besides, following the unanimously acknowledged success of the Community method, so brilliantly illustrated by the European conventions on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on the Constitution, our partners cannot act as if the Union were simply an intergovernmental organisation. We must lead the way in order to ensure that enlargement is a success.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming European Council must also apply itself to revitalising the economy, as several speakers have said. On this subject, I am pleased at the growing awareness of the fact that the stability chapter of the European economy should not be able to relegate the chapter dealing with growth, business start-ups and employment into second place. Our citizens expect their leaders to create conditions that will enable Europe to be dynamic, prosperous and more cooperative. Only by freeing our economies of the burden of excessive taxation and excessive bureaucracy will we be able to create lasting wealth and enable the majority of society to benefit from this wealth. This once again requires the political will to undertake reforms that are far-reaching and sometimes relatively unpopular in the short term. Some countries in the Union, including France, are boldly setting about this task and I hope that these efforts are not only acknowledged but also receive encouragement from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in the field of external relations, I wish to tell the Presidency of the Union how important we consider the Rule of Law together with protecting human dignity to be in managing the external borders of an enlarged Europe, as well as respect for the international legitimacy of the UN in combating international terrorism. Whether in the European Union or elsewhere in the world, now is the time for multilateralism and for joint action and not for going it alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have spoken, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of new common initiatives at European level in the field of immigration. Do you know why it worries me? Because we have not yet reached any agreement on any of the old European common initiatives in the field of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It worries me enormously that we are increasing the volume of paperwork that we already have in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on European initiatives in this field without achieving any results.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one single Directive (of those proposed by the Commission), just one, on which an agreement has been reached: the one on family regrouping. And it is a compendium of exceptions – there are more exceptions than there are Member States – and it is such a weak Directive that we will have to wait to see what this Parliament does with it. Because, in reality, what it has generated inside and outside this Parliament is enormous frustration.</p>
<p class="contents">We need agreements on what the Commission has already proposed in relation to the legal framework for the management of legal immigration. We do not need a lot more ideas: they are all on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">I am worried also because when we talk about new initiatives, we talk about somersaults. Somersaults like the one the President of the Commission has communicated to us and which is entitled ‘European fund for the return of immigrants’. This leaves me entirely perplexed. Can you explain to me the added value of action relating to the return of immigrants? Can you explain to me what contribution will be made by a European fund which cannot be created at the moment by the Member States, who have full competence in the field of return? Are you telling me that they cannot exercise these competences because they do not have sufficient money to do so and that we therefore need a European fund in order to implement the national competence of expelling citizens who are here illegally? I really do not understand this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am however in agreement, and I think it is a good idea, with the common management of borders. I do actually believe that we need to do something here, and I would be in favour of supporting the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that an element of border control relates to immigration and another which relates to crime, as you have said. I am very much in favour of combating organised crime and I would like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether, in this field and within the field of justice and home affairs, you believe you will be able to implement the European arrest warrant before the date set, as planned by this House and the Council? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council continues to focus mainly on keeping people out of Fortress Europe. We still have no agreement on integrating legal immigrants, or on core aspects of a common asylum system; no agreement on making racism illegal in criminal law, and no agreement on fighting human trafficking through protection of victims and encouraging them to be witnesses. For all the rhetoric, how many people-traffickers have actually been put behind bars?</p>
<p class="contents">The summit will look at all the proposals for developing new databases on EU and foreign citizens, including biometric identifiers. This all raises big questions of privacy and civil liberties, but it has been done in secret and with no democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope leaders will rectify their shameful failure so far to act jointly to secure release or a fair trial in a civil court for the 25 Europeans in Guantanamo Bay. We are meant to have a common foreign policy and a human rights policy. So far, for those citizens in Guantanamo Bay, there is little to show for this.

In principle, we are in favour of these projects, which should focus not only on transport but also on the environment, telecommunications and research and development, as set out in the Franco-German initiative. Indeed, we believe that these works should – in principle – eventually improve productivity in the internal market. They should – also in principle – be eligible for part-funding by borrowing because they will benefit future generations, on the condition, however, that we do not allow debt to get out of control. This, though, is where the problem lies. We have serious doubts as to the ability attributed to these projects to stimulate growth.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, of course, there will be delays in implementing the projects, but this is not the key issue. The key issue is that their benefits will be impeded, or even cancelled out by the problems holding back growth in Europe and which have almost brought it back to zero. There are first of all structural constraints, such as the reduction of the working week in France, which are not being corrected as rapidly as they should be. We then have the phenomenon of industrial and agricultural relocation that is causing problems for Europe, a phenomenon that we have condemned since the Uruguay Round and which is now growing worse, with terrible consequences for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The third factor that is pushing us towards a situation of zero growth are the rigidities of monetary union, which admittedly provides some advantages, such as eliminating national currency fluctuations, but which also has disadvantages, such as eliminating a decentralised and flexible form of monetary management only to replace it with a centralised and uniform system. Even in the context of the current system, we should at least try to conduct a more active currency policy that punishes our economy less. In any event, Mr President, unless these three serious obstacles to growth are removed, major works will not stimulate growth and, even worse, will put us in debt for no good reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is remarkable that the media always emphasise the differences of opinion between the governments, an issue completely unrelated to the true meaning of such a treaty for the EU’s own citizens. It would be much better – as many are aware – to explain to the citizens that the object of the exercise is to guarantee the same level of legal protection for every EU citizen throughout the European Union, and that this is particularly achieved by including the Charter in the Treaty. This is a fantastic achievement and it is worth pointing this out very clearly in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone says that they are agreed on 90% of the result that is presently before us, but, in fact, too much notice is being taken of the 10%, which could not possibly be very important, especially since the Council is now clearly stating that there is consensus about the basic ideas. This is what should characterise the publicity surrounding the Convention results. In terms of our relations with the outside world, the drawing up of the Constitution is also extremely important, because no third country should be in any doubt about the fact that the European Union is an alliance of democratic constitutional states. This fact cannot be altered and on this score, nothing should be overlooked. We should say this emphatically to some Balkan countries, as we do to Turkey. Needless to say, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much hopes that the structural reforms themselves will be assessed on the basis of a wide European outlook, taking into consideration the interests of all and the need for clarity for the sake of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a small point about the appointment of Commissioners. You often hear that every country should have its own Commissioner. It seems to me a matter of extreme importance that we in this House should, at some point, spell out to the outside world that, as soon as we discover that a Commissioner has adopted a national stance, we then step in to remove them from their post. Karel van Miert, from Belgium, once stated in his memoirs that the minute you are sworn in as Commissioner, you lose your nationality. Whatever we decide with regard to appointing Commissioners, we should constantly bear this in mind: never and on no occasion should the impression be created that the appointment could be of a national nature.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a foreign policy issue about which I should like to say something. Certain things are going extremely well, for example the police missions in Bosnia Herzegovina and in Macedonia, or the military action under the leadership of one of our Member States in Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know, however, that major problems still exist elsewhere, for example in western Africa, where various fires are smouldering. We as a civil superpower can play a preventive role in the countries where violence has not yet broken out. Our role is then to damp down the fires in neighbouring areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would in this connection mention Guinea-Bissau, which is in urgent need of assistance in the run-up to regular elections, which it now wants, and aid from Europe will certainly be needed. I would thus invite the Council and the Commission to explore the possibilities for peaceful intervention to maintain peace in that country.</p>

<p class="contents">I am also very pleased to note that Mr Prodi’s report and the report that we have drawn up as the Presidents-in-Office of the European Council are in perfect harmony. I hope that this presages excellent work, and good results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude my brief reply by confirming the commitment given by the Italian Presidency to the European Parliament to report all the developments of the Intergovernmental Conference immediately and to confirm our willingness to take part in focused debates between the Council Presidency and Parliament, this also being a way of ensuring that the best possible results are achieved.</p>

These measures merely safeguard contracts for the large companies and support the concentration of capital, especially when accompanied by measures to cut back the workers' employment and social rights. Pension rights and pension funds are again in the line of fire and the generalisation of ‘flexibility’ in employment and wage freezes are being promoted in the name of competitiveness and reducing labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration and respect for human rights are also in the line of fire. We are seeing coordinated measures to deport, extradite and ‘move on’ immigrants, border guards on land and sea and other measures which offend human dignity and guarantee even greater exploitation of immigrants. And all just a few days after the start of the Intergovernmental Conference which is being called upon to secure capitalism constitutionally, to redistribute power between the powerful and to cede even more national sovereignty to the Euro-unifying centre.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certain that the peoples will not remain inert in the face of the further intensification of the attack and will develop even further their fight to resist and counter attack. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
