We are tabling it because we are concerned about safeguarding our parliamentary prerogatives and the interinstitutional balance laid down in the Treaty. I would remind you that the Commission"s original text provided for a procedure to designate cities of culture based essentially on the quality of the projects put forward. Parliament had amended that text to strengthen the quality requirement even further, particularly by giving the jury greater independence and laying down more precise criteria. It thereby demonstrated its interest in the designation of European cities of culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of working on this basis at second reading, the Council radically changed the original text, providing for the nomination of the European city, for the period from 2005 to 2019, by each country in turn when it assumes the presidency of the Union. The entire procedure set out in the original text is replaced by a rigid system, where the choice of towns is no longer based on project quality but on a mere political decision taken by each state in turn. This system is all the more ridiculous because who knows what Europe will be like in 2015, when Belgium will be able to nominate its European city, or in 2019, when it will be Italy"s turn?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has even forgotten that the enlargement of Europe should presumably take place before 2019 and that, under the system it has decided on, the new members would have no chance of nominating their city unless, pursuing this brilliant line of thought, the Council meets again to organise a rota of the future 11 countries of the European Union from 2020 to 2031. Ladies and gentlemen, this is becoming totally surreal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, by declaring that a text fundamentally different from the original draft is the common position, the Council is hijacking parliamentary procedure. It is preventing Parliament from holding two readings of the text and it is also forcing Parliament to obtain a majority not of the Members present, but of all the Members of Parliament, in other words, a minimum of 314 votes, to adopt any amendments tabled. The Council justifies its attitude on the grounds that, in its view, this was the only way it could obtain unanimity. If that is the case, ladies and gentlemen, it might have realised this much earlier and, if necessary, discussed the problem with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But the main point is that the Council"s difficulties in reaching agreement on a text cannot be used as an excuse for hijacking an institutional procedure. Otherwise, the Council could act in the same way on other issues in the future, allowing a text from first reading that does not correspond to its views to be submitted and then coming up with a totally different common position. In this way, it could bypass Parliament"s second reading and make it impossible for Parliament to properly do its job as co‐legislator. That temptation is obvious. Clearly, we believe it to be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore tabling this declaration of intended rejection to make the Council negotiate in the Conciliation Committee, as provided for by Article 189b(2)(c) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, with two important comments. The first is that the declaration of intended rejection is not aimed at the designation of European cities of culture for the period 2001 to 2004, as those cities were selected through a simple intergovernmental decision. Anyone who makes out that the declaration would affect those cities has not even read the Council"s text. Under the proposed system we have no power as Parliament to discuss the intergovernmental decision. The declaration is only aimed at the common position setting the procedure for choosing from 2005 to 2019, which is the only text we are looking at.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment is that we believe that the European cities are an essential element in the Union"s cultural policy. That is why we believe the cities chosen should receive a sizeable European subsidy. We would like to see an allocation of EUR 2 million per city.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope Parliament will vote for this declaration of intended rejection, thereby demonstrating that it puts the accent on the cultural quality of the projects and that it intends to safeguard the institutional powers it is granted by the Treaty.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">De Coene </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of 1997 the European Commission submitted a proposal to designate European cultural capitals on the basis of an assessment by an independent selection panel, with the Council taking the final decision by qualified majority, after consulting Parliament. Within the space of six months Parliament had an opinion ready on the Commission"s proposal, an opinion that can be summarised as follows: more quality for the cultural programme, greater transparency in the selection of candidate cities and, finally, more money for those cities which are finally designated, with Parliament doing more in its role as co‐decision‐maker at every stage. Then, shortly afterwards, the ministers came up with what is described as a proposal for a common position, a proposal, Commissioner, which took no account either of your initial proposal or of the European Parliament amendments, and under which cities were designated for the period 2001 to 2004. After that, as is well described by the rapporteur, Mr Monfils, we have a kind of rota situation in which cities are designated from 2005 to 2019 each in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only to be expected that we should distance ourselves from this today, if only because this common position totally excludes both the Commission and Parliament from what nevertheless remains a co‐decision procedure. But at the same time we also have problems with a proposal which contains absolutely no guarantee of quality, assumes that all countries in Europe are culturally comparable when, let us be honest about this, some countries probably have more candidates for city of culture than others. As has been said, it also takes no account of Union enlargement or of possible Treaty amendments over the next 20 years, as a result of which Council decisions on cultural matters will no longer have to be unanimous.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to reject the common position, but on the understanding that we approve the towns selected for the period 2001 to 2004. Bruges, Salamanca, Oporto, Rotterdam, Graz, Genoa and Lille must not suffer as a result of a protracted debate between the institutions because the Ministers of Culture have acted so unilaterally. We also want to increase the reference amount to EUR 2 million per designated town, but from 2005 we want to see another system, decided through conciliation. What we want to see – and that is the objective – is a greater guarantee of quality. We want a genuine European dimension, we want large sections of the population to be involved in projects and we want more money for the most appealing cultural project. Let us now work together to reach a genuine compromise which is to everyone"s benefit.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pex </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL) </span> Mr President, as has already been said, the subject of ‘Cultural capital" is an important one for cultural policy and is also very important to our citizens. This is why we must be very careful in the way we deal with it. The rapporteur, Mr Monfils, has submitted an excellent report as a basis for the discussion of the Commission"s proposal and I am also pleased that it has been accepted by Parliament. But I find it a great pity to see how the Council has dealt with the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now when discussing the previous report by Mr Brok, the Commissioner addressed us on the benefits of the Community approach and the disadvantages of the intergovernmental approach. We can add to this the benefits of decision by qualified majority, as the Commission proposed for this subject, as opposed to the unanimity procedure currently being applied by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to state emphatically that this is a matter of law and of principle, and – as Mr Monfils has just said – a very important one at that. That is why I wholeheartedly agree with the proposal he just presented. But I stress that I should also like to limit my remarks on the common position to the period 2005‐2019 and, like previous speakers, that I agree with the candidates for cultural capital for the years 2001‐2004, although the intergovernmental method applied is of course regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Committee on Culture unanimously decided to call for a doubling of the budget, which is also a logical consequence of designating two towns in the stated years. It is important that we enter conciliation with the Council as soon as possible, so that we can use this period in order to try and repair the damage to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from what Mr De Coene said, it must be possible to persuade the Council to accept the key points in Mr Monfils"s proposal and then arrive at an acceptable common position. I hope that this can be done quickly in order to avoid confusion among all those, and there are many of them, who are involved in the ‘Cultural capital" project.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ryynänen </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, Mr Monfils, the rapporteur, has given very clear and strong justifications for rejecting the notion of a common position, so that I will not touch on that issue any further. Instead, I wish to raise a few points concerning the programme itself, a programme I wish every success in the future with the proper level of funding it truly deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the Capital of Culture programme as part of the European Union"s new culture framework programme is a very important and prominent area of common cultural activity, as it inspires and underlines the diverse nature of European cultures. The experience of previous years can teach us a great deal and we also derive enormous benefit from the many successful projects that have taken place. I believe it is most important to achieve a lasting, positive social effect even after the year of the Capital of Culture has ended, and that is why as many of the public as possible should be actively participating in the event, and be given the inspiration to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the Year of Culture will be mainly based on cities" own resources as well as their own particular features, history, and the challenges of change. I believe that this will be the best way of providing a basis for an enriching, international, reciprocal programme. Creating permanent cultural cooperation projects in this way is one of our central aims. Although partnership projects among different cities may add to what is on offer during the year of the Capital of Culture, it is very important that clear responsibility for a project is only that of one city at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">In years gone by the choice of Capital of Culture has been the task – and an agonisingly difficult one – of the Council. Unfortunately, the solution adopted from the year 2000 onwards has been to appoint all nine applicant cities as Capitals of Culture, and thus none will really stand out as ‘the" Capital of Culture. Of all the Member States in the group, only Finland will not have its own Capital of Culture year.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the new proposal each country will have its turn in future, according to a given order. Finland"s turn will come in 2011. The Council will therefore no longer have to do this difficult job. Obviously, the cities themselves must act as proper applicants and take responsibility for their programmes, to ensure a high cultural level.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Daskalaki </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, my group of course supports the report by Mr Monfils, so it also supports the intention to reject the common position on the European Capital of Culture. It has already been said that the Council, ostentatiously ignoring the procedure under way for the adoption of the relevant decision, reached its common position not only without taking Parliament's views into account but also producing a text which differs markedly from the Commission's amended proposal. Furthermore – and this is the height of arrogance and hypocrisy; perhaps that is a harsh thing to say, but that is the way it is – the Council has laid down a list of countries which will be hosting the cultural capital as far ahead as 2019. This grossly undermines the interinstitutional process and shows gross contempt for the European Parliament. That needs no explanation, it is self‐evident, and I think everyone who has spoken so far has said as much in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">With today's proposal the European Parliament's aim is to compel the Council to convene the Conciliation Committee and re‐establish interinstitutional balance. We do not wish to quarrel with the list as decided up to 2004, despite the fact that here too the procedures were rather problematic. But to decide in the same way right up to 2019? That is a period of time as long as the arrogance that led to it is great!</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament insists on playing its proper role. Our group welcomes the fact that these procedures will restore the dialogue rejected unilaterally by the Council on 28 May, so that we can adopt a position either by amending the common position that exists at the moment to redefine the desired criteria of quality and transparency, or indeed by rejecting the common position.</p>

I just want to say this: when European culture is so badly in need of support, how can we possibly allow the Council to sell off, as it were, the institution of the European city of culture? And this is especially of concern when it is doing so as much out of blindness as out of a desire for hegemony.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore entirely agree with our rapporteur"s view and I want to congratulate him both on the quality of his work and on his determination in defending the method of designating this European city, which is a symbol of our cultural vitality.</p>
<p class="contents">I know his position is not entirely understood by all the cities that have already been designated and that are afraid that their project may be forgotten. But I would like them to understand – and I am thinking particularly of the cities of Bruges and Avignon – that they are not involved and, above all, that by defending a genuine interinstitutional balance in the codecision procedure, we are fighting for them as well in order to encourage appreciation of a rich and creative culture. That is also the aim that we are pursuing in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and we do not intend to abandon it.</p>

It is surely a question of whether the city that is awarded the honorary title of European capital of culture can indeed live up to that title. The Council is hiding behind formal arguments and provisions that seem to allow for no other options. The report submitted here is based on substantive arguments that we do not find in the Council"s statements.</p>
<p class="contents">In procedural terms the Council may be right, but that does not produce the best solutions. Since in the final analysis it is a question of culture and therefore of Europe"s reputation, all those involved should agree a procedure that guarantees the right choice of capital of culture.</p>

<p class="contents">We cannot accept the fact that on the one hand applicants for accession are often forgotten and on the other hand Parliament"s codecision right is disregarded. That would create a dangerous precedent. Unfortunately the Council of Ministers for Culture could not reach agreement on the funding of the new cultural programmes, although it agreed in a flash on the designation of capitals of culture, in disregard of the European Parliament"s rights.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall briefly outline the Commission"s position on Parliament"s intended rejection of the Council"s common position on the European City of Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s views on this common position are well known. The common position represents a departure from our original proposal and it has introduced a system of rotation throughout the Member States. Nevertheless, given the importance of this event, what we are now seeking is the application of the codecision procedure, leading, we hope, to agreement between the institutions, so that this action will be viable as soon as possible and have the backing of the whole Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not consider it appropriate to withdraw its initial proposal, even though the basis of the common position certainly does nothing to strengthen the European character of the event. According to our relevant services, the Council"s proposal did not meet the criteria for withdrawal from a legal point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initiative aims to establish a major European cultural event and to ensure it becomes well known. We hope to make the people of Europe better aware of the richness and diversity of each other"s cultural heritage. The introduction of a system of rotation by presidency represents a significant modification to the Commission"s proposal, as the jury of senior independent personalities called to adjudicate on the cultural content of the candidate cities is done away with. Nor is recognition given to Parliament"s role as outlined in the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect for the positions put forward, the Commission has now come to believe that in view of the restrictions imposed by the unanimity rule which we are bound by, the common position adopted by the Council seems the best way forward. It represents the only chance of reaching an agreement and going ahead, on the basis of Community consensus, with an event whose cultural value and importance are readily appreciated by all the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing at this juncture is for Parliament and the Council to engage in open and constructive dialogue, making a final effort to come closer together and reach an agreement guaranteeing the future of this event. This is exactly how I put it to the presidency of the Council yesterday. In the course of yesterday"s meeting between the Commission as a whole and the German Government, I met with Mr Naumann, the Culture Minister, and put this view to him.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is a matter of extreme urgency for the various parties to find a solution as soon as possible, by means of a three‐way dialogue between the Council, Parliament, and, if it would be helpful, the Commission. A way out of the present impasse must be found.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the thoughts I wished to put to you today, though I quite understand your motives for wishing to reject the Council"s common position on the European City of Culture. I strongly encourage you to seek a formula for conciliation, leading to a solution acceptable to all.</p>
