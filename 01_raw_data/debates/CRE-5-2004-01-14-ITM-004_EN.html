<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moraes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I am very proud to be presenting this report today. This report is unique in that it comes from the employment and social affairs side of this House and which for the first time tries the joined-up approach pioneered at the Tampere Summit. I am proud to be presenting it because it joins up the issues of immigration, integration, employment and partnership with third countries: many of the most sensitive issues that we deal with in the European Union, but also issues with which we must deal in a comprehensive way. Very often in this House we have dealt with these issues separately and they have been sensitive separately. Indeed, they are sensitive issues together.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report I have tried to ensure the joined-up approach and have approached the whole task by trying to unify colleagues in this House around some key points. It is a key point that the demographic challenge that we face in the European Union of the future is one where immigration may be one solution, but not the only solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We have some amazing statistics. In the 25 Member States, the working-age population is set to shrink from 303 million to 297 million by 2020, then to 280 million by 2030, almost doubling the old-age dependency ratio. It is the duty of this House to deal with these kinds of statistics. We cannot plan for the future and expect that immigration is not one of those solutions. If immigration is to be a solution, it must be joined up with the vital issue of integration. Integration is often an issue which is misrepresented. It is a vital issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing in this report not just with new immigrants. People coming to the European Union for the first time to work may stay temporarily or they may stay forever. We are dealing in this report in a joined-up way with those ethnic minority communities in the European Union – people like myself and my family – who are settled in the European Union but who also ask Member States for solutions to discrimination to ensure that full integration really takes place. This involves the issues of citizenship requirements, language and a plethora of other issues relating to new immigrant communities, as well as settled ethnic minority communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be proud in this House that for settled ethnic minority communities, we now have – through Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty – anti-discrimination legislation. There is so much in this report to commend to the House; it is difficult to name just one integration measure – there are so many. I urge the House and my colleagues across the House to look very positively at those integration measures for what they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we look at more sensitive issues – for example partnerships between the European Union Member States and developing countries; family unity and immigration – I have also been very sensitive in this report. I have tried to bring together the whole House in agreement that Member States very often have the primary responsibility in these issues but that we should share best practice. That is vital because we are dealing with some issues which we know are politically charged and politically sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The key achievement, I hope, in this report and the key achievement of the Commission communication was not to deal with these issues separately, or to pretend that they could be dealt with separately. It was to take a firm hold on the Tampere agenda, bring it back to this House, use the progress of the Greek presidency which took many of these issues forward, and try to create what I would call a positive agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there will be some problems for some Members in this report. I have tried very hard to bring all parties together because this is a politically sensitive issue. Integration is something that should be the duty of all of us to move forward. For that reason, I realise there are some sticking points. I have done everything I can – for example on paragraph 32 and the right to vote – to bring the House together on these issues. Unfortunately, not all issues will be to the satisfaction of everyone, but I urge colleagues to look at the result of the vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs: 27 votes to 1, with 3 abstentions. There was a general consensus around many of these issues and in the way they were approached. I urge colleagues to vote positively and to think of the people who will be affected by this report, people who we represent: both new migrants who will perhaps become European citizens, but also people like myself who are now European citizens but look to being represented properly in a report which is moderate, comprehensive and should appeal to all sides of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am pleased to be here today to present the main aspects of the Commission communication on immigration, integration and employment, and would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on the excellent quality of his report.</p>
<p class="contents">This very important Commission communication completes our response to the Tampere mandate and fulfils the pledge to examine the role of immigration in relation to the Lisbon strategy. The communication carries two key messages. The first – which has already been expressed in the Commission communication of November 2000 – is that, in the context of demographic ageing and decline, sustained immigration flows are likely and necessary if the European Union is to meet the Lisbon goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the full potential of immigration and its contribution to economic development can only be realised if immigrants are fully integrated both into the labour market and into society in general. Given the estimated speed of population decline from 2010 onwards and the results of the national survey conducted by the Commission, there is an urgent need to strengthen integration policies, as was called for by the European Council in Tampere and more recently at the European Council in Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased that the rapporteur has laid the emphasis on the potential which migrants bring with them. It fully agrees that integration is a matter for society as a whole and that it is a two-way process, based on mutual rights and corresponding obligations, which implies that both the immigrant and the host society must adapt.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that we fully agree that we must ensure a European legal framework for the admission of economic migrants and that Member States must keep to the promises made in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken note of the difficulties encountered when negotiating in the Council the directive on admission for employment purposes, and is currently considering how best to approach bringing forward this politically sensitive issue. A Green Paper, followed by an extensive consultation procedure, is envisaged and we are also undertaking a study on the links between illegal and legal migration, which may provide pointers for the future development of a more coherent legal framework for the admission of migrants for employment purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Adoption of the directive on the admission of researchers is also envisaged for the very near future. Negotiations on the directive on the admission of students is now entering the core phase and I am convinced that this proposal too will shortly be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication considers that, in order to ensure successful integration, there is a need for an holistic approach that takes into account not only economic and social aspects – these are very important – but also issues relating to cultural and religious diversity, civic citizenship, participation and political rights. The Commission is therefore pleased to note the specific attention paid in the report to the concept we put forward of civic citizenship and the need to promote a sense of belonging.</p>
<p class="contents">A key condition for the successful implementation of an holistic approach of this type is that there should be improved overall policy coherence and synergies between immigration, integration and employment policies at all levels and across all disciplines and between all relevant actors, bearing in mind that prime responsibility for successful integration ultimately lies with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that I fully agree with, and welcome, the rapporteur's suggestion to establish programmes for the initial reception of persons arriving in an EU Member State. We are currently implementing the pilot projects in support of the integration of migrants. There has been enormous interest in these pilot projects and the programme has been oversubscribed to a factor of ten. We allocated EUR 4 million and applications have been made for more than EUR 41 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by saying that I believe, and hope, that this communication on immigration, integration and employment will provide a basis for strengthening integration policy for immigrants, which will be crucial both for the development of the EU economy and for the promotion of social cohesion in the next few decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The speech by Mr Vitorino and the report by Mr Moraes both seem to me to be fully acceptable, in view of the opinion adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which underlines the following points: the Council’s delay in adopting the legislative instruments presented by the Commission to implement the Tampere programme, a delay which, fortunately, was partly made up for in December with the adoption of the important directive on long-term residents; the need to retain a global view of immigration policy linked to employment policy and social integration policy; the usefulness of agreements with the countries of origin in order to guarantee the transfer of social security entitlements; the need to combat illegal immigration with repressive measures directed not against the illegal immigrants but against the traffickers who profit from them, and to combat illegal employment without discriminating against immigrant citizens; the usefulness of facilitating legal access for immigrants to the labour market so as to reduce demand and supply on the hidden market; the suitability of fighting discrimination and paying particular attention to the precarious situation of immigrant women.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion underlines in particular the usefulness of creating the form of citizenship known as ‘civic citizenship’, which enables third country nationals legally resident in the European Union to have economic, social and political rights and duties, including the right to vote in local and European elections, as the European Parliament has often requested. Only in this way will all workers and residents be able to feel that they are participants and jointly responsible for the future of the Community, sharing its values and contributing to its growth and to living together in peace and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are controversial subjects in all the nation states, but it is high time we obtained analyses of the problems and challenges and proposals for common European solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should next like to congratulate Mr Moraes on the report. It is a particularly relevant and necessary report right now. I am grateful for Mr Moraes’ having integrated the opinions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on the need to apply a gender perspective to immigration and integration policy. If this is not perceived as discriminatory, I also believe that this is due to Mr Moraes' particular background.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to succeed in creating a successful immigration and integration policy at European level too, it is absolutely necessary for a gender perspective to be applied at all levels. That is something of which I should like to remind the combined Commission once again. I am aware that Mrs Diamantopoulou and her Directorate-General are working hard on this, but it is necessary for you, Mr Vitorino, as her colleague, to do so too. Quite honestly, I find it just a little bit wearisome having to go on picking up the pieces of the Commission’s initiatives and ploughing the same old furrows.</p>
<p class="contents">The headscarf debate is in full swing in many places in Europe at the moment. Should we not, however, be looking, rather, at a number of other areas such as better integration, the ways in which we enter into dialogue and the ways in which we give the women concerned power over their own lives. It might then be that the headscarf debate would solve itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that immigrant women who, as such, are bearers of a culture also be given opportunities without being totally disowned by their families because they want both to embrace their own culture and a European attitude of gender equality in society. If the women are not integrated, there is a danger of their sons or daughters not being so either and of their, in that way, being stuck in outdated gender roles which, in the Europe of today, are of no use in terms either of family life or of the labour market. Think of the emphasis that is now being placed upon the need today also for male managers to be able to incorporate feminine values into their management styles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are also other facets to this problem, amongst which we should certainly examine the issues of entry, housing and civil liberties; in short, integration into our European society. I believe it is a question, in this case at least, of turning these guest workers into citizens. What image of Europe are we projecting to the outside world, Commissioner, if, at the point of entry into the Union, the Schengen system, instead of helping to create an area of freedom, security and justice, is often gradually turning into a formidable instrument of electronic data collection and control?</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the problems of housing, the head-in-the-sand attitude, the tendency – helped by the media – to focus our fears and turn them into spectres that have much to do with highly misunderstood aspects of the cultural identity of our societies. Thus we often have a reductionist image. The report, with which I fully agree, should perhaps in my opinion have developed certain aspects which are plainly set out in the Commission’s communication: civic citizenship; guaranteed core rights and obligations; respect for diversity; action to combat discrimination; women; family; civic, cultural and political life; participation; education; and, not least, religion.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these varied aspects have to be taken into account, particularly in view of the legal tradition and the humanistic values which form the heritage that is still shared by our society. Commissioner, Mr Moraes, we must reject the reductionist tendency of seeing immigrants merely as man- or woman-power, from a purely economic point of view. This attitude must be utterly rejected: these people must be regarded as human beings who enrich our society, not just in terms of their ability to create growth and well-being but above all as people who embody values and a human, spiritual and cultural identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, on his efforts and the good work he has done on a report on immigration, integration and employment, which I believe deserves to be viewed favourably. These are issues that provide fertile ground for personal feelings and opinions, as well as for political temptations, and for that reason I wish to refer to the content of the Communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration is a reality that needs to be regulated, and we must not bury our heads in the sand or look the other way. In Europe, particularly in the countries with the lowest birth rate (Spain and Italy, amongst others), immigration is a necessary remedy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the estimated population of the European Union of 25, as the rapporteur has said, is going to drop from 303 million to 297 million by 2020 and to continue to drop to 280 million in accordance with the estimate for 2030, the reduction in employment could have negative effects on economic growth, given that growth results from increased employment and productivity. For this very reason, immigration must not be seen as a problem, but as an opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is of course an opportunity, however, that raises certain problems which we must resolve. Without being exhaustive, I would point out the problem of the integration of foreign children, children of immigrants, into schools; that of inter-cultural coexistence in communities and workplaces; that of family reunification, with all the problems raised by the very concept of reunification in a broad sense or in a narrow sense; of the regulation of people without documentation; the fight against illegal immigration and the mafias which exploit it; in particular, the problem of the specific situation of women immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, immigrants are necessary, but how many can we accept? Everybody who wants to come? I think that is impossible. It would be like transferring the problems of the countries of the immigrants are trying to leave to some of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that in the countries with very low birth rates, without immigration, the ratio between active and passive workers would become unsustainable in the medium term, I believe that the best approach is to integrate them. They represent workforce, but, above all, they are human beings who the Member States need. The Tampere proposals are therefore still valid: cooperation with countries of origin, a common European asylum system, management of migratory flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">For those who each State can legally receive and with a view to their integration, I believe that the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights offers us the course to follow in its Articles 4, 5 and 14, or, which comes to the same thing, the prohibition of inhumane or degrading treatment; the prohibition of forced labour and the right to education.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are placing considerable emphasis on the idea of employment, more specifically, Article 15 states that the third-country nationals authorised to work in the territory of the Member States have the right to the same conditions as nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 20 lays down equality for people before the law. Article 21 prohibits all discrimination on other grounds, including on grounds of nationality; Article 23 guarantees equality between men and women in all areas, including employment, work and pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Moraes describes situations and proposes measures which are generally acceptable in view of the situation of immigrants who are frequently disadvantaged in terms of pay, health and safety conditions at work, hours and illegal employment. In summary, often, in more cases than we would like, and we would like there to be no such cases, we are talking about exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">We said that the first means of integration was employment, naturally followed by cultural integration, but we must not forget that Article 1 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights tells us that, ‘Human dignity is inviolable. It must be protected and respected’, and talks about the dignity of all human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Moraes report has remained precisely within the spirit and letter of the decisions taken at Tampere, expressly calling for a more dynamic policy to integrate immigrants, in the aim of granting rights and obligations similar to those which apply to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, immigration policy cannot mean just guarding borders, it cannot only be identified with repressive measures, repatriation and readmission. The Europe of human rights and the Rule of Law needs to recognise the basic labour and political rights of immigrants, to recognise what they have to offer, their valuable contribution to the economic development of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, social integration makes no sense without recognition of political rights and obligations, in other words the right to vote and to be elected. I think that a huge moral issue is in the making with the position of numerous conservative Members, who gladly accept the exploitation of the manpower of immigrants, especially in jobs which Europeans have abandoned, and at the same time see them as a solution to the demographic problem, but who say nothing about recognising their political rights. Equally immoral is the stance of those who, with opportunistic and expedient positions and practices, feed xenophobia and racism in Europe in an endeavour to raise new Berlin walls in people's minds and conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last ten years, my political group has been fighting for a more humanitarian approach to the problems caused by large waves of immigrants and refugees and we are fighting for a pluralist and multicultural Europe, for unity within our differences, where everyone will have their place and rights without discrimination and without notional walls between us.</p>
<p class="contents">European integration, social cohesion and the Lisbon strategy will be unattainable objectives, as you too stressed Commissioner, without the full safeguarding and application of all the human and political rights which European governments have promised to guarantee. I should like to express my satisfaction, because I heard Mr Ahern this morning confirming that the promotion of human rights is one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency. Only if their rights are respected will people of different origins and cultures feel part of the society in which they legally live and work, bearers of rights and obligations with their say on their everyday life, work, education, language learning, housing, health services, social services, their cultural environment and their political activities. Parliament has repeatedly proposed full recognition of the political rights of anyone who has been resident in the European Union for five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also be obliged, Mr President, if you would allow me, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to call for something which is missing from the Commission communication: the integration of the gender aspect in all policies relating to immigrants' rights. Women are the most vulnerable group and often the first victims of economic and sexual exploitation. That is why special measures need to be taken to combat discrimination and facilitate their integration into social and professional life. Such measures might be vocational training, childcare facilities, individualisation of their rights, counselling, specialist research etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such difficulties become even more important when the change in linguistic and cultural context is a major one. Yet history tells us too just how mutually beneficial migration may be, provided that it is appropriately managed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Moraes Report tackles the issues in a way that is at once realistic, sensitive and robust. It makes practical suggestions. Experience in Canada has already shown a number of these to be effective in achieving desired outcomes. I am particularly grateful for the extent to which the report identifies problems for migrant women and measures to assist in resolving these.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking too on behalf of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak. Unfortunately she cannot be here today, but she would like me to express her thanks for the support that her amendments received in committee. We rather regret that, given the degree of consensus the report achieved there, it has been opened up for amendments in plenary. That said, we can support the majority of them, either in whole or in part. We particularly support Amendment No 10, which makes the report more positive to enlargement, and Amendments Nos 7 and 12 on family reunification. We do, however, have major difficulties with Amendment No 4, which backtracks on the commitment already made in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Mr Moraes for the work he has done to produce such a worthwhile report and express the hope that it gets the support it so much deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, however, that the image of Fortress Europe that the European Union has generated, as a result of its profoundly restrictive immigration policies, stands in stark contrast to the real economic need for immigrant labour.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why this Commission proposal presents immigration as part of the solution to the ageing of Europe’s population and to the decline in its active population. I deplore the fact that the Commission attaches greater importance to the economic and demographic aspects that lead to immigration than to the social and human aspects or to improving the living and working conditions of immigrants in the various countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings cannot result in a repressive policy that targets illegal immigrants. It must instead target the traffickers and employers who exploit this situation. This is why we have presented a set of what we believe to be important proposals to improve the Moraes report, in the hope that they will be adopted. These include opposing the content of the Council directive on family reunification, which contravenes the fundamental right to live in a family and contains an unacceptable proposal to subject all immigrant children of at least two years of age to a test, before deciding whether they can join their parents. I would also highlight our appeal to Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, adopted by United Nations General Assembly Resolution No 45158 of 18 December 1990. In addition, however, the overwhelming majority of immigrant workers who do not have residence permits but who do pay taxes and social security contributions in their host country should be automatically legalised. We also hope that account is taken of the fact that the overwhelming majority of immigrants are citizens of third countries who emigrate to European Union countries to flee situations of extreme poverty in their country of origin and who must, therefore, be treated as victims and not as potential criminals. Lastly, I am sorry that the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats seeks to use the Moraes report to call into question established political rights, specifically the right of immigrant workers to vote in local elections to the European Parliament. Immigrants must not be viewed as disposable workers who can be thrown away after use. Immigrants, and women in particular, should be deemed worthy of reception conditions that respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and equal economic, social and cultural rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Part of the problem that we see in the European Union is that certain Member States now see themselves moving from countries of emigration to countries of migration, and other countries are coming face to face with the fact that they have made a very bad job in terms of using the talents and skills of many long-term migrants and, indeed, second and third generation nationals, as they are now in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In an ideal world migration should be a matter of free choice, not forced by circumstance, so we welcome the recognition in this report of the need to reduce the causes of forced migration. Whether people wish, by choice, to come and help us out with out labour shortages and our demographic problems will depend on the circumstances of their welcome and the treatment that they receive here when they are resident. I welcome Mr Pérez Álvarez's reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the positive position of many other speakers this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of issues concerning, in particular, the labour market and equal treatment, which form part of this will to come and work in the European Union. The Article 13 directives tackling the racism and discrimination faced by many migrant workers are extremely important, as are the issues surrounding access to the market itself and equal pay and working conditions – rather than the exploitation of cheap migrant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is evidence in quite a number of European countries that certain industries rely very heavily on migrant workers whose status is often in doubt. We need to be very careful that the demands of our economy do not encourage the proliferation of poor working practices and the trafficking of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of civic citizenship, we very much agree with that as it stands in the report. We support the current text, including voting rights. The UK experience, for example, is that a number of our local councils benefit greatly from the representation of first generation migrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important that he emphasised that this issue is within the competence of the Member States and that it is through cooperation and coordination, rather than direction and enforcement of individual acts of legislation, that the best results can be achieved. We are all presented with a common challenge on how best to manage migration flows and integration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union are on the threshold of our largest enlargement ever, when we open our doors to ten new countries and ensure that this European Union can continue to give benefit to the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe. They have suffered for so long from lack of opportunity, lack of economic development and lack of political freedom and skills. We are also, as the Irish presidency announced today, emphasising the Lisbon Process to make Europe work to ensure that the people who get jobs get proper returns and protection for the jobs they are in.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the point which many Members have already discussed here today, that is, how best we ensure that those who are emigrating into the European Union are given the protection and opportunities to benefit from any economic growth or any social rights that are there.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an immediate process. This cannot happen all at once. Demographic changes are taking place in the Union at the present time which require us to get people from elsewhere. This idea of managed migration is an important response to the demographic and economic changes which are taking place. It is only by our acting in cooperation and coordination with those third countries – and I am delighted that the rapporteur was able to take on board my amendment on this – that we can ensure there is no cherry-picking of the best individuals from those third countries, that there is not a brain drain and that there is also benefit to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite what some Members may say in this Chamber here today, this is not an open door policy and should not be an open door policy. We have seen that where there is a lack of controls and where there is a lack of decision-making within Member States, we have problems with regard to racism. Most individuals fear change that occurs on a massive scale.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to women's issues, particularly protection for women who are illegally trafficked, each of us has a responsibility to stamp this out wherever it takes place. Wherever the illegal exploitation of immigrant workers takes place, it should be stamped out, highlighted and individuals should be named and shamed for the very negative impact it has.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that tonight we will be discussing the employment and service sector, which is linked to this issue of protecting individuals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the whole, I can endorse the report by Mr Moraes. I should, however, like to draw attention to the connection between the three vital issues that the rapporteur mentions in recital 1: the need for migration to the European Union, improved integration, and cooperation with countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I do not see that migration to the European Union is needed as a result of the ageing of the population. Whilst there are still labour reserves in the European Union, at all events, the recruitment of migrant workers cannot constitute a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the second issue, too. It is true that we need improvements in integration. In the Netherlands, the debate on this is in full swing. However, as the rapporteur rightly says, integration is connected with a whole range of domestic factors. Examples are the social context, education and command of the language. Precisely because of this observation, a European policy cannot be effective, and labour migration and integration should be a national priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 28 calls for attention to the problems that can be an issue in the field of general and reproductive health. I recognise the need for this. I must emphasise, however, that the promotion of abortion is out of the question. I should be pleased to hear what the rapporteur was aiming at with this section. I am also of the opinion that extending the definition of ‘family’ in this context would not be conducive to the promotion of integration. This would increase the problem of integration instead of solving it. These comments do not detract from the need for cooperation with countries of origin, however, or for consultations among the Member States of the European Union. The need to improve the situation of immigrants and their place in the labour market is clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, migratory flows are not an inescapable reality, as the rapporteur says. Just because he and his political allies want it does not mean that immigration is an inescapable disaster. On the contrary, until further notice, Member States still have the right to determine for themselves who enters the country, when and under what conditions. Also, the fact that most governments are extremely lax in applying their own immigration and integration legislation does not mean that the population is in agreement. For example, there is by no means a popular democratic majority in favour of foreign nationals having the right to vote or in favour of new waves of immigration, as the report argues.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, as democrats, there can be no harm in stopping to think about this and taking it into consideration. After all, what legitimacy does a European Union have that takes decisions that are diametrically opposed to the will of the people? The discussion on rights without obligations that unfortunately also finds expression in this report, has had its day. It has been superseded, and it is urgently in need of comprehensive evaluation. In the Netherlands, for example, a commission of inquiry has been set up to look into the current integration policy, and two governing parties have already come to the conclusion that the policy of cosseting has been a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not say a single word about the socio-economic or social problems that currently exist. In Flanders, for example, unemployment among people of North African origin is four to five times that of the indigenous population, in relative terms, so that the question arises as to who actually has an interest in a new form of immigration. Also, what about the indigenous people who no longer feel at home in their own town, their own street, as it is? What about the rise of Islam and the deliberate unwillingness to integrate? None of this is mentioned, and therefore this report is, I fear, yet another waste of time and resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time that Europe stopped focusing exclusively on ways to limit flows of refugees and started making positive noises for once. Positive noises are necessary, because we already have a great many migrants in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The last speaker rightly pointed out the extremely high unemployment among migrants. Looking at the EU figures for 2002, I see that the unemployment rate among citizens of the European Union is 7.1%, but is more than double that for non-EU citizens living in the EU: almost 16%. If I then look at my own country, the figure is 33.5%. That means that a third of immigrants are out of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the government of those countries – and here it is not my intention to enter into controversy, but I should just like to say it, because the other side frequently enters into controversy – I see that countries with a left-wing government are by no means doing any better than those with a right-wing government. Incidentally, the same goes for the right to vote. I am always dumbfounded by the ideology that some people propagate in this Parliament, whilst in their own country, where they hold administrative power, they are unable to translate that same ideology into policy. The right to vote is not granted in any of those countries: you can put it in your memoranda or your documents as much as you want, but your governments do not want to grant the right to vote and nor do your parties. It is very easy, therefore, to come here and advocate it, no strings attached. I say this because I have tried, in a moderate way, to ensure that reference is made in the text to political rights without making a direct link with the right to vote. That is evidently still not enough for a large number of people whose countries have left-wing governments, although they cannot push it through in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I now speaking specifically about employment? I am doing so because work is the best means of integration. All the rest follows from this. I think that the European Union and our countries are paying too little attention to this. Those with a job have an income, can seek better accommodation and usually obtain legal status. They learn the language at work and can put their children through the education system in these countries in the normal way. Work is thus one of the most important possibilities for integration. Sadly, we note that the European Union is defaulting in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the solution that is being proposed for the future, that is to say, that we manage migration on the basis of the work we are able to offer. That implies, of course, also giving the present migrants work and gearing this management not only towards future migrants. Looking at the EU figures, much remains to be done in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw attention to another point. When it comes to highly qualified migrants – and here I am not especially talking about migrants from African countries, but those from the United States, for example – we never ask that they speak our language, because they end up in companies where the language of communication is English. That is so easy: it is assumed that highly trained people will know the language of the company. We make a great many requirements of less-skilled workers – soon they will have to take exams, too – making things very difficult for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without doubt, there is a lot of xenophobia and racism in our societies or, in any case, a fear of that which comes from outside. There is extensive mistrust. It is believed that people from other countries will come and take our jobs when, in reality, the situation is quite the opposite. Those who come from other countries have, to the greatest degree, contributed, and go on contributing, to the prosperity we enjoy. I can speak from my own experience. I was born after the war and grew up on a housing estate whose residents mainly came from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. Approximately half of my neighbours had arrived as immigrants from other countries. They contributed to Swedish prosperity, just like everyone else. We should not have had the prosperity we enjoy today if these people, together with the rest of us, had not contributed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in another position. We have, firstly, a refugee policy and, secondly, an immigration policy. We must develop the refugee policy together, and it must be based upon international conventions. Europe must be a refuge for people being persecuted and in danger of being killed in other countries. We must have a humane refugee policy for which we take joint responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration policy is something else. It concerns people who are not in danger of being killed in their own countries but who would like to come to Europe, both to obtain a better life for themselves and to contribute to our societies, as they, in actual fact, do. It is something they do already, and there will be a greater need for them to do so in the future. We know how demographic developments look, and we need growth, employment and prosperity in Europe. We need to increase employment in the future, and we need people to employ if we are to be able to cope with health care and the care of the elderly. We need people, including people from other countries, together with those who are already here. Unfortunately, the fact is that people who at present come from other countries become, in large measure, unemployed, and that is something we naturally should do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we need an immigration policy. Immigrants must be integrated as soon as possible. Integration policy is important, and employment comes with education. That applies especially to women, as Mrs Dybkjaer mentioned. It is important both for women’s own sake and in order that the next generation might be integrated into society.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say one thing about the issue that has created some kerfuffle, namely voting rights. I have experience of the euro vote in Sweden where we applied the same rules as in local elections; that is to say, people from other countries were allowed to vote. They went to the polls in very large numbers. If they had been able to decide the outcome of the Swedish vote, Sweden would today have had the euro as a currency. They were supporters of the euro and were more European than other Swedes. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will say, however and I do not say this to reproach Mr Moraes, or as a 'turf' issue that it is a sad comment on the perceived definition of justice and home affairs in the EU institutions – that is, law enforcement and tough borders – that it is the social affairs side which is given the full lead on issues of citizenship and non-discrimination. We must place these human rights issues within the justice framework, as well as the social policy framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The insistence on local and European voting rights for legal immigrants is a key issue. How can we possibly expect them to integrate if they are denied civic and political participation? An active approach to integration is overdue. The controversies over the wearing of the <span class="italic">hijab</span>, the Muslim headscarf – or <span class="italic">la voile</span>, as the French rather confusingly say – show how acute the arguments can be. The fascinating difference between, for example, French and British attitudes shows that there is no one definition of integration. What we should be clear about is that it does not mean assimilation. Integration is surely a two-way street in which all parties have to adjust to a dynamic and changing society. It is not a soft option; hard effort is needed not only from immigrants themselves – such as language learning and equality – but also from indigenous communities in accepting and learning from differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope all of us here and I know Mr Moraes does his best will try to persuade our national governments to stop populist and mean measures that only collude with media hysteria. For instance, if asylum seekers were allowed to work, they could escape the jibe of being welfare scroungers, which is unfairly thrown at them and which gives such a bad start to their eventual integration if they get legal status. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is how US power was built. France, Great Britain and other countries would not have developed without the contribution of immigrants from their colonial empires or from poorer countries of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the slave trade, these population movements were free; migrants were not chained or whipped. The hunger and poverty of their places of origin were enough to drive them to emigrate. Where that emigration was regulated, it was done to serve the interests of the capitalist enterprises, in other words, the big employers of the host country. In other words, this report is not dazzling in its originality. True, it proposes that modern wage slaves should be well integrated, and it even proposes positive measures for women, but their main purpose is to control them and adapt them to the needs of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new in this report, on the other hand, is the proposal for temporary immigration, which will allow big western capital to benefit from a workforce already trained elsewhere and therefore trained free of charge and to get rid of it once it thinks it no longer needs it. Well, that is an inhuman system because it is the market that decides instead of people and that situation will continue so long as the present economic system exists.</p>
<p class="contents">What, however, the workers can and must be given in order to safeguard their collective interests, whether they are citizens or migrants, is a strict equality of rights so that the employers cannot set one against the other by introducing a competition that will be harmful to all. That is why we are calling for complete equality of civil and political rights for all who live and work on the Union’s soil, including the right to move freely, to leave and to return. We call, moreover, for the legalisation of the situation of all so-called illegal immigrant workers, who are only illegal because the authorities refuse to grant them papers.</p>

In this case the good intentions are to move the integration issue forward along the lines laid down at the Tampere European Council. The report thus contains statements of intent that certainly make good sense, for instance when it suggests that the all too common and uncontrolled illegal employment of illegal and hidden immigrants is a direct incentive to illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It then goes so far as to state, however, in these very words, that the current political climate regarding asylum and illegal immigration may be – just think of it! – a possible obstacle to creating cooperation on managed migration and integration policies. This is clearly a contradiction, which can only be accounted for by a highly ideological view of the migration issue, and we have had some pretty obvious examples of this in earlier speeches. This view can only lead to statements that lack any objectivity and any connection with reality, as for instance when the idea is put forward that combating illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings results in a repressive policy against immigrants. If anything, it is this partisan, ideological, misleading view that may lead to the distortion of the increasingly clear and well-defined objectives that have recently been identified and pursued by the European Union, especially during the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree with a view of civil citizenship that includes the right to vote in local and even European elections, through which the European Union should somehow take the place of the individual Member States in recognising one of the rights – the right to be part of the electorate – on which, in my opinion, in a true democracy only the people of Europe, and not the internationalist bureaucratic and technocratic superpower, can decide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are dealing with the important issue of determining the reception capacity of the Member States according to the needs of their labour markets, and we are doing so from two points of view: quantitative and qualitative. It is therefore crucial for governments to make realistic offers which are as far as possible in line with available jobs, temporary or permanent, which can be filled by means of migratory flows, which ultimately have the effect of balancing the European Union's demographic deficit. This would be of benefit to the Member States and the immigrants’ countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the problem is currently arising – with tragic results in many cases, as we are seeing – of the emergence of a hidden economy in sectors such as agriculture, domestic service and construction; an economy which is fed partly by illegal immigration and which leads to subhuman situations and conditions both from a strictly employment point of view and from a social point of view. This leads to the establishment of ghettos and communities which are entirely fragmented and that face serious problems in surviving in the host countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Commissioner, Mr President, we can spend every day holding seminars and meetings, and applying all our attention to multiculturalism and integration from a religious point of view, and other issues, which lead us nowhere unless we establish crystal clear conditions for legal and ordered entry which guarantee immigrants a job in the European Union and facilitate their reception and social, cultural and political integration. In short, Mr President, from a human point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the political aspect of integration, which has been subject to much debate today, I believe that our Group’s Amendment No 4 must be given particular attention by the other political groups. For example, how can we ask for the right to vote in European elections for immigrants residing legally – I imagine – in the Union, when they cannot vote, for logical and constitutional reasons, in the legislative elections of the State they live in? That is, they cannot elect the governments of the Member States but they can elect that of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen of the Left, allow me to say that this is a crazy proposal, and that the Groups supporting it must seriously reconsider. On voting issues, ladies and gentlemen of the Left, there must be no room for demagoguery.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we can do nothing if we restrict ourselves to wishing to resolve this problem by making the European Union solely responsible, without demanding that countries of origin co-operate very actively in the ordered flow of their own immigrants, which would mean these countries having the necessary administrative structures to organise their migratory flows, also making it more attractive for their own workers to return and, naturally, preventing mass exoduses, as is currently the case in certain border countries or, also – let us not forget – from countries on the other side of the Atlantic, as a result of their economic, political and social instability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the birth rate is continuing to decline, while the number of pensioners increases, it is probable that there will be adverse effects, and not only on economic growth. Will increased immigration from third countries help here? Which workers to accept is for the Member States to decide, and that is also in the interests of the countries from which they come, who often lose significant potential. Controlled immigration makes it possible to see who is coming onto the labour markets. There must be great sensitivity in approximating conditions of entry at EU level, and this must be done only progressively, using together tried and tested procedures in recruitment and admissions policies, as is stated in one of the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. On this I am in absolute agreement with Mr Hernández Mollar. There is a need for dialogue with the social partners, as well as with the authorities that are responsible for the local labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must act with far more agreement and far greater decisiveness if legitimate employment is to be permitted and illegal employment prevented. The fact is that the latter compels many workers to accept intolerable pay and living conditions. Immigration alone, of course, will not safeguard our social security systems. If, for example, there is to be any marked increase in the birth rate, both mothers and fathers need far better legal safeguards. All in all, we all need society to be more family-friendly. Better-qualified workers and an increase in the number of jobs are dependent on the labour markets and the education and training systems being reformed. Although our rapporteur, Mr Moraes, was willing to find consensus, and incorporated many of my amendments into compromises that promise to gain majorities, the new amendments originating from our PPE-DE Group appear not to be supported by a majority in his own group.</p>
<p class="contents">As a number of Members have said, one key point is that each Member State is itself responsible for making its own local election rules. That must continue to be the case in future. Only citizens of the EU may vote in the elections to the European Parliament. Let us beware of eccentricities that amount to defamation. If there is no support for this position, some of us will find it very difficult to vote for the report as a whole.</p>

It is customary practice to do this anyway, but I think that it is particularly fitting in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason is that the rapporteur has really tried to concern himself in particular with the position of migrants in the labour market. I believe that he has succeeded in this, but unfortunately not entirely, because others have presented all kinds of distracting amendments. I should like to mention Amendment No 13 in particular, which more or less states that anyone who has paid even a small amount of tax anywhere should have an automatic right to a residence permit. I think that it is impossible to speak about any part of this topic without taking as one’s point of departure that Europe, with 450 million inhabitants, cannot be a reception centre for ten times as many people living outside Europe. That is not possible, and if we refuse to accept this fact, things become very difficult. The rapporteur has of course accepted it, and hence speaks about ‘managing migration’. That automatically implies doing something about it, keeping the situation in hand. I think that that is very good, in itself. If people keep to it, this is a splendid report. I have a fundamental difference of opinion, therefore, with those behind me who have said that it is nothing but nonsense and flights of fancy. That is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">The dangerous flights of fancy are to be found on the other side of this House, where people are seeking to grant rights that cannot be fulfilled. If we cannot provide employment, there is no sense in granting rights. This would make us like the rich people of old who had a beautiful view from their windows and cared nothing that the poor people had to live in slums, because that is where they went, after all. Anyone who wants that should say so. They must also come out and say that we should indeed take in everyone and only then look at the consequences. That is the problem that we have here in the background.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has shown that he is aware of that. He has also shown that he is trying to prevent that. Unfortunately, however, there are still some people in his own party – and in some other parties – who copy those aristocrats of old who believed that everyone should simply be given rights but who were not themselves prepared to accept the logical consequences of this and, instead, left others to deal with them. That exacerbates the misery, as we can see in the United States, and we want to avoid that. There is absolutely no need for any talk of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of European citizenship, the rules on this are laid down in the Treaty, and it is indeed strange to include this subject here in a couple of words. That would need a Treaty amendment. We have, however, declared ourselves in agreement with the Convention, which does not provide for this. It would be very strange, then, if we were to simply go and lay down rules on the subject here in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council laid the foundations for immigration policy in the Union. Today, more than ever, greater priority must be attached to this issue, mainly due to the significant increase in the flow of immigrants to Europe in recent years, to the need to maintain Europe’s level of economic development given the growing demographic deficit, to the shrinking labour force and to enlargement and the changes to the dynamics of migration that this will bring.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of illustration, Italy will need an annual influx of more than 6500 immigrants per million inhabitants, according to the United Nations. My country, Portugal, currently receives 400 000 immigrants, which represents 8% of the working population and in the next 50 years could see a 17% fall in its total population. Immigrants, therefore, represent a resource for the labour market. This is not their only purpose, however. Their rights cannot be separated from fundamental human rights. Each Member State must consequently, in coordination with the Union, set limits for migratory flows that match the needs of their labour markets and also provide a supportive, humane and integrated response to receiving those who seek us out in order to improve their living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States, therefore, face a common challenge; that of improving the management of migratory flows by improving integration policies towards new and established migrants, in an ongoing partnership with the countries of origin. Lastly, as regards the rights associated with citizenship, which must always be considered in this matter, we take the view that it would be premature and possibly going too far to grant immigrants the right to vote in European elections. Even in local elections, each Member State must retain the prerogative as to whether or not it gives its immigrants the right to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the new demographic challenges that the European Union will have to confront in a few years’ time, the Commission and the rapporteur are right to present immigration as part, but only part, of the answer for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the economic and social consequences of the ageing of the population, it is clear today that managed immigration will without a doubt avoid a slowing down in economic growth and a decline in our fellow citizens’ quality of life. However, I doubt that such managed immigration can take place, because obviously everyone aspires to a change of scenery and a better standard of living. Moreover, we sometimes encourage such flows by our votes; I am thinking in particular of Mrs Lambert’s report, report 1481, which extends our entire social security system to refugees and immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, we need a number of measures to facilitate and improve the reception and integration of aliens without penalising either the host country or the aliens who are moving lawfully on the territory of the European Union. One of the necessary conditions for successful integration is that immigrants should have access to the European Union’s employment market and we are all agreed on that.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me premature, however, in the context of a report on employment and integration, to give third country nationals the right to vote in local and European elections. As my fellow Member, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, said, how can we imagine third country nationals voting in European elections when they do not have the right to vote in general elections in our countries? As for local elections, each of the Union’s 15 countries currently has its own practice in the matter of voting rights – nationality based on parentage or place of birth – and it is unthinkable today to imagine that the same legislation could be applied to all 15 countries of the Union by a vote taken so stealthily.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I shall be voting for Amendment No 4, which notes that third country nationals have the right to vote in local elections in some countries but does not oblige the other Member States to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The dynamics of immigration in the European Union should be seen as part of a framework that takes account of the benefits this brings to all the parties involved. The Irish Presidency also mentioned this point this morning. Migratory flows must be managed so that they serve the interests of both the host country and the country of origin. Management of these flows may in fact be a response, as has already been said, to the democratic and economic development of the Union. We now need to improve the integration of the immigrants – legal immigrants – who represent a resource, but the immigrant populations must in turn respect the fundamental values of their host countries. A proposal has been mentioned to guarantee citizens of third countries legally residing in the Union the opportunity to vote in local and European elections. It is clear to everyone that such a question should remain a matter of the strictest subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur in particular for the compromise reached with the Member State governments on setting up a quota system for legal entry into their countries, and thus into Europe, to be offered to the countries of origin and of transit as one of the main incentives for negotiation and agreement on readmission. It is very important to get this kind of collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, this complex issue, together with preparation of policy on the management of migratory flows, must obviously be dealt with at European level as quickly as possible. The rights of migrants must be recognised, but only alongside a policy to regulate these flows, which has to be a strict one.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Italy has the second highest number of immigrants in Europe and is the only country in Europe to have very long external borders to the east and to the south. The whole of Europe must take stock of the size and complexity of this enormous migratory and social pressure, because the real problem starts in Italy but is immediately and automatically transferred to all the other Community countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are seeing an increase in illegal migratory flows, generally controlled by criminal networks that give misleading information to potential migrants, who end up forced to work in conditions completely different to those they were promised, which might even include physical and or mental abuse and breaches of their human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, therefore, an extremely welcome initiative and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moraes, because he provides a balanced analysis of three fundamental and interlinked issues. Firstly, managing migratory flows. We must have a common immigration policy with common conditions and rules for the entry and residence of migrant workers, which must always take account of each Member State’s real labour and economic needs. It must be left to each Member State to assess and to decide whether it should increase its labour force, in what quantity, in what sector, bearing in mind its real needs and its capacity to receive and integrate these immigrants. We must fight against illegal migratory flows, allowing economic migrants to take advantage of clearly defined and transparent legal channels, in order to compensate for possible labour shortages in each Member State. The proposal for a directive on the admission of third country nationals for the purpose of employment must help to explain to potential immigrants the legal ways of obtaining the right to reside in the Union. It must also strengthen the fight against illegal employment and penalise in particular those that profit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, improving the integration of immigrants into the European Union. There must be a common approach that ensures the integration of third-country nationals into our societies, guaranteeing rights and obligations as regards residency, access to education and employment and ensuring that they are not subject to discrimination at the economic, social and cultural levels.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point concerns the need for cooperation with the countries of origin, in order to increase their capacity for managing migration, which will also require agreements to be negotiated on readmission and programmes to aid return. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Emigrating has always been a necessity and often a hope, but seldom a choice. I say this as I come from a country that has had first-hand experience of the emigration problem for a great many decades. In recent years the subject of migration into many European countries has taken on bitter and often dramatic connotations. I believe it is both necessary and useful for the various Member States to share a common position on this subject, because I cannot envisage any positive scenarios unless they are regulated by all the countries in the Union. I also think, however, that this is one of the most sensitive issues, one of those issues that, more than any other perhaps, needs to be managed; and managing it means addressing matters of visas, employment, health, citizens’ rights and duties, and citizenship. I believe the right to vote, at a local and not just a European level, should be a consequence of these rights and not a precondition, as seems to have been suggested at times in some debates in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">In our eagerness for integration we must not forget that our first duty, in my opinion, is to create the means for making a living in developing countries, so that everyone can find it possible to stay in their own home country. Our second duty is to facilitate the return of immigrants to their countries of origin as agents for the development and growth of their own countries. Down in third place, I put the need for Old Europe, impoverished by low birth rates and few workers, to see migration as a benefit to our countries. Having said that, there is no doubt that we should have control mechanisms to enable us to combat illegal immigration and, within the Member States, to combat breaches of the host country’s rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
