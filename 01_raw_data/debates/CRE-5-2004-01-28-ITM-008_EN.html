<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piétrasanta (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of this legislature a number of reports about Galileo have been made to the European Parliament in turn by Mrs Langenhagen, who is here today, Mr Glante, Mr Dhaene and myself. They were always presented positively, but nevertheless had to overcome many obstacles to get our European project adopted. It was criticised as duplicating the American GPS, but that made me think of the fable of the blind man and the paralytic. Were we expected to call on the United States to be our eyes and show us the way to go? The cost was said to be ruinous, although it is about the same as building a little more than 100 km of high-speed railway line. Our wisdom finally carried the day and, concerned to implement the European Union’s strategy for employment, economic reform, research, and social cohesion decided by the Lisbon European Council in March 2002, we adopted Galileo.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now been working for nearly a year on this report to bring us up to date on this project and on the integration of EGNOS into Galileo. However, the fear of a delay in implementation was such that we have been overtaken, and happily so, by the project being put in place and I am now in a position to present the excellent results that we achieved in 2003 and to make a number of recommendations for operational implementation in order to ensure that Galileo really does go into service by 2008 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore taking account here of two Commission communications. The first is concerned with the state of progress following the Council decision of 26 March 2002, which saw the informal adoption of the regulation creating the joint undertaking on 21 May 2002, and the second the integration of EGNOS into Galileo. The communication covers the following aspects: the creation of joint undertakings, which has now been done, the system’s security – on our recommendation the supervisory authority was created at the same time as the security centre; its role is vital because it ensures that Galileo will remain a project geared to its users’ wishes; I believe Parliament should be more closely involved with this committee in a way that remains to be decided – service definition and frequency planning, the reservation of frequencies. The problem of the overlay of signals on the fifth service (or PRS) with the US army’s M signal has also been settled. The Commission and the United States have found a compromise. The Galileo signal will surround the US signal and will no longer be overlaid. Relations with third countries have been normalised. There are no problems with the Russian Glonass system. There is some cohabitation, or at least consultation, for the American GPS. And countries are joining us, like China, with whom a promising agreement, especially in the field of research, was initialled in Beijing on 18 September 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of reminder, Galileo is merely a giant clock consisting of around 30 satellites capable of determining a position in time and space very accurately. Unlike GPS and Glonass, it must remain a purely civilian project. The services it will provide are very important, especially in the environmental field. As a tool for protecting nature, it will help to track pollution by dangerous substances, track icebergs, and map the oceans and sea levels. It will help to monitor the atmosphere, the ionosphere, radio communications, space science and even to predict earthquakes or monitor endangered species. It will be possible to pinpoint dangerous substances such as nuclear waste at any time. We have not forgotten space pollution either, since we shall have to ensure that any new object launched into space can be neutralised. There will be many other developments in transport and communications.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress Galileo’s fundamental contribution as a spearhead for our European space policy, integrating more closely the roles of the Union and the ESA. And in the European Research Area, a large amount of funding is provided in the sixth research and development framework programme by the European Space Agency’s ARTES programme and the private partners. With a large part of the funding coming from the public purse, the results of the research and the intellectual property will belong to all the European Union’s citizens. So far as EGNOS is concerned, I propose that it be integrated into Galileo, through the good offices of the joint undertaking, because this satellite radio navigation system can only be based on our global system.</p>
<p class="contents">Galileo is a very important achievement of our legislature. It was proposed and supported by the Council and the Commission, and I want to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio in transport and energy, to the Director-General Mr Lamoureux and also to Mr Busquin for their energy and determination in bringing it about. I also want to thank all my fellow Members for the constant interest they have shown in Galileo, especially those on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Galileo is a fine European Union project. First and foremost, it will help to implement our policy of sustainable development with the ethics essential to an action of such breadth. Our Parliament can be proud to have been a driving force in the dynamic that our Assembly has shown and which will help to make the European Union more independent; it is a step towards a decision full of political significance and one very much called for by our draft Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Piétrasanta report is further evidence of this since it decisively approves the action we have carried out throughout this time and encourages us to move forward. I would like to thank you once again for your support and I would also like to thank Mr Piétrasanta in particular for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that at the moment, as you well know, the Galileo joint undertaking is fully operational and has been since the summer of 2003. Its two main tasks are, on the one hand, to select the future Galileo concessionaire we have four offers on the table which were received in December 2003 following the publication of an invitation to tender for concession last year and these four offers demonstrate the real interest of four consortiums in taking charge of this project and, therefore, clear interest in the private sector in the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element we are working on is the monitoring of the work carried out by the European Space Agency on validation in orbit. A first experimental satellite will be launched before the end of 2005 and a second satellite will be ready to launch during the first half of 2006, because we must begin to transmit test signals, in order to guarantee that we maintain the signals which were granted us originally by the corresponding international body.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to relations with third States, which Mr Piétrasanta referred to a moment ago, what we are seeing is huge interest and this confirms once again that both the Commission and Parliament, which have never doubted the Galileo project, were right and those countries which had concerns or doubts and which for some time have had difficulties promoting the Galileo project, had no justifiable reason for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have in fact signed an agreement with China, the negotiation with India is at a very advanced stage, Brazil also wants to participate in the Galileo project, not to mention cooperation with Russia and, of course, the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">With the United States, we have resolved practically all the compatibility problems with the GPS system by means of cooperation between systems which allows us to enhance and improve the signal and the corresponding services. In this regard, at the last meeting we held at the end of last year, practically all the issues were resolved, there is just one issue to be resolved on open signals and we are very close to resolving it and we hope that tomorrow and the next day, at our meeting in Washington, we can finally resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the honourable Member for his report, and Parliament for the very clear support it has given this Commission initiative throughout all this time, since we have had to fight hard and at times overcome complex difficulties, but I would like to say that it is moving in the right direction. As I said a moment ago, with regard to these three projects: ‘Single Sky’ is under way, Galileo is well and truly launched, and ‘maritime safety’, which we has gone from nothing to a whole package which protects and supports us, not just in the European Union but at international level. Mr President, if I could only mention three, then these would be the three tasks which we will have achieved – and I say ‘we’ because we have achieved it amongst all of us – a team, a Commission team, and I would like once again to thank the services I have referred to, from the Director-General to all the people responsible who have acted and worked throughout this time but of course with the invaluable cooperation of this Parliament, which has given us support systematically and, of course in the end as well, the cooperation of the Council. If the Council is not there, then the system does not work; the Community triangle, once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also looking ahead to this year’s European elections. People are always asking us in what ways Europe is benefiting them, and Galileo enables us to give them an example of how European forces can combine – for only together can we achieve such objectives – in the spheres of business and technology, in a useful way that benefits the future of the Europe in which we share.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems have been described, and it is now urgently necessary that we make headway on the problems with implementation, including the ones that involve the Americans. A large number of obstacles have been overcome. Parliament has been constant in its support for the Commission, the Council has played its part, and now is the time to decide on the tenders. We have to waste no time in installing the system, so that we can work with it, and we have to create the right framework conditions, especially in the structures. This is where I wish to address a point that I see as important. When deciding on the future structures of Galileo, which we will be debating in this House, it is necessary that these should be effective, but it is equally necessary that Parliament should retain its share of responsibility and not allow this dossier to be taken out of its hands. Although I would ask that, when we come to discuss this, we should perhaps get more support from the Commission, I think that we have, together, demonstrated that Europe, the European Parliament, is united in its pursuit of this objective. Commissioner, this House has always been behind you, so in this matter too, we should make common cause in seeing to it that responsibility remains with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the course of our deliberations on this report, we had interesting hearings with experts, whom we were able to ask about their reports, and who had interesting things to say about Galileo’s future uses. Even though some of us had to allow ourselves a slight smile at some of the statements and prognoses, I see Galileo as a model for the future and believe that it will yield returns on what is invested in it, something that is apparent from the fact that there have already been four responses to the invitation to tender. I can remember how, some two years or so ago, things looked very different and there was often doubt as to whether industry would get on board financially. Now we are about to open the documents and announce the result. That is something I cannot but welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Mr Piétrasanta’s report contains everything that matters. There is one further thing I want to mention, on which I tabled amendments in the committee and will be tabling another for the plenary; I ask your indulgence, but it is one that matters especially to me. I refer to the rescue and aid services that are to be implemented. Although COSPAS-SARSAT is well-known, there is also the IMMARSAT-E system, which is preferable to COSPAS-SARSAT in many respects, such as its rapid response times, more precise positioning, permanent availability, 100% compatibility with Galileo, and coverage of the whole of the earth’s surface.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is important to people in trouble at sea, as such information is highly detailed and help can arrive at very short notice. I think this is something to which we should give some thought; a number of organisations – some of them military, like NATO – and Member States are already fitting this system into their Transall transport aircraft, helicopters and naval vessels. I think it would also be helpful to private individuals, and the two systems can certainly exist alongside each other. I hope that we will implement this tomorrow and that Members will support the one amendment of mine that is still to be voted on. Thank you all, and I wish you, Mr Piétrasanta, all the best for the future; something lies in store for you and we will miss you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To this end, it was established that various economic reforms were necessary, as well as a strengthening of research and social cohesion, but nevertheless, in almost all the Member States we are seeing constant examples of relocation of companies whose owners, generally multinationals, are seeking greater profit margins by reducing the manufacturing costs of products, establishing their industries in countries with cheaper workforces and, sometimes, with fewer environmental controls. This creates unemployment in the Union and reduces our wealth and our capacity to achieve the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this unstoppable dynamic caused by globalisation, our reaction must not be to try to compete in order to bring our costs into line with those offered by less developed countries, on the basis of sacrifices on the part of our workforce or of our environmental requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach must be to strengthen our human resources, education, training, technological development, research and knowledge. Only in that way will we continue to maintain our competitive advantage and promote and retain cutting-edge companies and sustain the high level of social well-being, protection and cohesion we enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Galileo project, which we are debating today, is a good example of our taking the correct path. Together with the European Space Agency, the EGNOS programme, and hopefully also ITER, it creates a launch pad so that Europe can be in the leading group in terms of the most important challenges humanity is going to face during this twenty-first century, that is to say, taking advantage of our atmosphere and outer space in a manner which is sustainable and respectful of nature. And since the Earth and the universe belong to all of us, we fully support the idea of Galileo being open to cooperation with third countries such as China, India, Brazil and others, as well as the negotiations with Russia and the United States on satellite navigation. And also that our Galileo transponders be used to assist the existing maritime rescue systems and cover the needs of transport, telecommunications, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and, above all, people.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Piétrasanta on his report as well as the Commission, Parliament and finally also the Council, for promoting the Galileo project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Galileo has proved to be a tremendous success and I hold the view that it is vital for Europe to continue to invest in this key technology into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that, unlike competing global positioning systems – notably American ones – our Galileo project has been used exclusively for civilian purposes. I believe this must continue. I am not keen on seeing Galileo turned to military applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Galileo can play a key role in helping the European Union achieve the competitiveness goals set in Lisbon, goals which form a key plank of the Irish presidency's programme. The future participation of China in Galileo through substantial financial investment in the programme is most welcome. I am convinced that we must go further in seeking international partners who will be pleased to find alternative options to the previous monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the supervisory board called for by Parliament, has indeed been set up. This is an important contribution to transparency and accountability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is why I believe that the report should have expressed greater concern on this issue. We welcome the conclusion of negotiations with China regarding its participation in the Galileo system. In fact, the risks at military level are not theoretical risks, but those indicated by the European Commission as useful factors, from a European point of view, for its defence. I would like to quote from a document – a Commission position paper – of 31 December 2001 which stated that: ‘if the Galileo Programme is abandoned, we will in the next twenty or thirty years lose our autonomy in defence’;<span class="italic"> </span>and again, on 12 March 2002: ‘although designed for civilian applications Galileo will also give the EU a military capability’, and the Directorate General indicated the usefulness of a separate Galileo signal to support the military aspect. In view of this clarification from the European Commission’s Directorate General regarding our technology; it is as well to know that this is also valid for China.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is not about sabotaging the Galileo system; it is explicitly about taking these risks into consideration and taking adequate measures – involving regulations, procedures and, if necessary, sanctions – to prevent these technological repercussions, which are in part unavoidable and only natural, from going beyond what is acceptable. Otherwise, there will be nothing for it but to imagine that the speed and ease with which the agreement with China was reached is part of the European Union’s larger political strategy. I apologise for digressing and implicating the government of the rapporteur’s country, but I believe that the attitude that we have seen recently from President Chirac<span class="italic"> </span>and Prime Minister Villepin regarding the Chinese communist regime is a worrying sign of a very precise strategic and political direction. If adequate countermeasures are not taken, there is a genuine risk of very real technological repercussions over the next few years for the army of a country that is antidemocratic, illiberal and a dictatorship and that knows how to turn secret services and specifically civil espionage to military use, something that our own intelligence organisations are, in any case, also doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, I would really have liked us to have discussed the state of play on Galileo some time ago, and would also have liked to see more regular follow-up. The 2002 Commission communication has now, in 2004, been rendered obsolete by developments in the programme. We cannot carry on being so slow in the way we handle current information, for I fear that any delay in Galileo’s development will make for serious problems if it is to be launched, as planned, in 2008. Negotiations on the award of concessions must be completed without delay. Galileo is still running on schedule, but we have to ensure that it stays on it, albeit without detriment to the necessary care in examining the tenders submitted. We have to press on with the procedure and, of course, get the maximum use out of Galileo. Only then will we be able to be convincing on the international stage. In this respect, the signing of the EU’s agreement with China on the latter’s involvement in Galileo was a very important step, and others must follow.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Council has now mandated the Commission to start negotiating with Israel and India in February shows that we are making good progress by way of bilateral agreements, but it is also of great importance, as has been described in relation to the USA, that we should find a shared basis for cooperation. In this regard, making Galileo interoperable with GPS is a challenge we have to deal with, and both sides must make greater efforts. Recently, there have been major forward advances across the board, and I would like it if future developments were to justify the great confidence placed in Galileo around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying this: Commissioner de Palacio, you are right. Galileo is the third pillar in your personal recipe for success. We wish you a great deal more success in Washington, but also elsewhere, and Mr Piétrasanta also takes our best wishes with him as he embarks on his further career in politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this work does us all credit and I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Loyola de Palacio.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this Galileo is something with a real future for Europe, firstly because of its many potential applications in a large number of services that will benefit our fellow citizens, secondly because it maintains our competence, and especially our independence, in space matters, and lastly because it will provide work for our launchers, which we know are a weak sector in a world where launchers are very exposed to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Two problems remain, however, I believe. First, there is the problem of funding for the operational phase. I still do not understand in what way and how the private sector will be able to involve itself in the infrastructure competitively with a GPS that will provide its services free of charge. From this point of view it will therefore either ask for guaranteed resources or it will seek something in return. I think we must be very careful here. I have always thought that infrastructure should be public and that services should be paid for by those that use them. But I will wait and see what the funding plan will be, which I think should be settled as quickly as possible. Then in the matter of international cooperation – and on this point I agree with Mr Cappato to some extent – I think it is good that China is interested, but not at any price. Firstly, let us make sure that China does not demand that satellites be launched by its own launchers at the expense of Ariane, which needs an institutional market, and secondly, let us ensure that China, which is not a democratic state, does not use it for military purposes, which would be contrary to our essential values and in particular the respect for human rights which we know not to be the Chinese Government’s greatest virtue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Galileo will bring a good deal of direct benefits, such as the EGNOS navigation system, due to make its appearance this spring. It will provide industry with economic benefits and will bring to the navigation sector the competition it has long needed. We would be able to combine the use of the GPS system, Galileo and the Glonass system. I wish now, however, to stress the importance of Galileo’s later potential applications, especially in trans-European satellite-based broadband communication systems. When used in combination with a global positioning function it will make possible many new options in the economy which now we can only dream of. Economically speaking, it is the most effective way to bring broadband within the reach of all Europeans regardless of where they live and without discrimination. Broadband can give the telecommunications industry the extra boost it needs to compete globally. Finally, although I have mainly mentioned here the economic potential for supporting the Lisbon strategy, I would also like to emphasise the massive benefits Galileo will have for search and rescue services and transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As was said a moment ago, there have been difficult and hard times. I remember, for example, that at one point there was a collection of signatures of Members of this Parliament expressing support for a continuation of the Galileo Programme and calling on the Council to take positive decisions once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to insist that if this is one of the great achievements of this legislature, it is because of what it means in terms of enhancing the role of the European Union at international level, our autonomy and our very sovereignty, our future capacities, without leaving any field of technological development out of our ambitions. I believe we have achieved this amongst all of us and there have certainly been really difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond very briefly to certain issues which have been raised. The issue of China and human rights. Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely concerned about the issue of human rights in China, and not only China, since there are unfortunately problems in other countries which are closer than China. The European Union must not back down and must systematically ensure that the importance of human rights is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have is an agreement for participation in the project, with certain limits, with certain elements, but I believe that the aspects pointed out by the honourable Members will of course have to be considered for the future and I believe them to be very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The next question is whether Galileo is a private system. No, ladies and gentlemen, it is a public system, the property of the European Union. All there is is a concession for its management by a private company. But it must be made crystal clear that it is public, with public regulation and furthermore, as Mr Piétrasanta said quite rightly in his report, intellectual property rights and other things will benefit all the citizens of the various countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Why management by a private consortium and why payment services? Why are there going to be payment services when there are free-of-charge services? Because, as you are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, there are three levels, one of which is open, free and free-of-charge for any citizen, like GPS, but unlike GPS it is not subject to ups and downs since it is a civilian project rather than a military one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a free entry level but by means of payment, and with that free entry by means of payment there will not only be better definition and greater precision in terms of the signal received, but also a quality certificate, in other words, it will be known at all times whether the greatest possible precision is really being provided, or if, on the other hand, there is any difficulty which is reducing it. This is fundamental for certain types of service, such as air navigation, for example. With this signal quality certification it will be possible to land, it will be possible to change air navigation systems, for example, and it will also be possible to land simply relying on a system such as Galileo.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the final signal, as you know, is a security signal, closed to public use, intended exclusively for use by governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to thank Parliament once again – and also the Council, for the position it finally took – and all the services of the Commission, and Mr Piétrasanta for his work and his cooperation, and wish him luck in his new duties and congratulate on being lucky enough to mark his final plenary session with such an important and symbolic report for the future of Europe, such as this Galileo Programme.</p>
