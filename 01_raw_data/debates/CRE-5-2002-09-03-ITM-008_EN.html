Given the importance of the subject, migration is one of the five priorities of the country strategy paper covering the period 2002 to 2006 for financial cooperation with Morocco. It is also covered by the Association Agreement between the EC and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach to migration is comprehensive. Attention is paid both to legal and illegal migration and to the socio-economic dimension. This comprehensive approach is also reflected in our MEDA programming. Within this framework we will aim to help the Moroccan authorities to better organise legal migration. A project to set up a migration centre is currently being prepared. Morocco and the EC have also agreed to cooperate in preventing and combating illegal migration. As a first step, a border management programme will help the Moroccan authorities to establish greater border security and to fight trafficking in human beings. This programme, which is worth about EUR 40 million, will be committed in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are addressing the socio-economic causes of migration, in particular in the northern provinces of Morocco, which account for about 35% of total emigration from that country. This region also benefited from substantial MEDA funding and another EUR 70 million are programmed for socio-economic development in 2004. The majority of the existing projects in the northern provinces help improve the economic situation of migrant as well as non-migrant women, in particular through basic education for girls in rural areas, maternal and child health services, promotion of productive activities for women and provision of basic infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to MEDA, the Commission is financing projects under the budget line 'cooperation with third countries in the area of migration'. EUR 3.3 million have been committed for projects in Morocco, in particular in the areas of co-development, intergovernmental migration dialogue and the fight against illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, Morocco and other countries face real problems, given that they are themselves the targets of illegal migration from the south and often find themselves the route through which illegal migrants pass on the way to Europe. We must help them deal with that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, obviously it would help Morocco if we were to be able to move from informal discussions to formal negotiations about a readmission agreement.

By that time, the feed ban should be reviewed. The review will take into account the forthcoming animal by-products regulation, the correct practical implementation of measures to control the feed ban, evolving scientific evidence and the availability of control methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission services are already carefully examining the potential impact of different options for revising the feed ban but it is too early to predict the outcome of that exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the feed ban in the Member States is being monitored systematically by regular inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office. The FVO reports highlight the considerable efforts made by Member States to implement the rules. However, where any weaknesses are identified specific recommendations are made after each inspection to further improve the controls.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has on several occasions expressed its concerns about the safe transport, storage and destruction of meat-and-bone meal. For this reason the adoption of the animal by-products regulation will be much welcomed. It creates a legal framework for the safe disposal of meat-and-bone meal by incineration, burial or landfill. It also lays down the rules for the safe use of meat-and-bone meal as fertiliser, in biogas production and in animal feeding. At present, meat-and-bone meal can only be used in pet food or in feed for animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The new control framework created by the animal by-products regulation opens up the possibility of revising the present prohibition on the use of meat-and-bone meal. The animal by-products regulation includes provisions on channelling and traceability which will ensure that the present stocks of meat-and-bone meal cannot fraudulently be reintroduced into the feed chain. Specified risk materials must already be marked as soon as they are removed from the carcasses, stored separately and finally destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is co-financing a research programme with two main objectives: firstly, harmonisation of the feed ban controlled by classical microscopy as well as improving its efficiency and secondly the development and validation of new methods based on alternative techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following the results of this research programme as well as private initiatives in this field closely and will take the results into account when reviewing the feed ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the outcome of the revision of the feed ban may be, I can assure you that the Commission will not reauthorise the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feed unless every possible risk to consumers and animals can be excluded and the provisions can be controlled properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-products against what it will cost European farmers if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herds or – worse still – if people start falling ill? If you could answer me that, I would be most grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">I still take the view that we need a total feed ban on meat and bonemeal at least until we can determine how infectious the prions responsible for the outbreak of BSE are and until we can define different types of bonemeal for each type of animal. Only then will we be sure that the bonemeal in poultry feed, for example, does not come from poultry.</p>

It is also the protection of animals, but essentially the scientific evidence available to us shows that the transmission of BSE disease to animals is through the consumption of meat-and-bone meal. Ultimately that would put at risk humans eating the meat. That is why we put legislation in place to remove this specified risk material from the food chain. So there are two blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the question of meat-and-bone meal. As I said, the fundamental consideration in putting in place the ban on meat-and-bone meal is public health and the protection of animals. However, as you probably know, this is a controversial issue. Some MEPs and others take the view that the ban is too extensive and should be revised. I do not agree, because I believe that it is by no means clear from the tests undertaken and the research done at the instigation of the Commission in Member States, particularly the work being undertaken by the Food and Veterinary Office, that the controls in place in respect of meat-and-bone meal are sufficiently secure. The need for these controls arises in circumstances where there might be a relaxation of the ban on meat-and-bone meal, but not for feeding to ruminants. There can never be a relaxation of the ban on meat-and-bone meal for ruminants. It might be relaxed for pigs and poultry, which cannot contract BSE and therefore the consumption of meat-and-bone meal is not a danger to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that if the rule on the feeding meat-and-bone meal to poultry, for instance, is relaxed, there is a risk that meat-and-bone meal intended to be fed to poultry or pigs might ultimately reach ruminants, creating the very danger that we are trying to obviate.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I do not see the ban on meat-and-bone meal being relaxed in the short term. However, this can be reviewed in the context of the TSE regulation, in particular Chapter 4, where an amendment can be made by comitology. I indicated to Parliament when discussing the TSE regulation on a previous occasion that, although this amendment can take place by comitology, I have given an undertaking that I will come back to Parliament and, even though it is not strictly required under the legislation, discuss with Parliament what is the best way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it absolutely clear to Mrs Müller that cost is not the consideration. I am sorry if you have been led to that conclusion because I have not made myself clear. The primary considerations are the protection of animals and public health and the ban can never be relaxed for the purposes I have identified unless we can be absolutely sure that the controls in place in Member States do not create the risk instead of obviating it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the number of incidents of Crohn's disease increases, does the Commission support a recommendation that all pasteurised milk products in the Union require a minimum of 25 seconds of pasteurisation in order to decrease the risks of bacterium MAP which is thought to be a triggering factor for Crohn's disease?

<p class="contents">This combination is known to be effective for foot-and-mouth disease and other known animal health, public health and zoonosis risks. However, Directive 92/46/EEC allows any equivalent pasteurisation time/temperature combination, provided it offers the same level of food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of possible links between Crohn's disease and paratuberculosis was reviewed by the Scientific Committee of Animal Health and Animal Welfare in its report adopted on 21 March 2000. It concluded that insufficient data were available to determine epidemiological links between both diseases and no specific time/temperature combination for pasteurisation of milk which would inactivate the agent of paratuberculosis was recommended.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific data available to the Commission indicate that no precise time/temperature treatment has been identified which would completely destroy MAP in milk. In addition, the Commission has funded a project, SACROHN – improvement of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease, which commenced on 1 October 2000. The total cost of the project is EUR 3 million. The Community contribution is EUR 1 639 151. The project duration is 36 months. It is funded by the Life Quality Control of Infectious Diseases programme.</p>
<p class="contents">No concrete results are available from that source to confirm any link between MAP and Crohn's disease. However the consortium is heavily involved in developing new detection methods based on new molecular technologies and culture techniques. Such technologies are being used by the research consortia to facilitate the detection of MAP in milk and intestinal biopsies of Crohn's disease patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts are also focused on using molecular typing techniques to establish any possible links between ruminant sources of MAP and the aetiology of Crohn's disease. The project continues until October 2003. Results will be made available at regular intervals. More information can be found on the website.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of new scientific data coming to light, the Commission would of course be prepared to take any necessary measures in response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important issue, which is affecting more and more people. It is a chronic health issue and has considerable effects on the quality of life of those who acquire this disease. There is increasing evidence – though I agree, for the moment at least, with Commissioner Byrne that it is not conclusive – that there is a link between the presence of these bacteria in pasteurised milk and the incidence of Crohn's disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to consider all the evidence, when the studies are completed, and perhaps hold a seminar or a wider discussion on what measures might be taken, as this is a disease which is increasingly of concern and it is spreading. The most obvious step would be for the Commission to extend the period of pasteurisation from 15 seconds at the appropriate temperature to 25 seconds. This may be the most simple and effective method. I wonder whether the Commission would agree that those steps might be taken at the end of the studies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Refinement of the rules governing motor-vehicle insurance in the internal market</span></p>
<p class="contents">In early June, Commissioner Bolkestein presented a proposal for a directive designed to refine the four existing directives relating to motor-vehicle insurance. As a result of the previous directives, and in response to repeated calls from the Commissioner with special responsibility for the internal market, what is known as the ‘bonus-malus’ system was abolished in Belgium. That also spelt the end of the agreements on premiums concluded among the various Belgian insurers. The possibility of being able freely to determine premiums undoubtedly constitutes good news for good drivers. On the other hand, this will also increase rather than decrease the serious tensions caused by fragmentation. The result thereof is the likelihood that we shall find more and more uninsured vehicles on our roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission take into account that adverse effect during the further stages in the drafting of this proposal for a directive, or will it conversely authorise the Member States to take whatever steps they deem necessary to prevent any undesirable effects on premiums caused by fragmentation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the field of insurance, the Third Non-life Insurance Directive put an end to the system of prior or systematic government approval of tariffs and pricing policy. Compulsory no-claims bonus systems violate the principle enshrined in the directives. I believe that free trade in insurance products is in the interests of the vast majority of motorists, as this allows them to choose insurance companies that reward good drivers with lower premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question raised by the honourable Member in connection with the possible increase in the number of uninsured vehicles, I should like to draw your attention to Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the First Motor Insurance Directive. That article states that all motor vehicles in the Community are required to have statutory liability insurance. It is up to the national authorities to ensure that this obligation is respected. The Commission's recent proposal for a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive, to which the honourable Member refers, does not alter this provision. This new proposal, the Fifth Directive, does not infringe the fundamental principle of tariff freedom. Its main purpose is to revise the four existing directives on motor insurance. The main objectives are to update and improve the framework of compulsory insurance to protect the victims of car accidents, to plug gaps and to clarify some of the provisions in the directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is doing everything it can to improve the efficiency of the internal market for insurance. Its plans are set out in the Plan of Action for Financial Services. The Commission is convinced that greater competition will lead to lower prices and a wider choice of products for the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not always used to hearing you speak like that in this Chamber, so thank you once again.</p>
<p class="contents">You correctly stated that the Commission was aiming to abolish the Belgian no-claims bonus system and move towards a free tariff structure. I have recently spoken to some representatives of insurance companies, who agreed that the new free tariff system could be beneficial to good drivers. But they make the point: what about those who are more clumsy? What about young people who are often persuaded to take out high premiums? The insurance industry is convinced that the new regulations will increase the general level of premiums, and that accident-prone drivers in particular will want to slip out of the system, leading to a rise in the number of uninsured drivers. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner once again, in the light of his proposals and current legislation, what the Commission can do to prevent insurance tariffs rising too high, excessive discrepancies in pricing and accident-prone drivers being squeezed out of the system. What might the Commission be able to do? Is the Commission considering introducing a system based on ranges around a mean, where for instance the standard rate would be 100, with good drivers paying 50 and bad drivers no more than 150? Can the Commissioner give me an answer on this point? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would indeed be strange, Mr President, if I could not speak my own language well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to make the point that the very function of competition is to ensure that prices are as keen as possible. On the one hand this rewards good drivers in the form of low premiums, which Mr Staes seems to welcome, while on the other hand it makes bad drivers pay for their own errors. No one other than the person who causes damage should have to pay for it. Then competition between individual insurance companies should ensure that the rates everyone pays are in line with the insurance products market, and this has nothing at all to do with the Commission. If the Commission were to do as Mr Staes requests, it would eventually encroach on the powers and responsibilities of the private sector, which it not at all its proper role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the project needs to run until 2035. 2005 is not long enough, i.e. the Italian concession needs to be extended by thirty years. The Italian Government sent a message of support through Minister Buttiglione, until recently a Member of this House, and it is to be hoped that this pilot project, which could set an example and which your colleague, the Commissioner for transport, thinks is a positive move, will be seen as such and an exception will be granted.</p>

May I add that this concerns an extension for quite a long time – about 33 years – and thus this project falls under the rules of public procurement and thus competition must play a role in the award of the contracts. After all, competition means that prices will be lower than would otherwise have been the case and also that advantages will accrue to, I assume, the Italian public or at least the Italian State and therefore indirectly to the Italian public. Therefore we should all be in favour of more competition in the award of such immense contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there is a possible cross-subsidisation in favour of rail transport is an aspect which is perfectly defensible. Therefore, when the terms of the contract that is to be awarded are framed and formulated, that condition will have to be included in the contract to be awarded. Anybody who wants to obtain that contract will have to satisfy that condition. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission firmly believes that public contracts must be awarded subject to the rules on public procurements and they basically amount to the fact that competition must be allowed. Otherwise we open the door again to awarding contracts in an underhanded fashion and it will be the public who will suffer.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Non-recognition of European standards relating to solar thermal collectors and systems</span></p>
<p class="contents">Uniform European standards for the testing of solar thermal products have been in force for about a year now. For solar thermal collectors and systems manufactured in other countries to benefit from public solar energy subsidies in France and Spain, they must be tested for compliance with the respective national standards and verification procedures, despite their having already been certified in accordance with European standards. The national verification procedures are not exactly in line with the European standards. What is more, such double verification involves significant costs and bureaucratic obstacles and requires additional time. Verification certificates issued by accredited institutes in other EU Member States are not recognised. That makes market entry considerably more difficult, and undertakings in other EU Member States are put at a considerable competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis domestic manufacturers.</p>

The EN standards applying to these products are voluntary standards. Any national regulations that require compliance with national standards and testing procedures if subsidies are to be granted must be assessed in the light of Articles 28-30 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from these articles, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, that the principle of mutual recognition applies not only to technical manufacturing specifications, but also to any testing procedures to which products may have been subjected in another Member State of the European Union or in a state that is a signatory to the agreement on the European Economic Area. This principle also applies to any certificates issued for products following these testing procedures. Here I refer to the judgment of 17 December 1981, concerning biological products. There is another judgment dated 28 January 1986 concerning type approval for woodworking machines. Then there is the judgment of 11 May 1989 known as the Bouchara judgment.

We all know that cross-community talks have reached an impasse and that the prospect of finding a way out of it by December are slim, to say the least. I should like to put two questions to you. First, as things stand, there is a clear danger that the island will be divided or partitioned and that, unfortunately, would prove that the Communist Party of Greece was right to predict that moves to integrate Cyprus into the European Union would have precisely that result. The question is, first, has the Commission considered that possibility and what plans has it made to forestall it. And secondly, we all know that Turkey holds the key to the Cyprus problem. The impression we get is that the Commission and the Council, the European Union in general, has not explored every feasible way of exerting pressure on Turkey. You referred, of course, to the repercussions which Turkey's stand will have, but I have a feeling that the Council and the Commission could turn up the pressure. The question is whether anyone is actually willing to exert that sort of pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that I have said nothing new. But that is because there is nothing new to report. Which is something we both regret. Responsibility for the political process, i.e. the process which should resolve the whole problem of the future, lies with the United Nations. Neither the Council nor the Commission nor the European Parliament has any competence in this matter. You should be very careful not to undermine the authority of the United Nations here. Which is why it is the established policy of the European Union – and that applies to everyone, Council, Parliament and Commission – to support the efforts of the United Nations with every means at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important instrument which we can give the United Nations and which we have given them is the accession process. The fact that it has come to direct talks at all is only because Cyprus has accession prospects and because the Turkish side now understands that the European Union intends to keep to its enlargement timetable. So I think that the best way of exerting pressure on Turkey – and believe me we shall do so – is to ensure that it knows that the enlargement timetable is non-negotiable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As for the question as to how the dialogue between the two ethnic groups may affect accession negotiations, the Commission's approach is dictated by the conclusions of the European Councils in Helsinki in 1999 and in Seville in 2002.

However, it has also pointed out that a political solution is not a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to the accession of Cyprus to the Union, if the Cyprus question has not been settled by the time negotiations come to an end. The decision will be taken by the Council, taking account of all the relevant factors. There is still a chance that we shall achieve our objective of political solution before accession, which is why the European Council has called on the leaders of both ethnic groups to step up the talks. If a political solution is reached, the accession agreement will reflect the agreement reached.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Council in Seville recently declared, the European Union is prepared to include the terms of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question in the accession agreement.

<p class="contents">The question which you have put refers to religious organisations which you, Madam, say are usurping powers which belong to the state or that there is a danger that they will do so and that, as a result, the human rights of women in candidate countries might be restricted. The Commission takes the view that future Member States have achieved a good level of democratic stability and that human rights, and that includes religious freedom, are respected in future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Religious freedom is guaranteed in all future Member States, meaning that religious communities do of course have the right to take part in social debate in their countries. That is perfectly normal and it happens in every Member State. Religious communities are part of civil society and, like every other social organisation, they are entitled to take part in social debate. In some countries to a greater degree and in some countries to a lesser degree. Governments, the state authorities, are required to watch very closely to ensure that social groups do not exercise powers to which they are not entitled and which, for example, might have an adverse impact on fundamental rights. In theory, as far as equal opportunities for women are concerned, we have made considerable progress from a legislative and institutional point of view in all future Member States, but obviously more needs to be done to foster economic and social equality for women. But that does not just apply to future Member States; it also applies to the majority of current Member States. We cannot say that all the deficits have already been rectified, which is why the Commission will of course continue to monitor developments closely in this area and will include an up-to-date appraisal of the situation in the report which I have already mentioned and which is due to be published in October 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty needs to be ratified because, otherwise, it will be very hard to conclude the enlargement process by the planned dates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would remind the House that the European Council in Seville in June 2002 welcomed the Irish Government's determination to get the Treaty of Nice ratified in Ireland. This issue was aired this weekend at the meeting of foreign ministers in Denmark, the main item on the agenda of which was enlargement. The Member States and the Commission again agreed that we should not interfere in the opinion-forming exercise in Ireland by making statements about what we would do if the second referendum again had a ‘no’ majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is, anyway, surely the case that those who think in political terms must always think of different possible scenarios. We are not, moreover, concerned here with the distant future but with something that will take place quite soon and that will have a major effect on the development of Europe as a whole. It therefore surprises me that the Commission really is not thinking rather more about alternative courses and reflecting upon what might happen if the Irish people were to vote ‘no’ once again. I am certain that the Commission must be thinking along such lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that this is a question of practical importance. If the Irish people vote ‘no’, that cannot be allowed to be decisive for the whole EU. There must be a practical solution. In my question, I pointed out that Finland, Sweden and Austria in actual fact negotiated their way to a practical solution to the problems <span class="italic">before</span> these countries were Member States.

There is no plan B and we are expressly prohibited from engaging in this sort of deliberation. It is perfectly straightforward. If I were to say here and now that the Commission is considering an alternative or that the Commission has an alternative, before we knew it Irish voters would be asking, what is the alternative? We should very much like to know what it is because then we might not need to ratify the Treaty of Nice at all. So if we say there is an alternative, then all we are doing is making sure the Treaty will never be ratified. And we do have a reason for insisting on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice because, not only does it contain the technical requirements for concluding enlargement negotiations in the institutional section, it also contains political requirements for concluding the enlargement process which are indispensable to a whole series of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why we did not opt for the simple procedure in this enlargement round and simply write the institutional rules into the accession agreements was that most Member States felt that both institutional and political changes were needed before this very radical change in the nature and state of the European Union. These changes are enshrined in the Treaty of Nice and I advise you to take account of them. For a whole series of Member States, the Treaty of Nice has to be taken in its entirety. The seemingly convenient alternative, whereby if there is no Treaty, then we simply lift out the institutional sections and write them into the enlargement agreements, is unacceptable to a whole series of Member States and, as far as I am aware, to the majority in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said, first of all, that you should not get involved in telling people what you will do if the Irish people vote against and that, if there was an alternative, the Irish people would want to know what that alternative was. So you are saying you would keep the Irish people in the dark and bully them into voting 'yes'. It is interesting to hear the Commission say that they should not get involved. We have already had Commissioners such as Patten, Byrne and others telling the Irish people they must vote 'yes'. Mr Prodi said that the Treaty of Nice is not legally necessary for enlargement. Giscard d'Estaing said the same thing and that if the Irish people vote 'no' other solutions will be found. But really the strategy here is to pretend that there is no alternative and to try to force the Irish people into saying 'yes' to something they have already said 'no' to.</p>

<p class="contents">Of particular importance to the Canary Islands is the recent effort made to contain illegal immigration by sea. The Justice and Home Affairs Council asked the Commission to undertake a viability study on this matter, in order to work out how to improve monitoring of the European Union’s maritime borders. The main objective of this study will be to provide an exhaustive analysis of the legislative and/or operational measures to adopt. The results of the study will be available at the beginning of 2003. It should also be pointed out that the Community is supporting various projects in third countries, intended to combat illegal immigration. Of particular interest to the Canary Islands is the major programme designed to assist the Moroccan authorities in better controlling their maritime borders on both the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has contributed EUR 40 million of funding to this objective, to which the Moroccan authorities will add a further amount. It should, furthermore, be mentioned that the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 13 June approved an integrated approach in this field, which means that all the relevant instruments of the European Union’s external relations structure will be used. It has been decided to implement a series of operational measures, including systematic cooperation and joint investigation teams to fight against organised trafficking and contraband networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency attaches particular importance to progress in the field of illegal immigration with regard to relations with third countries and to repatriation policy. This will certainly help to speed up the implementation of future measures in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that the situation is deteriorating, it is getting worse all the time, and an increasing number of immigrants are entering our regions. And not only are they entering illegally by sea on boats, but they are also coming by air, in other words, many immigrants are coming to our region from other countries without any control whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of his observations. He referred to Morocco, but he said absolutely nothing about Mauritania; and I do not know whether the Commission is aware, for example, of the discovery of an illegal immigration network operating in Mauritania and on Spanish territory, and acting jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is that, while I think it is right to carry out studies, I have the impression that the Council is not currently supporting the initiatives of Commissioner Vitorino, aimed at a rapid solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They speak in their own name and not on behalf of the Commission.</p>

However, they can accept expenses from the organisers of the event in which they are participating and even some appropriate payment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does, however, provide them with regular training sessions. In 2002 the Commission organised three training seminars in Brussels specifically for members of TEAM Europe. There was a two-day seminar on the external relations of the European Union in which 80 TEAM members participated; a three-and-a-half-day seminar on enlargement in which 60 TEAM members participated; and a two-day seminar on the future of Europe, the post-Nice process and the European Convention, in which 103 TEAM members participated. This training is provided in the Commission, using speakers and interpreters from either the Commission or the other institutions and occasionally outside speakers who do not receive payment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of a visa exemption for Macedonians would require the regulation to be amended, which only the Commission can propose, pursuant to the provisions of Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria for the inclusion of a country on the list of third countries for whose nationals a visa is mandatory or on the list of those nationals that are exempt from visa requirements are defined in the fifth recital of Regulation No 539/2001. These are criteria covering the dimension of illegal immigration from these countries, reasons of public order and security, external relations, regional coherence and the principle of reciprocity. These criteria are not immutable. The extent and the persistence of certain developments with regard to one particular country or another can lead the Commission to propose that the regulation be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">In this field, the Commission makes an ongoing effort to detect such changes and to make a precise assessment of their relevance. In order to undertake this task, the Commission makes use of a range of information from very diverse sources, paying particular attention to the data and statistics from the States Members that it collects from actions undertaken by certain specialised working groups in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it should be pointed out that the Seville European Council of 21 and 22 June asked the Council and the Commission, within the scope of their respective competences, to give absolute priority to certain measures in the fight against illegal immigration. Amongst these measures is the re-evaluation, before the end of the year, of the list of third countries whose nationals are required to have a visa and of those that are exempt. In this exercise of revising the regulation, the Commission will certainly take account of all information relevant to the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in light of the criteria laid down in recital 5 of the aforementioned Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, I acknowledge, on behalf of the Commission, that Macedonia has made a considerable effort to improve its external border control and the quality of its travel documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I even believe that Macedonia is currently adopting legislation on visas that is very similar to the legislation in force in the European Union, which is a significant and positive factor. In order to gauge the progress made by Macedonia, however, we sent a delegation of experts last June as part of the regional CARDS programme. The conclusions of this delegation and the report on the regulatory framework and its implementation with regard to granting visas and the control of Macedonia’s external borders will be available in October 2002. It is then that the Commission will assess the situation in Macedonia, in light of this report and the criteria of recital 5. Only then shall we be able to take a decision on our initiative to review EU legislation on visas.</p>

Any citizen holding nationality of a Member State has the right to move and settle freely throughout the territory of the Union’s Member States, under the provisions laid down in Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of dual nationality, citizens can invoke laws arising from citizenship of the Union. The Commission takes the view, therefore, that the existence of cases of dual nationality in relations between Spain, Portugal and various Latin American countries is covered by existing legislation. With regard to visa policy towards Latin America, Regulation No 539/2001 lays down the lists of third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements or who are exempt from such requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Following up the conclusions of the Seville European Summit, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the Member States, in the aim of re-examining the lists of third countries annexed to the aforementioned regulation. The Member States’ answers can provide a number of suggestions, on the basis of which the Commission will perhaps be able to present a proposal for an amendment to the regulation. The criteria used to determine the lists are defined in the first phrase of the fifth recital of the regulation. Determining which third countries’ nationals are subject to visa requirements and which countries’ nationals are not is undertaken by means of a detailed assessment, on a case-by-case basis, using various criteria, particularly concerning illegal immigration, public order and security and the Union’s external relations with the third countries. At the same time, account is taken of the implications for regional coherence and of the principle of reciprocity. Any decision by the Council in this field is adopted by qualified majority, once the European Parliament has been consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although many people with dual nationality live in these countries, many children and grandchildren of Portuguese, Spanish and Galician citizens are not considered to be European. I consider, however, that this extremely close family link that exists between Portugal, Spain and Galicia and Latin America must be given very special treatment in the solutions that the Commission proposed for the visas discussed at the Seville Council. I hope that the Commission does not forget our family in Latin America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
