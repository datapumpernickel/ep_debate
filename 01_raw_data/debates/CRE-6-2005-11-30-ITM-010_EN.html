I should like to make some introductory remarks on the preparations for the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong next month, before handing the floor to Commissioner Mandelson who is spearheading the negotiations on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members of the European Parliament know that this is a crucial time for the world trading system. The Doha development agenda, launched in Qatar in 2001, is an ambitious agenda. The goals the global trading system has set itself are high, and rightly so. There are few more important issues than the need to reach a consensus on trade liberalisation that will be good not just for development in the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries, but also for our businesses here in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Members of this Parliament of some of the important matters at stake. The last trade round added over EUR 400 billion to global GDP, and estimates suggest that success in cutting trade barriers by a third in the DDA would increase incomes worldwide by more than EUR 500 billion. The global economy enjoyed a boost last year. Real export growth of 9% helped it to grow by 4%, but a successful DDA tackling barriers to trade will continue to fuel world growth for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">These trade negotiations are not simply about altering the relative size of different countries’ slices of the world’s trade pie; they are about making a bigger pie for all members of the global trading system. The DDA provides a real opportunity to improve terms of trade across the world and to demonstrate practically that 149 countries can work together for the common good. A successful DDA will help underpin the status of the WTO as a multilateral institution and help underpin the multilateral trading system. That has to be good for all member countries. A successful conclusion to the DDA is absolutely central to showing that the world has the capacity to confront its multilateral challenges with the necessary purpose to overcome them. However, let us not forget that Doha is a development round. It is an opportunity to tackle some of the most fundamental injustices at the heart of world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important issue, and it will be important at Hong Kong that we reach agreement on an interim package of measures for developing countries, as proposed by Commissioner Mandelson. In particular, the EU would like to see WTO members endorse strong special and differential treatment to give developing countries the flexibility to make their own development choices; agree a package of measures for developing countries related to implementing the Uruguay Round; agree to provide complete market access for all least-developed countries to all developed country markets, as the EU has already offered; agree to eliminate all forms of export subsidy; agree that LDCs should not be forced to open their markets in these negotiations; and agree to take strong action on commodities of special importance to poor countries, address the issue of preference erosion and simplify the rules applied to exports from least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to turn my attention to some of the detailed issues at stake. Commissioner Mandelson will obviously go into these in a lot more detail, so I will simply say that, on agriculture, we have a chance in Hong Kong to tackle distortions in the market that work against the poorest countries. Developing countries would benefit from the eradication of trade-distorting export practices and the reduction of domestic subsidies that can undermine otherwise competitive production in these poor countries. Combined with lower tariffs, this will give all developing countries improved market access to sell agricultural goods to the EU, the US and each other. This would in turn help those countries reduce the still high levels of poverty, particularly in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the idea of increased agricultural imports into the EU, particularly for the larger emerging economies, is liable to raise concerns in some Member States and I certainly do not under-estimate those concerns. For in Europe we spend over 40% of our budget on agriculture to support around 5% of our workforce and only 2% of EU GDP. Japan subsidises its rice by around five times its market value. The US cotton industries receive USD 4 billion a year in subsidies: more than the total income of the four West African nations most dependent on cotton. Meanwhile, in many sub-Saharan economies, agriculture accounts for more than half the workforce and for more than half of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work towards abolishing all developed countries’ trade-distorting subsidies. The effects on poorer countries of the developed world’s agricultural policies are unsustainable and need to be changed. We in the EU have led the way in making those changes. The reforms of the common agricultural policy that we have already agreed are significant and are not always recognised fully by our WTO partners. We have also responded promptly and positively, with the Commission making offers in the negotiations. We now need to see a response from others to what we have put on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">A successful conclusion on the NAMA negotiations could increase global incomes by over EUR 40 billion a year within a decade. That is a great potential prize. If we cut all trade barriers by half we could raise the annual income of developing countries by more than EUR 110 billion – three times the value of all aid budgets put together. Of course, while South-South trade has the potential to grow through the NAMA negotiations, so too do our own economies in terms of increased trade with partners across the world. European exporters still face significant tariff barriers to other markets. The EU could gain EUR 20 billion per year from NAMA alone. So the potential wins from agriculture and NAMA are clear, but it is important that the potential long-term benefits from services liberalisation and trade facilitation, resulting in greater real market access, are also given equal weight in the negotiations. That is something that the Commission and Commissioner Mandelson have been pressing for very strongly on our behalf, because services make up 70% of world output, but only 20% of world trade. Currently both the developed and the developing countries have restrictions on services, and gains on services liberalisation could double the gains from the liberalisation of trade in goods. We all agree that we need to find an effective way of making progress on services. However, I personally believe that we must avoid imposing prescriptive requirements on developing countries to liberalise services.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to speak briefly about the dangers of inaction. I am sure the EU is aware that there are those who feel that the approach we are taking is not the right one. However, in a changing world economic landscape, it is perhaps inevitable that we hear calls for a more protectionist approach to be adopted, within both the developed and the developing world. It is clear that we must resist this trend. Protectionism benefits only small, isolated groups within society; often those with the loudest voices. It impedes growth, stifles competition and innovation and, in many instances, is just plainly unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it would be equally wrong for us to ignore the genuine concerns that prompt such responses in the first place. Those concerns are often over the impact of liberalisation on specific communities that are heavily reliant on particular industries. They arise when people feel that the global trading system has forgotten the human element in its negotiations. Whilst the benefits of trade liberalisation are global, we need to recognise that change can be both local and profound in nature. That is what we are doing with the offers that are being made by the Commission. However, this is also why we need to work hard to ensure that poor countries get the support they need to adjust and take advantage of new trading opportunities. With the other developed countries we must build on Commission President Barroso’s pledge earlier this year to increase aid for trade to EUR 1 billion a year and enhance further trade-related assistance, including investment in infrastructure within growing aid budgets. The EU is by far the biggest provider of trade-related assistance worldwide. We are therefore in an excellent position to encourage others to join us in a significant and effective initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Hong Kong presents us with an opportunity to make significant progress in increasing global trade flows, but we also have an opportunity to ensure that the world trading system is fairer and spreads the benefit of trading more widely. We must not lose sight of the balance needed between the two. That is what the Council, working with the Commission and Mr Mandelson, who is leading the negotiations on the EU’s behalf in consultation with the European Parliament, is seeking to achieve.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peter Mandelson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this is an important debate. Much rides on the Doha Round: for us in Europe, for developing countries and indeed for the whole of the global economy. In just over one week, the Hong Kong WTO ministerial will begin. I know some of you will be there, so it is essential that I report to you formally on where we stand and that we discuss the situation that this round faces.</p>
<p class="contents">We are far from where we hoped to be. Like Pascal Lamy, I had hoped that in Hong Kong we would be able to complete two thirds of the work of the round, notably by agreeing full modalities in the main areas of negotiation. The reason we have not achieved this is simply that after we agreed on the framework agreement in July 2004, the talks were simply becalmed. Some negotiators went through a period of posturing which we were able to break only in July of this year. Although the United States finally put forward an agriculture offer in October, this was many months later than we had hoped. The EU responded within the same month with our own agriculture market access offer. Still others continued to frustrate the negotiation. For far too long we have been stuck on one issue and one set of interests – that of large-scale agriculture exporters – rather than pushing ahead on the whole Doha agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although it is fashionable to blame the European Union for holding up this round by being reticent on agriculture, in fact the opposite is the truth. We have moved the round forward in agriculture, not just once, but three times in the last eighteen months. The truth is that others have been holding back, not because we have done or offered too little, but because they have been demanding too much. This is a development round, not an agricultural exporters’ round, and the two should not be confused.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this delay, rather than go to Hong Kong with great expectations and an equally great risk of failure, WTO members, on the advice of Pascal Lamy, decided to lower the ambition for this meeting. I was the last one reluctantly to accept this, but in doing so, I made clear that it cannot mean lowering ambition for the round as a whole. We must still aim for a successful outcome across the whole negotiating agenda, delivering significant development gains by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, the Doha Round is too big to fail. It is not just about trade, it is about maintaining the credibility of multilateral cooperation; showing that multilateral institutions can find global answers to global issues; proving that trade genuinely can be put at the service of development.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to promote development is to open new trading opportunities to developing countries and then help them with aid to exploit those opportunities. This is even more true for industrial goods and services than it is for agriculture trade, and it is true especially for trade between developing countries. The biggest trade opportunities for developing countries are with other developing countries. The biggest obstacles to this trade are the tariffs on industrial goods that exist between developing countries. I regret that we will not be able to advance this substantially in Hong Kong. That is why we need a tailored development package for the poorest countries, not as a substitute for what we could achieve later, but as a down payment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The main elements of my development proposal which I first made at the Zurich mini-ministerial in October and for which I have been pressing since are: first, all industrialised WTO members should commit to providing duty- and quota-free access to all products from the least developed countries; second, we should adopt a package of special and differential treatment proposals to confirm the flexibilities for those LDCs that exist in the WTO; third, we must enshrine in the WTO’s intellectual property agreements conditions for better access to cheap drugs against pandemics; and fourth, we should adopt a strong aid for trade package along the lines of what was agreed at the Gleneagles G8 Summit. The Commission has set an example with the EUR 1 billion per year pledge made by President Barroso at the G8. I hope the WTO partners can agree to these ideas in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to other aspects of the negotiations. On 28 October, the EU put a comprehensive negotiating offer on the table, including on agricultural market access. This created a much-needed opportunity to move the whole round forward. It was a necessary and right thing to do, as it allowed us to have the first real negotiations at the political level on industrial goods and services, anti-dumping rules and development. It began to rebalance the round.</p>
<p class="contents">I deeply regret that, rather than seizing this opportunity and building on it, our negotiating partners decided to take the easy way out, rejecting our offer on agriculture and criticising it – often in immoderate terms – rather than engaging with it and enabling us to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear about the value of our offer on agriculture. It goes much further than we went in the Uruguay Round. It has to be seen as a whole, not just in terms of the tariff reductions that we are tabling, but including our major contributions on reducing domestic support through CAP reform and our offer to eliminate export subsidies altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">We will reduce trade distorting subsidies by 70%. Already under the 2003 CAP reform, 90% of direct payments to farmers will no longer distort trade. Under our proposal, our average agricultural tariff will fall from 23% to 12%, which incidentally is the same as the current US level. Taken as a whole, this is the most substantial offer ever made by the European Union in any trade round. Each element of it – not just the tariff cuts – will provide substantial improvement in market access, as required under the 2004 Framework Agreement. It will create significant opportunities for agricultural exporters without wiping out preferential access for poor developing countries or doing excessive damage to our own agricultural sector in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to strike a balance. In my view this is the right balance to strike. We have a responsibility to take into account the impact of reform on European farming communities. What is more, this is a round for <span class="italic">all</span> developing countries, notably the poor and needy ones, and not just for competitive agricultural producers who should not seek, in my view, to maximise their own competitive advantage in world markets at the expense of other developing countries in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw last week with sugar how sensitive the problem of preference erosion for needy ACP countries is. It behoves us all, not just in Europe but in the WTO membership as a whole, to take this fully into account. We ignore this at everyone’s peril: those whose livelihoods are threatened by it and those who will bear responsibility if they do not respond to the issue of preference erosion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our offer is therefore substantial, measured and credible. It has injected realism into the agricultural negotiations. Whereas the US demands on tariff reductions and – to a lesser extent – the G20 proposals would without doubt benefit these countries, they would also have a devastating employment effect on our own farmers and on poor countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, much of whose agricultural trade, if we were to accept these demands, would simply be wiped out.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore be very clear. I have no plan to make a further offer in agriculture. This is not justified and would further unbalance the negotiations. The time has come for others to match the effort we have made. Governments and citizens in Europe need to believe that structural change and possible job losses in agriculture will be balanced by the creation of new jobs and new opportunities in other sectors. That is why our negotiating objectives on non-agricultural market access, on industrial goods and services are so important. They are crucial to growth and jobs in Europe and are a vital part of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I will vigorously pursue these interests and, in agriculture, I will also insist on an agreement on, and an extension of, a register of geographical indications. That is how multilateral negotiation works. There have to be gains all round. That means that others now have to engage seriously in creating new market access for goods and services, which matter not only to Europe but also to the world economy and, crucially, to development. This means cutting industrial tariffs as they actually applied, not only lowering bound levels agreed 12 years ago in the Uruguay Round. This, after all, will be the effect of our proposals in agriculture because, unlike many developing countries, our bound and applied tariffs are usually the same.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean going back on our commitment that developed countries will do more than developing countries. Of course we will. We do not expect offers from the least-developed and other weak and vulnerable countries. Nor do we expect other developing countries to match the level of market opening by developed countries. But they must do something. That is the principle of this round.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need progress in trade in services. The current negotiating approach based on requests and offers has not yielded satisfactory results. We need to create a platform for genuine multilateral negotiation which, so far, does not exist. This reflects the importance of services in the modern world economy. It is important not just to us but to developing countries as well. These countries must clearly remain free in services to pursue national policy objectives and fully to safeguard their national right to regulate.</p>
<p class="contents">What we seek is equal treatment for foreign service suppliers in some sectors, not a commitment to deregulate markets or privatise existing operators. Here again, our proposal excludes weak and vulnerable countries and gives flexibility to other developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I will do my utmost to make a success of Hong Kong, to lock in the progress we have made and to establish a platform for us to finish the job in 2006. Above all, it is essential that the meeting does not end in acrimony. I will defend and explain Europe’s proposals. I will pursue Europe’s interests and I will maintain the ambition of the round as a whole, building consensus whenever and wherever it is possible to do so with our negotiating partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that they will do likewise. They must stop hiding behind unfounded criticism of the European Union; stop hiding behind patently unrealistic and tactical demands, and join in a real negotiation on all the issues. If they continue merely to ask for more from Europe without paying into the pot themselves, they – not we – risk destroying this round. They will come away, if that happens, with nothing at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us rather work together for an outcome that boosts the world’s economy, generates political confidence and helps the world’s poor. That is how we went into this round; that is how we want to come out of it. The possibility still exists, the need is as urgent now as it was when we began the round. Everyone must now pull together to make it happen and achieve the objectives that we first set out for ourselves when we agreed the Doha Charter all those years ago.</p>

We are talking about economic, social, environmental and, above all, development benefits. It is precisely these benefits which require us to abide by our high aspirations for the Doha development agenda. The definition of less ambitious and realistic objectives must relate solely to the Hong Kong conference and not to the Doha round overall.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration to be adopted at the Ministerial Conference will need, on the one hand, to freeze the progress already made in individual sectors and, on the other hand, to set clear objectives for ongoing negotiations. It will also need to safeguard specific, tangible results in the sector of trade and development. The agricultural sector is being called – and to a large extent justifiably – the mainstay of the current negotiations. The democratically legitimate position of the Union was the outcome of the last review of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as you quite rightly said Commissioner, has made material and credible contributions to the current negotiations. We expect our partners to make similar concessions and to pursue the necessary flexibility which will allow the balanced progress needed to be made in the individual sectors of the Doha agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The safeguarding of a balanced and ambitious result in all the basic sectors of the Doha development programme is – and rightly so – the core of the Union's negotiating strategy. I refer mainly to the sectors of services, industrial products, the facilitation of trade and the protection of industrial and intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as the biggest trading power in the world, as the supreme factor in world trade diplomacy, is being called on to respond to the challenge of the Doha round, of this development round, to play a material role as far as Hong Kong and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our mandate; the mandate of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as formulated here seven months ago, in good time, in the text of positions adopted by the European People's Party. This mandate is also set out in the motion for a resolution which we are debating. I wish you <span class="italic">bon courage </span>and every success, Mr Mandelson.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harlem Désir, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group. – (FR)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are on the eve of a WTO conference that was supposed to see a real step forward in the implementation of the Doha development agenda, which was adopted in 2001 and was to enable the trade rules to be put at the service of development.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have just said, Commissioner, it is unfortunately now clear that the Hong Kong conference will not bring the results hoped for in the main areas of negotiation. The progress made following the framework agreement concluded at the WTO on 1 August 2004 has been insufficient, and sometimes almost invisible. A lot of precious time has been lost and the sights for the Hong Kong meeting have now been lowered with the real decisions postponed to a later conference in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would like to stress from the outset that this must not be allowed to result in the development aims of the Doha Round itself being downgraded. Any reduction in the developed countries’ commitments concerning the implementation of the Doha agenda would bring a substantial reduction in the possible gains for the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Commissioner, the World Bank has produced a study showing that, if the likely scenario based on the United States’ and the European Union’s present proposals comes about, the main beneficiaries of the Doha Round, as with previous rounds, will again be the major trading powers, the developed countries, while the developing countries will gain by less than 0.2 euro centimes per capita per day; that would cut the number of poor people in the world by scarcely 1%.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that insisting that the developing countries make reciprocal commitments in exchange for the efforts made by the developed countries, in terms of opening their markets in particular, is likely to result in deadlock and from that point of view we must not forget what happened in Cancún. We are convinced that if the Doha Round development talks succeed, maintaining the priority of shifting the balance in favour of the developing countries instead of reciprocity, they will ultimately bring tangible advantages for all, including the European Union, which will share the benefits of renewed world economic growth and the development of new markets for European goods. It is therefore essential that the Doha Round is a success.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is to be the case, the rules and agreements negotiated in Hong Kong must make for a more equitable sharing of the benefits of globalisation; they must take better account of the different levels of development; they must offer improved market access for the developing countries without forcing them to open their own markets at any price, and on this subject I support the Council’s vision, which seems to me to be slightly different from the Commission’s; they must not weaken the most sensitive economic sectors, nascent industries, but instead contribute to economic diversification; they must recognise the right of the developing countries to control the rate of their commercial opening and their national development strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the various players, including the European Union, to be more flexible, Commissioner. I believe you still have room for manoeuvre in agriculture. For example, our Group has tabled an amendment seeking a commitment, with a timetable, to abolish export subsidies by 2010. We are asking that a formula of the ‘Swiss formula’ type, which you are advocating today and which does not respect the principle of ‘less than full reciprocity’, not be applied in the field of industrial tariffs. We must accept the maintenance of a certain level of protection for the developing countries in the industrial field.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to services, we want the European Union’s demands concerning market access for service providers to preserve the rights of all WTO member countries, especially the developing countries, to regulate their services, their public services in particular. We want health, education and audiovisual services to be clearly excluded from the talks, and we do not want public services such as water and energy to be dismantled or weakened in the GATS negotiations. Finally, you have noted the great reticence of the developing countries towards your benchmarking proposal, and it would be more reasonable to withdraw it.</p>
<p class="contents">We support you on the ‘development aid’ package. There needs to be a sustainable solution for access to medicines that includes a revision of the intellectual property agreement itself. The rules for special and differential treatment must be strengthened. Finally, there really is a need for a financial facility to underpin technical assistance and the strengthening of the poor countries’ capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our Group believes that sensitive issues like social and environmental questions cannot be kept out of the WTO talks. Otherwise, public opinion will not support the multilateral system; it will only survive if it is reformed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that Hong Kong will not – unless a miracle happens – bring us the long-expected breakthrough in the multilateral trade negotiations. I just hope that the meaning of ‘Hong Kong’ will not need to be changed from ‘fragrant port’ to ‘silted-up quagmire’.</p>
<p class="contents">The main stumbling block remains, without a doubt, the agricultural dossier. Since Europe will not make concessions unless other large countries make more concessions, we find ourselves in a total stalemate. It is reported that things are even worse for the GATS negotiations, where nothing has been achieved as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Commissioner is right in saying that a Doha round without a substantial and positive attitude towards the services industry is unacceptable for Europe. Should we search our own hearts? I do not think so. Europe has gone the extra mile, even two, in the multilateral trade negotiations. We already boast the world’s largest open economy. The European scheme for general preferences is the most generous preferential system. ‘Anything but arms’ is also unique in terms of exports to Europe by the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, though, the very principle of multilateral trade negotiations is at stake. There is a considerable risk that any fresh <span class="italic">debacle</span> in Hong Kong will completely undermine the World Trade Organisation, because trade blocs will look for, and seize, opportunities to enhance their market access by such means as bilateral and regional trade agreements. This scenario is best avoided if possible, because whilst the poorest countries are at risk of becoming the victim in this, the significance of the WTO, that has, after all, contributed to more economic growth, more development and more jobs over the past 50 years, cannot, and should not, be underestimated, even if this organisation needs, as a matter of urgency, reform in order to bring about more transparency, more efficiency and, above all, more democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we want to strengthen your negotiation mandate and your negotiation position by means of the resolution that is before us and on which we will be voting tomorrow. The fact that there is virtual unanimity in Europe makes your mission hopefully a little less impossible. Whichever way, we in Europe must remain the driving force behind the multilateral trade negotiations. Your key task now is to ensure that there is life after Hong Kong. Our attempts at supporting you in this may be rather modest, but they do carry a great deal of conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This gulf extends to the contradiction between what the Council is saying and what the Commission is doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Alan Johnson, a UK Trade Minister and representative of the UK Presidency, said just a few weeks ago that developing countries must not be forced to open up their markets. He proclaimed that ‘we must reject forced liberalisation’, and yet the Commission is adopting an increasingly aggressive negotiating agenda that is diametrically opposed to this. On non-agriculture market access the Commission is demanding far-reaching liberalisation that will threaten the very survival of local manufacturing in some developing countries. On services, the Commission has completely discarded its former promises about service negotiations being voluntary, and is now demanding a mandatory minimum opening of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is supreme irony, Commissioner Mandelson, in your being quoted in the newspapers today as saying that one voice which has not been heard in these negotiations so far is the voice of the poor, when the European Union is itself guilty of ignoring precisely that voice: the voice of African countries and other ACP countries, for example, which have all said they do not want a new benchmarking formula in the services sector. We are in real danger of repeating the mistakes made in Cancun. The EU is failing to listen to developing countries and is pursuing its own business agenda with extraordinary arrogance.</p>
<p class="contents">A resolution has been tabled by the three larger political groups and I want to explain why our group is unable to sign it. No date has been set for an end to export subsidies. Indeed, ending export subsidies is now made conditional on parallel movement from other industrialised countries. On services, the resolution demands an ambitious agreement with no rejection of the new benchmarking formula, and no clear exclusion of basic services such as water.</p>
<p class="contents">On NAMA, there is a demand for rapid acceleration of negotiations on the basis of an extreme formula which most developing countries have already rejected. Extraordinarily, it is suggested that WTO members should remove their non-tariff barriers since they apparently hamper market access. Those so-called non-tariff barriers include hard-won democratically agreed national laws that protect the environment, social standards and health and they must not be regarded simply as barriers to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Most important of all, however, is the pressing fact that four years into the DDA, the agenda is not delivering for the poor of the world. We need a radical and fundamental revision of trade policy so that this genuinely can be a development round worthy of the name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not therefore too late for the 25 to seriously revise their negotiator’s mandate, which for the most part dates back to 1999, that is before the double failure of Seattle and Cancún. My Group is therefore pleased to submit to you ten proposals for closely linked new priorities, which I will call the ten commandments of an alternative view of Europe’s ambition on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, given that tomorrow is World Aids Day, I will mention the requirement to find a definitive solution to the problem of access to medicines in countries that have no pharmaceutical production capacity. The persistent blockages, in the name of intellectual and industrial property, are criminal and unacceptable in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will mention the Doha Round’s official priority, which has been completely marginalised in practice: development. One after another, Europe has sacrificed all the gains of Lomé on the altar of the WTO –Stabex, Sysmin, the banana agreement, the sugar protocol – in order to get free-trade agreements signed, with the bonus of the introduction of visas for nationals of the countries we used to call our privileged partners. We believe there needs to be a reversal of approach in this regard so that we never again see tragedies such as those of Lampedusa, Ceuta, Mellila or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I will mention agriculture. We are in favour of defending genuine European small farming, the right to guaranteed remunerative prices, the principle of food sovereignty, respect for the social, environmental and territorial multifunctionality of agriculture. What we need to fight is the obsession with productivity, dumping practices that destabilise the weak economies of the South and make them more dependent, and the all-out liberalisation that gives the multinationals access to land, seed, water and the market for goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">The time I am allowed obliges me to mention our other priorities very briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Four, the WTO must prohibit the patenting of living things and protect local communities’ biological resources and technological knowledge against biopiracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Five, health, education, culture, audiovisual services, water and all public services must be expressly excluded from any trade agreement. We are against the GATS and in favour of designating world public goods as outside the scope of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Six, the cultural exemption: no WTO rule must prevent a state from defending what it considers its cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven, employment and training in all parts of the world must become objectives in their own right towards which economic agreements must work; this is the opposite of the liberalisation that is destabilising whole sections of industry and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight, social and environmental standards. Instead of the obsession with cost cutting, there must be mandatory and constantly upgraded minimum standards, and the countries in greatest difficulty must be given compensatory aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Nine, the WTO must be democratised as a matter of urgency, each member country enabled to take part in the talks on equal terms, the transparency of the debates guaranteed and elected representatives involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ten, the WTO must be incorporated into the United Nations system with a hierarchy of international law standards giving primacy to fundamental rights and in particular to international conventions on the rules of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if the EU is able to draw inspiration from an approach of this kind, I think its existential crisis will begin to look like a bad memory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be true of Hong Kong, but not in Ireland, where a sugar industry that supported 3 500 families has just been wiped out. One might consider that a minor matter over which we should not get so upset. But what about a bigger industry, the Irish beef industry, which will not be allowed to stand in the way of global corporate farming either? But then that is not an immediate priority under the plan.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this plan I am talking about and whose outlines are becoming more distinct as things progress? In the Doha Development Round, the plan should be about justice and ending poverty, but it seems to be more about dismantling things to make way for the big players, about getting rid of small producers, who are inefficient, democratic and difficult to control and have inconvenient notions as regards lifestyles, and about assigning each area and each country a specialty in which to work efficiently without bothering anyone. It is about reducing the number of competitors and letting the large corporations loose to do their best.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the question of what their best is. Their best is to make money for their investors – that is what corporations do – and all the rest of their activities are part of this, be it a question of medical services, food or cars. The fewer the competitors, the more money; the fewer the regulations, the more money; the more customers, the more money. That is how the plan seems to be evolving.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Ireland this means wiping out the sugar industry and making way for corporate farmers from other countries. It means corporations installing facilities like incinerators, because Ireland has been marked as being good for that. In the case of other countries it means bigger sugar industries. However, it will probably be the corporations, rather than the people, which will benefit from this, and many of them will not even be owned by nationals.</p>

That will help create trade diversification in our manufacturing and service economy base and stimulate economic growth to the benefit of European businesses and consumers alike.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Doha Round cannot simply be about what the EU is willing to concede on agriculture. Other World Trade Organization partners must also be willing to make a success of this round, not only in the area of agriculture, but also in the industrial services and trade facilitation areas of the negotiations. The non-agricultural industrial market access negotiations must deliver tariff reductions for all products.</p>
<p class="contents">Average EU tariffs are now less than 4%, while some industrial tariffs in Asia and South America are as high as 30%. The bottom line is that the Doha Round should ensure that average industrial tariffs outside the EU fall to less than 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of the EU agricultural system, Commissioner Mandelson has succeeded in the negotiating mandate given to him by the EU governments. He has already offered an average cut of 46%, which will apply to import tariffs, although there was a clear understanding that the 1999 and 2003 CAP reforms were in preparation for cuts of 36%.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not talking about large-scale agricultural exports, Commissioner Mandelson, but about small farmers in the west and north-west of Ireland, who will soon go the way of their sugar counterparts there whose trade has been wiped out. Is that fair? Is that a fair system? It is not and cannot be! The pretence that it is the developing countries who will benefit is totally erroneous. The real beneficiaries will be the big beef barons of South America and elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the primary duties of the EU has to be to provide a secure source of food for its people. In the rush to secure a WTO deal, I trust that this basic obligation is not being either jeopardised or compromised. Last summer, in the United Kingdom at least, we saw the corrosive effect of cheap South American beef imports on our indigenous beef industry with plummeting prices threatening the survival of many producers. That was with the tariffs as they are at present. If tariffs are further slashed, as has been proposed, then local production will fall, national herds will disappear, and we will become predominantly dependent on South America for our supply of red meat.</p>
<p class="contents">What then if pandemic disease outbreaks, already ravishing Brazil in terms of foot-and-mouth, spread throughout that continent? How then will we feed the people of Europe? They will not thank us then for a headline-grabbing, ego-satisfying deal at the WTO if we have cut off from ourselves a secure supply of reliable food that is home-produced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in this House are treated more as observers than actors, but we care for the welfare of our citizens as well as for poor people elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the predominant idea guiding this process is that of helping the least developed countries of the world, it is also our responsibility to consider the status and development of poorer and weaker new Member States of the EU. The case of sugar has provided an example of an unjust trade agreement that attributes more export freedom to French and German sugar producers than to Polish farmers. The latter clearly cannot be happy about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Full liberalisation would, at least under current socio-economic conditions, mainly benefit strong companies and leading groups rather than weaker ones. Therefore, balanced decisions on making the market a free stage are needed, with a distinction being drawn between the least developed countries, developing countries or emerging economies, and the developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My other point relates to prospective new members. The WTO must carefully scrutinise the criteria being applied. Otherwise, international trade is liable to be shaken by events such as the current issue of Russian import barriers on agricultural products from Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The belief that the free market is a magic wand that can equalise living standards across the globe needs to be tempered with an awareness of the specific economic and social conditions and political barriers that exist in many countries. I would like to see the free market making the people richer, and I stress ‘the people’, not trade and manufacturing consortia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both of you have rightly highlighted the need for our trading partners to move forward, and for them to do so to varying extents. Commissioner Mandelson pointed out that the United States’ agriculture offer was very late in coming, but we also know that the emerging economies will still, in the field of services and also of the liberalisation of industrial goods, need to give indications of coming up with a reasonable package to which we can agree. Listening to some Members in this House, one feels that we do not actually have any interests of our own, but that the only thing that matters is safeguarding the interests of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we take seriously the message that goes out from this development round and treat it accordingly. This is indeed a Doha development round, and this time it is intended that priority be given to the developing countries, the poorest above all. Let us never forget how much the European Union is already doing and how great is its contribution to greater fairness for them.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office has already said, we have to become aware of the changed landscape of globalisation. We now have to deal with emerging economies that are aware of their own power, that are global players in economic, social and political terms and want to do what they have to do and play their part. If they are to do that, though, it is to be hoped that they will take a responsible attitude towards this round. If we fail to achieve a positive outcome, or at least a favourable indication as to what further negotiations will be like, more bilateral agreements will be needed, and we will see multilateral negotiations falling apart – which, I trust, is not what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a couple of important points I would like to address. Firstly, I hope that we will take the same approach as we did to previous rounds of negotiations; that we will have talks with the Commission, with the two Commissioners dealing with these matters, and with Commissioner Mandelson in particular, but, of course, also with the Council. It would be nice if you were to say something about that later on. You are, we know, negotiating within the very tight framework of the mandate you have been given. In the event of any conflict and of you being required to negotiate outside the framework set by the mandate, it would be right for you, Commissioner, to enter into dialogue not only with the Council, but also with the delegation of this House that will be there with you. Even though I know you are not bound to do so, it would be good if you were to discuss these matters with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union will, as it does on every such occasion, be joining with the Inter-Parliamentary Union in holding a separate conference with members from all the various WTO member states present. We would, of course, be pleased if this body were to be able to have talks with you.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we emphasise every time how much we would like to see, in the declaration of intent that you help to produce, a concluding reference stressing the involvement of the parliaments in these negotiations, by which I mean not the involvement of the European Parliament – that is for us to do – but the involvement of the WTO parliaments as a whole. I would be delighted if you were, this time, to succeed – with the Council’s support, of course – in getting a statement to this effect incorporated in the WTO’s final statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Failure to agree terms will not just be a missed opportunity. It threatens parity and prosperity for the developing world; jobs, growth and security in Europe; and the future of the multilateral trade system itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the ‘Make Poverty History’ campaign, millions have made their voices heard. They are angry – and rightly so – about unfair trade rules that work against those living in poverty and they are passionate about the need for change. Grand gestures about free trade from the G8 leaders at Gleneagles now need to be transformed into a flexible negotiating strategy to deliver on all parts of an aid, trade and debt relief package.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing, yet again, the historic struggle between free trade and protectionism. Initiatives like duty- and quota-free access for LDCs, special and differential treatment, and aid for trade cannot be held up in an agricultural silo by more advanced developing countries, especially when the offer on the table is the most substantive ever made by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The offer is not perfect. In an ideal world, it should go further, with the principle of less than full reciprocity to all NAMA negotiations, or reduced subsidies for sensitive products. That could still happen, but, for now, compromise and leadership is necessary – the kind which the more advanced developing countries will have to accept if they are to receive any benefit from the current round.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure in Hong Kong will allow the US and Japan to increase trade-distorting domestic support by up to five billion dollars, and Europe by up to 25 billion dollars. That is why Pascal Lamy told a forum of African ministers last week that this is what is at stake and this is why we have to bid on what is on the table although it is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Before allowing these talks to collapse, the world must ask itself how many more failures the WTO can suffer before it falls apart. How much more frustration can be endured before a new regionalism emerges and the poorest countries are left behind? Yet we have been told that a soft landing is all we can hope for in Hong Kong. But by late 2006, the US mandate will have run out and, with it, the chance to eradicate poverty. Our revised ambitions for Hong Kong must therefore not be a soft landing, but rather a springboard or, as Commissioner Mandelson has said, a platform for delivery early next year. On that, Commissioner, we are with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have to tell Commissioner Mandelson that this traditional attitude is a thing of the past; today, you come to the table not with the power of military persuasion, but with ideology and the instrument of liberalisation, yet it will not work, for the countries of the developing world are now standing up for themselves, making their own interests visible and countering the intellectual property that we want to sell to them in the form of over-priced services with what is theirs culturally, socially and ecologically, along with the right to basic sustenance.</p>
<p class="contents">When talking about agriculture, it has to be clear to us that the European Union is the largest importer of food and feeding stuffs and that we, when obtaining agricultural products from the countries of the developing world, have to pay prices at our levels for them if these countries’ economies are to develop. One sensible course of action would be to put the customs duties into a fund to finance projects for the development of rural economies across the world, which would also kick-start the enterprise economy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the sort of contribution that we could make, but if we think, Commissioner Mandelson, that we could buy up their stock under the poverty threshold, we will then be making famine worse. Trade does not fill stomachs and the only people it makes rich are those who make a profit out of it – in the main, multinational companies that do not have a presence in the countries of the developing world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, though, you peek behind the facade of fine words, the current WTO round of negotiations turns out – yet again, alas – to be all about access to markets. That is apparent most of all from the great pressure that the industrialised nations bring to bear in order to secure a market opening for non-agricultural products and services, making this a precondition for progress in negotiations on the agricultural sector. All they offer the developing countries in return is a vague and noncommittal announcement about the abolition of export subsidies, which is – to put it mildly – unfair. Agricultural export subsidies must be abolished without delay, and, moreover, without demanding a <span class="italic">quid pro quo </span>for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">A distinction must be drawn, when considering domestic agricultural support, between legitimate support and those types of support that serve only to promote the interests of export-oriented agro-business. What that means is that the CAP, too, must stand the test of this comparison.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a new international legal hierarchy to create a balanced relationship between trading interests on the one hand and human social rights, together with environmental and consumer protection standards, on the other. If I mention such things as the relocation of businesses, dumping – both in terms of working and social conditions – or the ecological disasters of recent months, they will remind you of how urgently such an approach is needed. The consequence of that would be that each country would be entitled and required to decide independently when, to what extent, and how fast it would open up its own market. Services of general interest must be protected against further liberalisation; vital services such as water supply, health and education, in particular, must be excluded from international trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The TRIPS Agreement needs to be reformed. Millions of people die every year because TRIPS denies them access to the medicines they need and instead helps the pharmaceutical conglomerates to maximise their profits. One thing we regard as important is the application of the precautionary principle to food imports. If countries, and their peoples, reject the production and import of genetically modified organisms or meat containing hormones, then that is a decision that the WTO will have to accept; no trade regulation of any kind whatsoever must interfere with their sovereign right to take it.</p>
<p class="contents">A new approach is also needed to raw materials policy. Rather than simply doing away with existing market regulation mechanisms, as happened with sugar and bananas, thereby driving prices right down, the Commission should put forward new public initiatives that would help stabilise the prices of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told, over and over again, that to do so would not be in accordance with WTO rules. In that case, the WTO’s rules will simply have to be changed, which they can be, if there is the political will to do so. I believe that this must be pursued with a great deal more energy, and now is the time to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, that country has made a tremendous offer: it has put the offer on the table; it has said it is prepared to make big cuts in agricultural subsidies; it has said it is prepared to make major tariff reductions on agricultural goods and it has challenged the European Union to match the offer. Now I think that there is a big change in Washington, the free trade arguments are winning, but are we going to play the game? Well, Mr Mandelson has made it clear already that we are not going to play the game. As Pascal Lamy has said, the US proposal was five times as ambitious as the EU’s response. Now whether this is the European Union speaking, or whether it is the undue French influence on trade policy, I am not sure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all of it makes me think, because just last weekend there was a Commonwealth conference. A third of the world’s population was represented there and they were asking Mr Blair for a trade deal. But Mr Blair had to say there was nothing he could do, because the British do not have a voice – that is all sorted out by Mandelson over in Brussels, and he speaks for all 25 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that if there was an independent British voice – and I am talking here about the world’s third largest trading nation – at the WTO next month, it could actually speak up for the Third World. I hope Mr Blair crowns his Presidency by pulling Britain out of the common commercial policy and going in next month himself to speak at the WTO.</p>

<p class="contents">China has flooded the European market with seemingly low-cost products which in fact come with a very high price tag. Products from China – from clothing to processed foods, right through to technological equipment – are being made without any respect for human rights, for ridiculously low wages, without any consideration for the environment or guarantees of consumer safety and often through the use of child labour. What is more, all too often these goods are counterfeit, and so give rise to a huge market financing criminal organisations, in addition to directly damaging European companies and undermining their long tradition of professionalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Our businesses do not seek privileges or the enjoyment of special positions: all they ask is to be able to compete in the international market on an equal footing, with joint respect for the rules. Unfair competition from China is killing our businesses and putting millions of jobs at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we ask the European Commission to show its courage by intervening to protect manufacturing and jobs in Europe. In view of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, we ask the Commission to insist that social and environmental clauses be introduced to prevent unfair competition from China, especially clauses which prevent social and environmental dumping, protect workers and the environment and actually place the safeguarding of rights above the movement of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreements should not be reached with people who exploit others, damage the environment and fail to provide guarantees on respect for human rights.

<p class="contents">Since the creation of a parliamentary Committee on External Trade in 1979, this Parliament has followed the negotiations in the WTO closely, sending delegations since 1988, particularly now that we have a specific Committee on International Trade. The European Parliament thereby enhances the role that the European Union plays within the context of globalisation, at the same time making an effort to increase the transparency of the activities of that Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the failures of Seattle and Cancún, it is now that the role of the WTO is at stake. As Commissioner Mandelson has told us, Hong Kong will be difficult but not impossible, and it must therefore be approached with a combination of realism and ambition. As other speakers have said, we cannot allow another failure.</p>
<p class="contents">This Round, which is the priority objective of Community trade policy, is the best way to guarantee that the expansion of trade takes place in a balanced fashion, creating growth, but at the same time sustainable development within a multilateral context.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the countries negotiate by making concessions in certain sectors in exchange for obtaining advantages in others. We must therefore all make a genuine effort to ensure that our offers are balanced. The European Commission has proposed a package in the field of agriculture which represents a great effort for the Union and probably much more for certain Member States. It will not, however, be possible to conclude these negotiations successfully without making progress on access to the markets for industrial products and the trade in services. The services sector, the most rapidly growing sector in the world economy, is essential to the Union and, furthermore, it is very important in itself and in view of its repercussions for other economic sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the NAMA, negotiations are at a standstill and are always dependent on results in other areas. Within this context, Commissioner, I would like to say that it is important for fisheries products to be given special treatment, differentiating them from other non-agricultural products. I believe that, given their special characteristics, resulting from the fact that they are a finite natural resource, they should continue to be given the same treatment as in the Uruguay Round, that is to say, they should be treated as sensitive products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Commissioner, simply by wishing you every success in your work for the good of everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost simultaneously, a decision was being taken to make drastic changes to the sugar regime that has been in place in the European Union for many years. Those drastic changes will have huge implications for the 18 sugar protocol countries in particular, as well as for LDCs. Similarly, decisions that will destroy thousands of livelihoods in banana-dependent countries – our traditional suppliers – were also taken last week.</p>
<p class="contents">When you say these things in the Council, how can you simultaneously do the opposite? It was decided in the Agricultural Council to grant EUR 80 billion to European sugar farmers. Contrast that with the paltry EUR 40 billion which is to be given – we hope, as currently it is still virtual money – to ACP countries. They will in fact lose more in refining aid than we are preparing to give them to assist in their transition from this.</p>
<p class="contents">At that Council meeting, Commissioner Fischer Boel said she felt that this reform was going to strengthen her hand. I really cannot believe that. This morning Commissioner Mandelson and I were at a G90 meeting, where we heard the grievances of the ACP countries in particular. If Commissioner Fischer Boel thinks that she has strengthened her hand to negotiate with developing countries after the decision that was taken on sugar last week, then I do not know exactly what planet she is living on.</p>
<p class="contents">What we felt at the G90 meeting this morning – and Commissioner Mandelson will confirm this – was a terrific sense of anger and, indeed, of betrayal. I know the Commissioner is not responsible for distributing the aid that these countries need, but something has to be done in order to rebuild confidence in the very short time available to us between now and Hong Kong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agenda of the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference sets out a number of significant issues, but let me begin by addressing the issue of trade facilitation. This stage of the negotiations requires the improvement of WTO rules in the areas of freedom of transit, duties and formalities in connection with export and import as well as publication and administration of trade regulations. Trade facilitation would allow the application of equally stringent customs procedures for all, the carrying out of consultations and informing all WTO members in advance of the introduction of trade regulations; it would be beneficial for all trading countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect includes other questions that are not slated for consideration or actual decision at this conference; however, discussions on these matters are necessary, involving the revision of WTO rules by introducing social, labour and environmental standards. Naturally, a number of WTO countries with low labour and environmental standards are not willing to discuss these issues, as this poses the risk of losing their competitive advantage against countries that maintain higher standards. Perhaps these issues should have been considered earlier; however, it is necessary to do so now, since as of this year, with China’s aggressive penetration into the world’s textile and other markets, countries with high labour and environmental standards are beginning to lose the battle of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions on trade liberalisation should involve the issue of equal trade conditions for all countries. These discussions are essential, since we can no longer consider trade independently and apart from production, occupational safety and environmental issues. In all likelihood we should reconsider the means of decision-making at the WTO in order to avoid favouring the special interests of countries and blocking open discussions and decision-making processes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the two main points of departure.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I should like to thank Mr Désir for his constructive amendments. The proposal rapidly to phase out the industrialised countries’ agricultural subsidies is particularly constructive. We in the EU must accept that it is the developing countries that still need to have their production subsidised and that it is we who must phase out our own subsidies. Agriculture is the weak point in this resolution, however. There is no demand for lower agricultural customs duties in the EU, and there is no support for Mr Mandelson’s latest offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is crucial that the industrialised countries agree to pay a higher price than the developing countries for a WTO agreement. Moreover, China and Brazil must, of course, also be counted as developing countries. It is in these countries that half of the world’s poorest people live, and it is unacceptable to say that these countries do not belong to the poor part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would provide millions of people in the poorest countries of the world with opportunities for development and for sustaining their livelihood. At first glance, the offers tabled by the EU regarding agricultural policy seem fairly constructive but, if one reads the small print, it becomes clear that the EU’s offer contains a good deal of hot air.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst mistake the EU can make ahead of, and during, the negotiations in Hong Kong is to make agricultural reforms conditional on developing countries opening up their services sectors. This is the kind of blackmail that could cause the whole Hong Kong Round to collapse. In my opinion, the developing countries’ demands for protection of vital parts of their services sector from exposure to competition are entirely legitimate, given the levels of development of these sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not be afraid to vigorously dismantle trade barriers, even if this would put our competitors at a greater advantage in administrative terms than before.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, farmers across the EU are worried by the non-existence of precise evaluations, the impact of product agreements, and indications that the Commission is willing to sacrifice agriculture in favour of other commodities. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to reiterate how essential it is to recognise the specific nature of agricultural commodities, mainly in the interest of food consumers who, at the end of the day, derive greater benefits from a stable market in foodstuffs than the farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe and the world cannot afford any other outcome. If we are to succeed, a great deal more is, however, required of all the parties involved, as it has been proved that putting the blame on each other, as we are doing at present, does not produce results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important for us to bring about substantial liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products. Many Members of this Chamber tend to oppose precisely this kind of liberalisation, but they are wrong to do so. Both consumers and farmers in Europe deserve access to a global market, and we need the pressure for change brought by liberalisation in order to enhance our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The agriculture negotiations are also – or perhaps chiefly – a moral issue, because they are the prerequisite for development in many poor countries. That is why it is a great shame that these very negotiations are standing in the way of progress in the negotiations both on industrial products and on the trade in services, which is so important to Europe. All those who argue that Commissioner Mandelson has already gone too far and who think that we cannot liberalise agriculture any further must realise that their policies come at a high price and that Europe – the world’s leading trading power - will pay dearly for failure to obtain new market access. We must remember that it is not agriculture but the services sector that currently accounts for 70% of growth in Europe. It is rather paradoxical that the country that refuses to offer any more in the negotiations on either agriculture or services is the one that currently has the largest global players in that very services sector. It is they that should be the first to recognise the need for success in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">The politicians and NGOs, such as Attac, which are currently attempting to thwart the negotiations are doing so at the expense of the poor. Having less trade liberalisation and more quotas and tariffs, or letting the developing countries hide behind high protective walls, benefits those who are already privileged, but what the people – the consumers in poor countries – need is investment. We must give them the same right to low tariffs and prices as consumers have here in Europe. If we succeed in agreeing on substantial trade liberalisation, European consumers will feel the difference in their pockets. If we do not succeed, it will be a matter of life and death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My comment is that following the reform of the sugar WTO, we are finding, contrary to what is often said, that it is the least developed countries that are now asking us not to continue solely down the road of tariff cuts and preferential access to markets, but to try to define relations that will really allow them to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the major comment I wanted to make. It is rather paradoxical in that we can protect agriculture in particular, while at the same time enabling many of the least developed countries to develop. I conclude from this, Commissioner, that two important things must be kept in mind and given equal priority in the world talks and in the quest for a general balance that will avoid a return to bilateralism where the strongest wins. Firstly, negotiations on access and tariffs and secondly, protection and the idea that preferential agreements are just as useful for development today as purely commercial thinking.

<p class="contents">The Commissioner, however, was very categorical with regard to agriculture, stating that there would be no further offers because agricultural change would also permit other opportunities in other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Community agreed the Fischler reform of the common agricultural policy, however, our farmers were told that the reform was necessary to present them at the negotiations at the Doha Round in a way that was credible and justifiable to the international community. The strain placed upon our farmers by this reform and the effects this reform has had have still not stabilised. Despite all this the Commission, rather than highlighting to our partners how much the farmers have already suffered, is proposing a new negotiating position which throws the CAP into question and forces our farmers to make further destabilising sacrifices, that is to say yet another variable they cannot sustain. In order to ensure greater access to the market the Commission is proposing reductions in tariffs which expose our producers to unsustainable competition from imported products.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Commission has not fully taken into account the impact this liberalisation is having upon Community agriculture: for certain products the reform is translating into an appreciable fall in prices and a steady reduction in exports. In short, the CAP is being sacrificed to obtain greater service and research concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for geographical indications, the Commission wished to make acknowledgement of them by our international partners a condition of the negotiations. The Commissioner himself confirmed yesterday, to the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture, that he will not consider the negotiations concluded unless these demands are met. It does not appear that our negotiating partners are ready to satisfy such a request. For this reason we ask the Commissioner to take a decisive stand so that we can move towards the creation of an international register for all geographical indications, which will allow our traditions of quality to be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that an equally strong signal is needed on export subsidies. We cannot commit ourselves to abolishing our support for exports until a similar commitment is made by those countries which, even through different mechanisms, still support their own exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The citizens know this and, since Seattle, many of them are mobilising. There are great hopes and expectations to which we politicians must respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Hong Kong is not the end of the Round, but we must not allow it to become a complete halt. Like bicycles, the WTO topples if we stop pedalling and we cyclists fall with the bicycle. If we fail, we will all be losers: bilateralism, Darwinism, protectionism and discrimination will win.</p>
<p class="contents">The ambitions of the Round must not be reduced, even when it seems necessary to reduce them for Hong Kong. The Round must continue to focus on development, but, Commissioner, we must also defend the interests of our own citizens. This is why we in this House continue to support the Union’s objective and the strategy of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We would call on you to persist in your efforts to reach a balanced agreement in the different areas of negotiation: development, agriculture, NAMA and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is at a premium: the Round should end in 2006 so that it can pass through the fast track of the United States Congress as soon as possible. The WTO bicycle cannot run into a wall in 2007, once the negotiating mandate granted to the Bush administration by Congress runs out.</p>

The European Union cannot sacrifice agriculture for the sake of WTO negotiations, and that the European Union has already done a lot for developing countries – for instance, 85% of African food exports arrive in the European Union. However, we must also add that the European Union must have an active approach to agricultural negotiations too, because it cannot restrict itself to a defensive position. We must try to ensure that regulations concerning animal welfare, environmental protection and geographical origin protection are built into the WTO agricultural trade regulation system, as this is in the interest of both European farmers and European consumers. Mr Peter Mandelson does not have an easy task when leading negotiations, as he must try to ensure that the results of the negotiations are favourable to all 25 Member States, and the various benefits given to our various Member States are kept in balance. The Doha Round is a development round, and it would be unacceptable if the results were to benefit only those Member States with the most developed industry, and the less developed, poorer Member States relying mostly on agricultural activities would suffer, meaning that the rich would become richer and the poor would become poorer. This would be particularly unacceptable now, when the British Presidency has made a proposal to reduce cohesion funds by 10%.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to express the warmest thanks to Mr Pearson, and especially to Commissioner Mandelson, for demonstrating their awareness of the fact that the first thing required for there to be agreement in the WTO round is a great deal of work. It demands good and careful preparation, the development of a strategy, and, at the end of the day, it demands that they bring home an outcome that satisfies everyone concerned. Very difficult though it may be to bring about a win-win situation, such a thing is possible. The worst-case scenario for all concerned is that we come back from Hong Kong with the message that nothing has been achieved and that everything will continue in the same old way. We can certainly take it as read that, if everything continues in the same old way, nothing will remain the way it was, and that we will be running the risk of provoking a new trade war.</p>
<p class="contents">That was our experience at the time of the steel dispute, when all at once our telephones in this House started jumping off the hook, with businesses and trade unions phoning up to tell us that hundreds and thousands of people were having to be laid off because 100% mark-ups for customs duties were making exports impossible. After all, one third of our jobs depend on exports, and small and medium-sized enterprises are affected most of all, for they employ two thirds of our workers, who in turn pay 80% of the taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commissioner, and also the Council, to take genuine action in order to get, at last, the Singapore criteria, which are so crucial to the development of family firms and of small and medium-sized enterprises, seriously discussed again at international level and an examination set in motion of what approach will enable us to move forward in the negotiations. What is at stake, quite simply, is equal access to markets, something that is very important to all of us, in that it will enable our exports, in future, to help the Lisbon Strategy work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, though, it is these very groups – namely the Group of the Greens and also to some extent the Socialist Group – which, when we were debating animal welfare, the environment and a number of other demands on European agriculture, were the first to call for the imposition of additional requirements. Everything comes at a price and that is nothing to do with fair trade; if you impose a high European standard in the field of food safety, the environment and animal welfare, and subsequently throw open the borders under the banner of free trade under very different conditions, then that is anything but fair free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">People in this House should realise that at present, 80% of the food exported from Africa is headed for the European Union. So why is it said that Europe does nothing for the developing countries? Why? Does that also apply to the British Presidency? The British agenda, namely fresh reforms in European agriculture, will not become the agenda for the Hong Kong negotiations. We have achieved a far-reaching reform programme for European agriculture in 2003. That is quite enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done more than any other trade bloc in the world and I expect our British negotiator, Mr Mandelson, to stand up for the European continent as well as for those reforms, for those decisions that have been taken and not one step further. He should equally ensure that world trade is conducted fairly under fair conditions – and that includes agriculture. This is the sort of thing we can expect of a negotiator, so it is better not to have an agreement at all than to have a flawed one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to see that Members of the European Parliament are so engaged in these important issues. I certainly look forward to discussing them further with the delegation that will be going to Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">The key message I take from this debate is that we should maintain our level of ambition for the round as a whole. We should be supporting the package of measures for developing countries outlined by Commissioner Mandelson and this must be seen as a down-payment with more to come, not a final deal.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not underestimate the benefits of trade to the developing world. Just look at where South Korea was in the 1950s – a country with a similar level of income to the average in the continent of Africa – and compare that with where it is today as a result of trade. Look at China, which over the last 20 years has taken one third of a billion people out of extreme poverty as a result of trade. The results are enormously impressive. Our objective should be to kick open the door to the developed world’s economies for the least-developed countries. That is what the EU package is about.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not underestimate the benefits of an ambitious trade round to the European Union either. As Commissioner Mandelson said, the benefits in terms of services and NAMA if we achieve a balanced outcome to the round will be of benefit to the EU economy and indeed the world economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">There are difficult issues in this trade round. We have heard about sugar, bananas, cotton: all these require discussion internally and will be part of the negotiations. As the UK Presidency we fully support the Commission and its negotiating tactics in the round. Commissioner Mandelson has made a serious offer that requires serious consideration by other countries. We now need to see progress on NAMA, on services, on the part of Brazil, India and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to you, the Members of this Parliament, that we recognise that we all have to take any final deal home and justify it to our electorates.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked about the specific arrangements for Hong Kong as regards the European Parliament delegation. The UK Presidency is making plans to meet with members of the delegation near the launch of the conference and hopefully again towards the end. The Commission will be holding daily briefings that will be given to MEPs. We are also planning a reception co-hosted with the Commission for MEPs to meet with EU Ministers.</p>

<p class="contents">One thing I am sure about in my approach to Hong Kong and in the approach to the round as a whole, is that I have an obligation to do what is right in the long term, rather than what will get me cheers in the short term. I have found in my time in this job that it is very easy to play to a gallery. It is very easy to mouth the slogans; to say the things that will please the people you are talking to; to get them to champion you and give you all the cheers in the world. But when I say what is right in the long term, rather than what will get me praise in the short term, I mean: what is right for the global economy as a whole? What is right for multilateralism and multilateral processes and institutions? What is right not just for us in Europe, but for developing countries? There are very many different sorts, sizes and states of development in developing countries, as I am finding out.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also considerable public interest in this round. I am grateful to Bob Geldof for giving out my email address, which has now clocked up something approaching 100 000 messages from members of the public wishing me well at Hong Kong. I am sure that he did so in the best possible spirit. I know that those who have been speaking this afternoon speak for and reflect that public opinion. I greatly welcome and value the joint parliamentary resolution on the Doha Round which has been put together. I take it as a strong signal of support for the Commission and my approach in the round. I have always welcomed the guidance and wisdom of the European Parliament and will continue to do so at Hong Kong and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that my fellow countryman, Mr Farage, has not remained in the Chamber. Well, he has a very pressing diary with many engagements. Unfortunately, in his hatred of all things European, he got slightly carried away with his description and praise of the US agricultural offer that has been tabled. At first sight, the US market access offer is indeed ambitious. But it also tactical and highly unrealistic, as I suspect they know. On domestic support, the US offer – which I strongly welcomed at the time and continue to do so – is far from being as ambitious as it seemed. It presents no real cuts in actual levels of spending. It brings down the <span class="italic">ceilings</span> of spending, but that is not, of course, quite the same thing. When it comes to its main domestic support programme, its counter cyclical payments, those remain untouched by the proposals that the United States has tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">On export competition the United States is very ambitious: very ambitious with our export subsidies, not quite so ambitious when it comes to its own export credits and its own food aid. However, I am sure it is only a matter of time before the US offer is improved and I look forward to that negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture, however, is very important to get right in this round. The Uruguay Round made limited inroads into agricultural protection. Inevitably, therefore, agriculture is a focus of the Doha Round. But let us not overlook the fact that the biggest welfare gains for all developing countries will come from liberalisation, not of agriculture, but in industrial goods, which account for 75% of developing countries’ trade and most of the tariffs that they pay. That is why this must not be an agriculture-only round. It must be balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Désir was right about agricultural liberalisation. Of course agricultural liberalisation will benefit some developing countries. The highly competitive agricultural exporters in the developing world, like Brazil and Argentina, are the developing countries that will be the chief beneficiaries. But the biggest winners in most agricultural liberalisation scenarios would be in the developed world, not the developing world, including large agricultural exporters such as Australia and New Zealand. That is not me speaking, that is the World Bank speaking in its recent publication.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make two last points about non-agricultural market access and services. In NAMA I want to give an assurance to honourable Members that we are certainly not asking from developing countries what we are prepared to do for and give ourselves. The principle of less than full reciprocity is important; it means commitments according to capacity and we shall certainly uphold that.</p>
<p class="contents">On services, the EU does not impose trade liberalisation on developing countries. We offer a free choice of sectors for developing countries. There is no pressure to open sectors such as education, health or water, although, in the case of water, I think many would benefit from such an advance. It is simply not the case that we are imposing overnight liberalisation; transition periods for developing countries would be of their own choice. We will not be proposing liberalisation of audiovisual services.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of sugar, I think that Mrs Kinnock was right in her description of the anger amongst ACP countries. There is indeed a virtual EUR 40 million offer on the table and I was not right in saying, as I had been advised this morning, that this figure had been agreed with ACP countries. There is certainly a marked imbalance between what is on offer in the sugar action programme to ACP countries and what we are offering to our domestic sugar producers. Before we reach final conclusions on this, we need to think through the implications of what we are offering. But clearly, on the question of budgetary allocation, we look to the Council and Parliament, as there are conflicting views and voices in this matter in both the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as far as our transparency with the European Parliament in Hong Kong is concerned, we will keep in close touch with the European Parliament Members who are there. They will participate at meetings at the interparliamentary conference that will take place in Hong Kong. I look forward to regular daily contact with parliamentarians, so that together we get this meeting right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ambitions that he expresses – or rather, those laid down in the negotiating mandate – are identical to those that the captains of industry trotted out yet again in their statement of 21 November, which called for greater liberalisation in agriculture and in access to the market for industrial products and services, and offered guarantees that the round of talks will be concluded by the end of 2006. This liberalisation has only served to exacerbate inequality, a fact confirmed in the latest United Nations Development Programme report.</p>
