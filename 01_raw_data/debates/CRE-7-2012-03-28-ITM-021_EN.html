<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rui Tavares, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, sometimes we have to remind ourselves where we came from. If we look at the history of international law on refugees, we see that founding the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in 1949, signing the Geneva Convention on refugees in 1951 and the first great effort to resettle refugees, which followed the 1956 revolution in Hungary, were targeted, all of them, at European refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, Europe was the continent of refugees. We Europeans often forget that was the case today when we see refugees arriving from the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to think about the world in which we live. Refugees are the most vulnerable people in the world. Of the several million refugees that exist, the majority want to return home, to their country of origin. Some of them could stay in transit countries with which they sometimes have a cultural or linguistic affinity. However, a small proportion of refugees – estimated at around 200 000 per year by the UNHCR – can neither return home, where their lives would be at risk, nor stay where they are, in countries that are often not signatories of the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">They need, therefore, to be given access to a new life in a third country. Resettling refugees is a global, orderly and peaceful effort, in which we should all play our part, and Europe should play its part precisely because it remembers where it came from and its history. Europe currently resettles around 5 000 refugees per year, compared with around 100 000 who are resettled by other countries: the United States, mainly, Canada, Australia, or even new players such as Brazil or Chile. There is a need, then, to get to work, and we have been doing so in recent years. The codecision on the European Refugee Fund (ERF), which we voted on in this House now almost two years ago, introduces new humanitarian priorities with clearer categories; strategic priorities in the European Union’s neighbouring countries, where we could act to resolve critical humanitarian emergencies. It also introduces modulation between the support given to the Member States, so that we can attract all 27 Member States, since only 10 resettled refugees when we started this process and there are now 13 that want to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">The journey between two years ago and now, from its start under the Swedish Presidency to its conclusion under the Danish Presidency, has not been easy. During these several presidencies, there have been several obstacles and several moments of anguish in which lives were lost and people waited in refugee camps for longer than we would have wished.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view and, I believe, that of the European public and of many people in this House and the institutions, this is no way to make laws in life-and-death situations. There is a need, beyond the Treaty of Lisbon, which introduced the codecision procedure, for an interinstitutional agreement delivering clear timetables for making this kind of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot delay two years in life-and-death situations. I must therefore thank the Danish Presidency, which has enabled us to conclude this process, on its activity and on the hard work it has done on this dossier; all the more so because Denmark has an opt-out in these areas, so it does not have access to monies from the ERF. It was disinterested work, noble work; as was, in fact, the majority of the work done in Parliament itself too. It is not going too far to remind you that it is not refugees who vote for the Members of this House, who pay your salaries with their taxes or who lead our political parties. However, from Greek Communists to UK Conservatives, there has been a huge alliance to bring this dossier to a good conclusion, for which I am very grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by reminding you of the Commission itself, where the process was started. To represent the many Commission officials, I should like to mention a person who worked on this dossier for two years and unfortunately passed away when agreement had already been reached but before it was adopted here: our colleague and friend Stefania Pasquetti, whose work, like the work of many people who worked on this dossier, will live on as long as we are able to resettle one more family of refugees; to double or triple the number of refugees settled in the world.</p>

It has, as the rapporteur has said, been a long journey to where we stand today, and I would like to thank Mr Tavares for his commitment, his endeavours and his hard work to finally achieve a result in this dossier. I would also like to thank all the presidencies that have been involved, and the Danish Presidency that has now brought it to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have worked on this and thank you, Mr Tavares, for mentioning Stefania Pasquetti. She and many others at the Commission did a lot of work and she was very committed. As you said, she very tragically died unexpectedly a few weeks ago. She would have been very happy today to see that we have finally reached an agreement between the three institutions, with overwhelming support from the European Parliament. I would like this to be a tribute to her work.</p>
<p class="contents">When we proposed the establishment of the programme back in 2009, our aim was to make sure that more refugees in situations of extreme vulnerability could be given more stable lives by resettling them in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed not only to increase refugee resettlement to the EU, but also to use and to pool our resources in a more strategic way. In order to achieve this, increased funding was offered to Member States new to resettling refugees. We also had the idea of annual selection of resettlement priorities. This was intended to widen the scope of refugees that could be resettled under the European Refugee Fund. In this way more people can be given the possibility to have a life in dignity and safety, offering them a future in which they can live rather than merely survive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am so proud and happy that today we have managed to overcome all the differences in a spirit of good compromise and to see our work on this file completed. Today’s legislation runs to the end of 2013, but the new asylum and migration fund that we have proposed for the coming financial perspective, 2014 to 2020, includes a reinforced and ambitious resettlement component.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in line with the suggestions made by the European Parliament, we are working this year on the implementation of a pilot project on resettlement in emergency situations which allows for even more resettlement to take place in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we had to overcome a last-minute snag in the legislative negotiations on the legal basis for the proposal, so I would like to read out a specific declaration on this issue by the Commission: ‘The Commission, in a spirit of compromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of the proposal, supports the final text; however, it notes that this is without prejudice to its right of initiative with regard to the choice of legal bases, in particular in reference to the future use of Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.’</p>
<p class="contents">By establishing this programme, we are sending a very strong signal to the international community that the European Union recognises the need for more resettlement of refugees and of our commitment to give shelter and protection and a durable solution for refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you all for your work on this; I am looking forward to a very strong endorsement in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks also to the Commissioner, for everything he has told us today. We are all delighted that, after so much debate here in plenary, we have now completed efforts and negotiations on this refugee resettlement programme. I too would remind the House that it is important for us to provide more incentives for the Member States to get involved in the programme and that it is very important for us to increase the contribution made by Europe in meeting the needs of all these people, who number approximately 200 000 a year at global level and who need a new country for reasons that we are all aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, to make the following observations: it does not do honour to any of us that, while all these events were unfolding in North Africa, we took so long to adopt our final decisions, for reasons that we are all aware of. Nor does it do honour to any of us that all these negotiations, that lasted over two years, ultimately resulted in a programme that will only be applied for one year in 2013. We need to at least try, in the next period, to make the best possible use of these data. In the next programme, in the next financial period, we need to make use of this year, we need to evaluate it quickly, we need to see its pros and cons, so that we can lay the foundations, the cornerstone, for further efforts on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened very carefully to the Commissioner’s statement. That statement proves that we shall have to engage in very important negotiations over the time remaining. We must not delay those negotiations. We all supported this programme right from the start. Also, we have all said that this programme should be combined with the internal resettlement or reallocation programme in Europe and that is something that we all expect to be working on in the current period. My congratulations, therefore, once again and let us hope that the application of this programme next year will be the starting point for much more important work by Europe in this sector in coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unknown cruelties in protracted wars, the growing influence of Islam. There is a lot to flee from. The Dutch Freedom Party is in favour of these refugees being accommodated in their own region. In that case, both the physical distance and the cultural distance are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the Convention on Refugees states that refugees should apply for asylum in the first safe country. I would also point out that the Convention on Refugees states that refugees should apply for asylum in the first safe country. That way, the uprooting which occurs when someone flees is as limited as possible and the process of integration – necessary if return is not possible – is thereby helped.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, now we are talking about the resettlement of refugees. It is a foolish plan to resettle in the EU, for example, Afghan refugees in Turkey or Somali refugees in Ethiopia. Brussels even wants to pick up the bill for this, and that payment, Mr President, is a mistaken kind of encouragement. Not only will it nowhere near cover the costs, but that money could be much better and much more effectively spent in the regions where these refugees are received. And that, Mr President, ensures better help for even more refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First and foremost because, for the first time ever, we will have a programme operating on a European level through which we will be able to resettle or transfer refugees from countries outside the European Union to countries of the European Union. This programme will also be providing financial aid to countries which are willing to accept refugees from outside the European Union. The United States, for example, have implemented a similar programme which is achieving very good results and has proven itself to be highly effective. Through this programme, the United States are able to provide help to people requiring international protection. This is a noble gesture, and we will be organizing and encouraging a similar effort on a European level, as necessary. In July last year, the Parliamentary delegation to the border between Libya and Tunisia which I was leading came across 5000 people who were forced to live in tents in Xuxa after fleeing from the conflict taking place in Libya. These people were mainly from countries like Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan, and they had to flee Libya although they did not have any other place to go to. These refugees could have easily qualified for transfers under the programme which we will be adopting today. The second reason why I will be supporting this programme is that such an initiative will give these refugees the chance to enter Europe without having to pay criminal organisations in order to board boats and cross the Mediterranean Sea, and without having to risk their lives in the process. Therefore, this programme will allow us to fight organised crime and reduce the number of deaths occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, since it will allow the direct transfer of refugees to any European country willing to accept them. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is all the more fitting, therefore, to acknowledge and celebrate this successful institutional cooperation. It has involved the Swedish Presidency, under which the proposal was put forward, the Danish Presidency, under which it is now being completed, the work of the Commission, and, of course, the perseverance of the European Parliament, which has been the driving force behind this report from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which I chair.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to commend it, as I also want to commend the persistence of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in drawing attention to the fact that the European Union is a union of values, and it sends out a positive message, not only to the countries of southern rim of the Mediterranean, but also to those on the eastern Eurasian border of the European Union, saying that we are committed to protecting refugees fleeing persecution in their countries of origin, or to those who are taking another complementary protection status, and who cannot, however, be taken in by the first country of entry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the purpose of this fund, and furthermore, it has been achieved without being delayed by the already drawn out legal discussions on the procedure, the delegated acts, and also the legal basis itself. I am pleased to announce that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has unanimously supported the adoption of Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as the legal basis, which invites us to base everything on the principle of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to say that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs not only voted almost unanimously to adopt this report, but also paid tribute to the memory of Ms Pasquetti, who worked for the European Commission, and to offer condolences and acknowledgement of her contribution, given that she passed away prior to the completion of this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We commend the improvement in reception conditions, the use of asylum procedures and the promotion of good and effective practices to ensure that people’s rights are protected in the international domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the fact that there were 301 000 asylum applications last year, of which 59 465 were accepted, we must streamline resettlement measures in the interest of maximising the efficiency of the services supplied.</p>
<p class="contents">Five thousand resettlements in Europe is still very small in solidarity terms. I also went to Shusha.</p>
<p class="contents">Far more Member States are going to have to involve themselves in resettlement, and therefore, we support the provision of additional financial support for those making the effort for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the need to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of people from specific geographical regions and nationalities once this has been decided as the most appropriate way of responding to their specific needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency and priority of Member State support should not be forgotten when it comes to children and women from specific risk groups, the victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence, as well as the victims of exploitation.

However, I should like to welcome today the adoption of this European resettlement programme. This is a joint programme which I and, indeed, we all hope will strengthen the participation of Member States in global resettlement – we should not forget that resettlement has a global dimension – and also improve the quality of the identification, reception and integration procedures which have been introduced. This programme also means that there will not be an excessive impact on the European Refugee Fund on a permanent basis, even though time is short at present. Finally, this programme will allow the European Union to be conspicuously silent no longer in the face of situations of humanitarian crisis, as was the case for the reception of refugees from Libya. However, I shall say more about this shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, it is also time to look ahead, to look to the future. The time for grand statements is past. We must waste no time in fleshing out and giving substance to this European resettlement programme and in thinking about how, in practice, we can work together with the Member States and the other main stakeholders in resettlement activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to welcome an existing programme: the resettlement pilot project launched on the initiative of the European Parliament, which, very innovatively and based on exchange of practices, has enabled the creation of a European resettlement network engaging cities and regions. Although national authorities are responsible for the selection of resettled refugees, regional and local authorities play a central role in reception and integration once refugees have arrived. The success of national resettlement programmes also heavily depends on the commitment, ability and partnerships of cities, municipalities and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another issue where we must take practical action: the full and effective introduction of resettlement programmes. It should indeed be noted that, according to the information we have, there has been a significant fall in the number of effective departures of refugees accepted for this resettlement, and this trend is the result of very meticulous security checks and various problems relating to the management of resettlement procedures. It should therefore be remembered, in this context, that many States are using the saturation of their capacity to receive refugees as an excuse for abandoning resettlement policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted yet again that these national or transnational projects have, on the contrary, enabled reception and integration conditions to be offered to the resettled refugees and that this, to a certain extent, relieves pressure on reception structures and allows the resettled refugees to become independent quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take advantage of the short time remaining to me, Mr President, to return to what Mr Díaz de Mera and Mr Busuttil were saying, although unfortunately they have left the room. I too was in Choucha, and indeed this is not a question of programmes, nor of money, but of human beings. We were in Choucha a few weeks ago and unfortunately it is highly likely that many of the people who were there then are still there, which goes to show, and Ms Malmström is aware of this, that there is room for a great deal more action on conditions so that offers are made to receive those people who are genuinely in need of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The process has been too long, owing to the inexplicable deadlock in the Council. This agreement has already been applauded by Mr Coelho from my party. It is inexplicable, particularly for the thousands of refugees living through humanitarian tragedy; waiting in camps, the majority of which are in chaos, under sub-human conditions and running the risk of feeding human-trafficking networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics show the urgency of the situation: there was a 15% increase in 2011 compared with the previous year. The 27 EU Member States as a whole received around 280 000 applications for asylum. The European Refugee Fund should deliver funding for actions in the interests of the European Union as a whole, but also actions at international or merely national level, with a view to creating a joint European Union resettlement programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The reception and protection systems of a number of Member States have been drastically put to the test, owing to the unexpected arrival of a large number of people requiring international protection, particularly from countries like Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Côte d’Ivoire. It is therefore crucial that the Member States be able to make use of EU funds to improve their reception systems and to encourage resettlement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are of the opinion that joint resettlement is a great opportunity of redemption for many desperate people looking for protection, people who come from extremely difficult situations and who deserve a willingness on our part that is not just formal but tangible and substantive. There must be a responsible contribution from Member States, given that this is on a voluntary basis. Eurostat has in recent days announced the data: over 300,000 applications. I am pleased to note that the country that ranks first in accepting applications for humanitarian protection is Italy, a country which once again needs the constructive backing of the European Union because, as you will know, landings in Lampedusa have started again on a massive and significant scale.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Government must do a lot, but this tangible backing from the European Union also needs to be there. We are of course opposed to illegal migratory flows, which must be firmly opposed because they are often in the hands of organised crime syndicates, and we are looking at a time period of 2013, and then at 2014-2020, in order to ensure that resettlement programmes may become a real and tangible goal. We would like to acknowledge the rapporteur, on the one hand, and Commissioner Malmström, on the other, for working so hard on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Resettlement – as we all know – is the last hope for many people in this world who can never return to their homes; people who are traumatised and suffering from the effects of war and other things. Other countries in the world, such as the United States, already resettle quite substantial numbers, at least when compared with EU Member States which do not resettle very many people. I hope that the resettlement programme will change this. Finally, we – as the EU – are encouraging Member States to take the step, but that still means that they have to take it themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Council to encourage Member States to take up this initiative and really resettle substantial numbers of people. We have the ‘Save Me’ campaign at a local level. Many communities in the European Union have said ‘yes, we want to have people here in our community.’ So please, Council, do part of the job and resettle some. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should now like to say a few words about the future of the programme for resettling refugees in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to see that the next financial perspective of the European Union, proposed by the Commission, adopted the majority of the ideas that we have been discussing in recent years: modulation between Member States so as to encourage more Member States to resettle refugees, the creation of a resettlement unit in the European Asylum Support Office and, I would say, the inclusion of some intelligence and sensitivity in resettlement policies, which cannot be solely based on a budgetary fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, moreover, I fully support the Commission’s use of Article 80 on solidarity as the legal basis. We consider it unacceptable that certain Member States in the Council did not want Article 80 cited as the legal basis for this type of instrument. Should we, in the end, be asking who in the European Union is afraid of solidarity?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now use the minute remaining to me to ask the public too to play their part: firstly, they should persuade the Member States to resettle refugees by telling them that now there is money for resettlement, that there are new rules, and that there is EU-level aid for doing things that would be expensive individually but are cheaper when done together. Secondly, they should support NGOs working in this area and the UN Refugee Agency. I would also ask them to find out more about how laws are made in the European Union and do something about this co-indecision process, under which there is so often deadlock over European law between Parliament and the Council. Without deadlines, a codecision is not a codecision, it is simply an excuse for using a stealth veto. Finally, they should remember that, as we Europeans have been so many times in our history, a refugee is a normal person in very difficult circumstances; it is someone who has already risked their life when they were thrown out of their house. We will not allow that to happen again, or even worse allow them to fall into the hands of human traffickers. Please, help us too to complete our work and to double or triple the number of refugees resettled in the European Union soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasingly people in the UK highlight immigration as one of the most pressing political issues, yet the EU fails to democratically recognise their voice. The UK population has grown faster in the last decade than at any other time, with the majority of growth related to immigration and an increased birth rate as a result of second generation immigration. It is essential that the relevant UK authorities retain the power to determine who lives in the country, which people are entitled to welfare payments and what checks and conditions are used to determine legal residency. This can only be done by leaving the EU. The report fails to examine issues that relate to the free movement principle, such as stress on employment, pressures upon society and integration issues. The EU is happy to publicly condemn, rather than condone, overt dialogue on the negative aspects of free movement of people while they continue to forge policies that underscore the ideal of a federal superstate where national values would be replaced by Brussels’ ideology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This last aspect of solidarity is probably the most problematic because we are not only witnessing an erosion of this solidarity in the EU, but also in relation with international partners, especially in terms of international protection. The General Programme on Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows is part of the EU’s response to this erosion of solidarity and for this reason it should be supported. The European Union should support Member States that show willingness to become more involved in helping refugees who need to be granted protection by the EU. Meanwhile, it is important to manage refugee programmes and resettlement programmes according to certain well-defined priorities, the most important of which is targeting the most vulnerable persons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every clever businessman knows that good products need no advertising. The precise nature of the EU’s error is made implicitly clear when it comes to the subject of expanding the resettlement programme. It lies in the discrepancy between the everyday reality for the citizens of the older EU Member States at least and the pathological mania for reorganisation shared by many eurocrats. Despite the huge integration problems experienced by many immigrants from completely different cultural backgrounds, resettlement programmes are to be expanded and granted even more funding. Anyone looking to bring refugees from safe third countries into the EU is showing their stupidity rather than their solidarity. The most effective assistance would be to provide third states that take in refugees with both financial and structural support and to back projects that promote peace and democracy, as well as humanitarian causes, in particular in crisis regions. The crazy idea that it is possible to offer every displaced person in the world a cosy refuge in the EU is simply self-destructive. Long-term assistance can only be provided in the third countries themselves. The concept of aid for refugees is being taken to absurd lengths by permanently identifying certain groups as victims of persecution and pursuing this policy of resettlement. Anyone forced to leave their homeland because of the horror of war must be able to find sanctuary in a safe country. However, this should not involve permanent resettlement with a guarantee of generous financial support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
