At that time we took a number of initiatives which we believed would help children, the most vulnerable section of our society. Mostly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">They did not, in general, relate to matters concerned with the Internet – this new technology, which has come in at an enormous pace in the last few years; a new technology which has the ability to do good things but also the ability to do evil things. There are very few regulations which are concerned with what the Internet is used for. Whilst a lot of countries are keen to see their citizens benefit from the good things it can offer and whilst <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce itself is becoming a major feature of life, we have not yet seen any proper regulations to protect those who are abused, and particularly those who are abused by the use of images of themselves in a pornographic manner.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason for my report – to protect children, to try and help children to avoid being abused in this particular manner. My report, for the first time, puts forward a definition. We have been short of a definition until now. Although there was an initial Austrian initiative, which this report supports, it did not contain a definition. In our report we have entered a definition which we hope will be acceptable internationally. We can only deal with this matter if we deal with it in an international fashion. We are only dealing with it at European level now, but hopefully the world will react, whether it be through the auspices of the United Nations once more or, indeed, through the common sense of other countries. If we are lucky, we will see a world approach to outlaw these very bad practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We have required within our report that European nation states should have action plans for dealing with the abuses which take place. We are concerned with the production, sale, distribution and deliberate possession of pornographic images showing children. We want to stamp out this appalling abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report we wish to make sure that police authorities throughout Europe take action to deal with these matters. We want to encourage and, indeed, in some circumstances, require nation states to look at their present laws, to make sure that they are able to investigate these abuses and bring people who abuse children in this way before the appropriate courts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a difficult task, not only in regard to the definition which we have decided to offer, but also because so many countries have different attitudes as to what, for instance, is a child. We have tried to reach a compromise in our deliberations. I believe that we have managed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to offer my thanks, as rapporteur, to all those who have been concerned, not only on my own committee – the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – but also on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport as well. We have had nothing but positive contributions. In my own committee this report was adopted with 27 votes in favour and one abstention. That I regard as very helpful and a good sign for the future. Because of all the support for this initiative, both within the committees and from public reaction, I am very hopeful that once it has been considered by Parliament it will be taken up and put into effect and will assist in protecting that vulnerable section of society that needs protection in this fast-moving and growing area of new technology.</p>

Measures at transnational level are required, especially due to the denationalised nature of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, for his most excellent report. In this regard, it is perhaps particularly pleasing that it is from Great Britain that Mr Kirkhope comes. It is good that he has defined child pornography, and I believe we have arrived at a satisfactory compromise. It is particularly good that Mr Kirkhope has also stated that everything that has the appearance of being child pornography shall also be included under this definition.</p>
<p class="contents">Contact points or special units shall be set up in the Member States according to the draft. This will hopefully lead to better investigations. There is a need for more expertise in this area if it is to be possible to carry out professional investigations. Europol will be involved, as will the candidate countries. It is a good thing that crime in third countries will be punished in accordance with national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of “children” – that is, the age up until which a person is to be considered a child – has been formulated in order to show that we want to create the most effective level of protection where child pornography is concerned. Our line of argument allows for flexibility in defining the age-limit that strikes the hardest blow to child pornography. It is a question of creating the most effective protection for children so that they are able to hold on to the childhood that they are entitled to. All children should have the right to a childhood! That ought to be a basic human right.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council Decision to combat child pornography on the Internet will place an obligation on the Member States, and <span class="italic">obligation </span>is the crucial word here, to take measures to combat child pornography on the Internet. This obligation must have legal implications.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the Internet is obvious to us all. It has come to be indispensable as a modern communication tool. We need it for exchanging information, for learning and for all sorts of operations. However, increased use of the Internet also means increased access to violence and pornography, not least child pornography. Children themselves have access to violence on the Internet, which must be objectionable to us all. Parents are powerless in the face of this phenomenon because they cannot keep up with this technological progress. We are extremely concerned, especially in the new MEDIA 2000 programme which is being drawn up, as to how we should deal with this problem in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, an urgent need has arisen to combat child pornography on the Internet effectively. This requires efficient software to determine the country of origin, to trace the images and to catch the perpetrators and those producing the images. This in turn requires extremely advanced technology. We need specialists who can develop access codes, which will also necessitate certain restrictions being placed on media freedom. We need to network all the relevant organisations, the welfare organisations and NGOs, to facilitate rapid action and effective procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget one thing: the main reason why children are forced into this is poverty. We must combat poverty and intolerance and take this as our starting point. This is the key to prevention. It means that we must understand the children, but also that we must protect the victims, offer them assistance in reintegrating and help them to rediscover a normal life. We must not, therefore, simply act in a preventative fashion; we must offer long-term help to those children affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The attention that has been paid to this issue has increased considerably in all Member States. Nevertheless, at European Union level, even though children represent around one fifth of the Union’s population, specific attention is very rarely paid to their needs in economic policies and in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of children all over the world suffer serious and systematic violations of their fundamental rights, from domestic cruelty, which goes undetected and unpunished, and the economic exploitation of their labour, which robs them of their childhood and education, to their use in war; from being forced to play the horrific role of child-soldier to their use in prostitution or pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the estimates of the Economic and Social Committee, there are more than five million children working in Europe. Most of these children work in areas such as pornography, drug trafficking, child pornography and sexual tourism. These children are in particular need of society’s protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The evolution of the Internet, its incredibly rapid development and its importance today raise the question of its use for these reprehensible purposes. In the last part-session, here in Strasbourg, we discussed what needs to be done about the Internet. The European Union’s desire is to make more rapid progress in terms of e-commerce and to make a firmer commitment to the new technologies and to education.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have been discussing what we need to prevent and combat, and that is the circulation and distribution of child pornography, which has been increasing at an alarming rate. And although it may be true that we have to encourage web-site administrators and service providers to define their standards of conduct and to regulate themselves, and encourage Internet users to inform the authorities whenever they discover child pornography, it is nevertheless true that Union and national law bear some responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kirkhope’s excellent report makes it very clear how much we still have to do and where we need to improve, in terms of establishing specialist units, strengthening cooperation and exchanges between States, in terms of Europol’s activities and the efficiency of Member States’ actions, including, where necessary, the revision of their own legislation and the procedures in force in these areas so that we can guarantee the effective imposition of criminal sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the responsibility of the Union itself is concerned, I am delighted at the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights that is being drawn up considers the specific rights of children, and takes account of the areas in which the Union can provide considerable impetus, specifically in these matters.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These events are occurring every day, every hour and perhaps every minute. The perpetrators are using the most up-to-date technology to distribute their material and in the Internet they have found a medium which is more suited than any other to acting anonymously. Paedophiles are limited only by their own technical capability or the equipment which they can afford. When seen against its virtually unlimited potential, society and the state have thus far had very little at their disposal to counter illegal activity on the Internet, in particular since cyberspace has no states or geographical and political borders and its alluring feature is its worldwide accessibility. The Internet itself cannot commit crimes. What is criminal is the behaviour of some 3 to 5% of Internet users who misuse the Net for illegal purposes. 95 to 97% of the Internet is legal. The Internet is therefore a reflection of society as a whole. Just as in the real world, crime is very much a part of the virtual world.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, the Internet is not beyond the law. The problem of crime on the Internet cannot be resolved by any state in isolation. For this we need uniform worldwide crimes and definitions so that law enforcement authorities can work together in global terms and not in opposition. In the area of child pornography in particular, where the rights of children are continually being trampled underfoot, there is an urgent need for global regulation. The EU has already taken several measures towards this, which I will not go into any further here. I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report. It is a high-quality text.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, to effectively combat child pornography, it is necessary, in my opinion, for Europol to be immediately informed of cases of child pornography and for the exchange of information with the competent authorities to be carried out quickly and directly, as stated in Amendment No 20 from Gerhard Schmid.</p>
<p class="contents">All the proposed measures are suitable and necessary to effectively combat child pornography. However, we must not forget that, in addition to the technological and police measures, we must also combat poverty, ignorance and prejudice in order to improve society’s image of children and children’s image of themselves and to offer help to the victims; thus far, victim support has played too insignificant a role. We need a social climate in which the victims of vile crimes are not left to fend for themselves whilst the perpetrators are shielded through failure to act and fear of embarrassing revelations.</p>

There is no doubt in anybody’s mind: the physical and emotional integrity of children and the protection of victims of sexual crimes are of fundamental importance and must lie at the heart of the Union's concerns. Despite earlier initiatives by the Commission and Parliament, the misuse of the Internet and its harmful and illegal content have only increased, and it is time and again apparent how difficult it is to combat child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly needs to be done in order to combat child pornography effectively, especially on the Internet? First of all, we need to set up an easily accessible and recognisable contact point. In fact, the Netherlands was the first country to set up such a contact point back in 1996, on the initiative of the Internet providers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for the purposes of enforcement, police forces and the judiciary need more expertise regarding the Internet and ancillary digital technology. This is simply lacking. Officials need to be trained well, otherwise they will be unable to combat child pornography effectively. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the penalties must be harmonised in Europe and must be increased. If not, the Internet will remain a threat and it will never be the challenge which it could be.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, his name fills us with hope. Mr Kirkhope’s document has lifted the lid on a great deal – a great deal of child suffering and human suffering. We are delighted that there is now a definition at long last. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, that this phenomenon must be increasingly brought into the open and binding measures must be drafted. This includes setting up contact points, such as those in Belgium and the Netherlands, and also in the other EU Member States and candidate countries. After all, there is quite obviously a correlation between child pornography on the Internet and trafficking in children. This correlation is evident in the countries of origin, the transit countries and the host countries in the European Union. This is also borne out by the studies carried out by police forces in this field with regard to under-age asylum seekers. They disappear on their own, or even accompanied, from asylum centres and reappear within the world of prostitution. This correlation is also evident in the case of possibly kidnapped and missing children. Recently, mothers recognised their own children on a porn website which could be viewed at police stations in France. We also know that details of people’s identity are used or misused by people with connections in the world of child porn websites. In order to conceal their own identity, they use the bank details of others. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to stamp out child pornography, we need a multi-disciplinary approach. The police and criminal investigation services must be able to do their jobs well. This means that the politicians need to ensure that the police can do its job effectively. The police within the European Union work differently from the police in some candidate countries, as other MEPs have already pointed out. Politicians too should believe that child pornography exists on the Internet. The NGOs are doing a great job. To finish off, I would like to point out that some pimps use the Internet to distribute photographs of young people engaged in prostitution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I support the action stipulated by the report, and I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, I still think the proposed measures do not match up to the scale of the problem before us. Communication technologies transform data. The Internet thus has formative and demultiplying effects on the trade and traffic in child pornography. This trafficking is on a scale hitherto unknown in terms of its extent and the geographical areas covered. It is an urgent state of affairs, and specific action must be proposed in order to deal with the networks that exist. In all the States of the Union, individual paedophile acts are suppressed, but ignorance and inefficiency still reign in the suppression of networks. What we have to deal with here are ephemeral, evolving sites, which adapt constantly and which are complicated to monitor. This state of affairs makes it essential to draw up a survey of paedophile networks within the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of these networks confirms the need for a common judicial area. Once again, the rapporteur urges the Union to approach the Member States, and ask them to make an effort to harmonise their national legislation in this area. I share his opinion but, given the cross-border nature of the problem, the response must be at Union level. The common judicial area does exist with Europol, Schengen and Eurodac. Let it be noted that it is used primarily, and indeed exclusively, to control the flow of migration and to suppress illegal immigration. But even if action was undertaken in each Member State to create specialised units working in liaison, as the report advocates, that would not solve the problem of the networks because their work would still be restricted by national borders. There is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography, who are often repeat offenders. What is needed is prevention, in order to counter their activities and to dismantle their networks. The European Union must provide itself with a suitable structure, a European instrument to enforce information exchange and action. This instrument must be such as to make it possible to address States directly in order to urge them to pass on information, but also to issue orders so that the networks can be dismantled. The Union should be in a position to apply penalties to any State which does not fulfil its criminal law obligations in the matter of combating paedophilia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dutch police have drawn up a file of several hundred children from a CD-ROM containing 10 000 images or sequences of child pornography available on the Internet. Interpol has acknowledged having a file of 800 photos. Why are these valuable documents not used? Who are these children and what is being done to locate them? If there are records of offenders, it must be possible to keep records of victims. It is our duty, ethically, as human beings, to do everything we can to find them.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons I think the European Union must make combating this form of crime a priority. Mr Kirkhope’s report is filled with good intentions, but further proposals must be made in order to deal with the present situation. I think the Commission and the Council should take action which is up to the task of dealing with the high stakes of this crime that affects thousands of innocents.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The action proposed by the Austrian Government is heading in the right direction, which is that of strengthening the prosecution of anyone deliberately producing, selling, disseminating or owning materials relating to the sexual exploitation of children. What, however, are we to think of the limited personnel and financial resources allocated at the present time to the police departments responsible for monitoring Internet networks, which are, by definition, worldwide ones?</p>
<p class="contents">To govern, however, means to make plans. And we have to investigate the deep-seated reasons for this scourge in order to attempt to find an effective cure for the problem. Admittedly, there is at root the unspeakable vice of certain parties, whose possible distress could never be any justification for these crimes, and the lure of easy profits for the producers and distributors of documents of this type. We must bring our attention to bear, however, on the economic poverty of the parents who are led to exploit their own children in order to survive, or the poverty of abandoned and defenceless children who have lost their points of reference, and think this is their only way out of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our society, and often this House, claims that the future of humanity is freedom without responsibility and rights without duties. This is an irresponsible attitude. We are now paying the price for this permissiveness which some parties have been championing as the way of progress for over thirty years, but what progress do we see, except progress in the loneliness of our peers, the broken families and the children left to fend for themselves who, almost naturally, turn to drug addiction, sexual promiscuity, sects and alcoholism.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for human dignity, as the Council decision rightly claims, first involves the uncompromising affirmation of the destructive nature of these abuses and also involves appropriate policies which, in Europe and in third countries, enable families to accommodate, educate and protect their children, and enable children to regain their essential points of reference, which are goodness, truth and beauty. The legitimately and ultimately repressive message of this report will only be heard and be useful if, at the same time, we clearly reassert the basis of a life-enhancing culture, a culture which respects life, applicable to all people in all places, and if, at Member State and Union level, we provide the practical resources necessary to achieve this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first phenomenon is the boom in pornography in general, and the second is, obviously, the exploitation of children for sexual purposes. I mention the boom in pornography in general because I do not think it is possible to isolate child pornography completely from the rest. The consumer experiences a phenomenon of habituation, if I can call it that, in the face of the incitements to pornography displayed on television, in hotel chains (and that includes here in Strasbourg or Brussels) or in all the magazines in view on shop shelves, and necessarily is driven ultimately to seek ever stronger stimuli, like a drug addict.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what happens, and that is why those people who, in France in 1987, for example, thought it right, in the name of freedom, to strenuously oppose the common-sense measure of removing pornographic magazines from display in newsagents’ shops, and keeping them under the counter, as it were, have to bear some responsibility for the measures which they are condemning today.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now I heard Mrs Ainardi, a left-wing Member of Parliament, complaining, for example, that a number of files have been compiled but are not used in any way for investigation or prosecution purposes, as they should be. I should simply like to remind my fellow Member that one of the very first measures on jurisdictional, judicial and police matters taken by the left-wing government in France was to order the destruction of the file on sexual perverts.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, therefore, be astonished that our society is in the position that it is in, and that child sex abuse is commonplace. Is this, though, not also the inevitable continuation of a number of measures which have already been taken? For example, in the area of trivialising homosexuality. I am well aware that not all child pornography necessarily...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... you see, you are proving the truth of what I am trying to say. Some of our fellow Members who are here condemning child pornography are also demanding, for example, that homosexual couples (indeed why should we limit it to couples?) should be able to adopt children. This is the total reversal of the idea of adoption, whereby adoption is no longer in the interests of the child adopted but only in the interests of the adopting adult. This is necessarily the first step on the road which leads ultimately to the deviancies of child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, I am well aware of Mr Schulz’s customary protests. They are not going to stop me asking whether this horrendous decline in moral standards is not also a continuation of the morality of the termination of unborn children? Why, when one is prepared to accept state-controlled hospitals organising terminations of unborn children, should one find it absolutely scandalous in moral terms to abuse children, once born, for the sexual pleasure of adults?</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say. Such practices have met with leniency, as we all know, within the Member States up to and including at the highest levels of their political classes. We therefore do not want a situation where you cannot see the wood for the trees. International cooperation is needed in this area, admittedly, as is Europol action, and why do we not extend Interpol’s mandate? If child pornography must be fought, however, then it must be fought as such, whatever the means of transmission! Whether by personal networks, by telephone, by Minitel, no one considers bringing back censorship or opening mail on the grounds that child pornography may also be sent by post. The Internet, Minitel, the post are nothing more than the medium. It is the originators we must combat. It is not the Internet itself which is to blame, but the child pornographers, and they must be punished severely. Everyone knows perfectly well that that is not the case today.</p>

It was important for it to be subjected to as few rules as possible. It has since become apparent that the Internet is merely a reflection of our society. In addition to a wealth of information and expertise, it also reflects the criminal underbelly of society, including child pornography. </p>
<p class="contents">The nature of the Internet is such that it has become easier to disseminate child pornography anonymously, rapidly and across national borders. This is a good reason to take action against this as a Union. Our children should be protected against this disrespectful exploitation, which reduces them to mere toys and leaves them damaged for the rest of their lives. I therefore welcome the Council’s current proposal and Mr Kirkhope’s report with open arms. </p>
<p class="contents">I do wonder, however, whether too much is not being asked of the Council through Parliament’s adding new elements to the description of the criminal offence of “child pornography”. Harmonising criminal law at European level is quite different from creating European criminal law. </p>
<p class="contents">Another difficult point is the age limit up to which pornography is considered child pornography. I myself am in favour of an age limit of 18, rather than 16, years. But the current compromise, in which both ages are mentioned without opting for one or the other, is confusing. I do not think that we can seriously expect the Council to adopt this text, but that does not detract from my appreciation of the work which the rapporteur and the Commission have put in.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter has preoccupied us for a long time, too long in my opinion. Its importance is demonstrated by the constantly increasing incidence of such delinquency. Nevertheless, irrespective of the importance of efficient law enforcement in this area, we must not depart from the principle of criminal-law liability and postulate strict liability. The report is therefore on the right track. In my opinion, the most urgent need is to create, as soon as possible, in all Member States and in the candidate countries, the legal and technological capability to search the contents of the Internet for child pornography.</p>

<p class="contents">The motivation for this initiative was clearly that all those who wish to make policy for the future must, on the one hand, have the courage to carry out necessary reforms and, on the other, must positively and effectively avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by technological and global development and human resources, all the while taking responsibility for pointing out risks and undesirable developments and for drawing the necessary boundaries. Anyone who does not take action against children and minors being abused and lead astray is jeopardising the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Austrian initiative was, as previous speakers have pointed out, to draw attention to the fact that the Internet, given its special nature, offers new and, in the light of its scope, not always positive, opportunities, indeed incredible opportunities for the distribution of child pornography. Pornographic material can be distributed via the Internet in unlimited amounts and by the most direct route. There is the danger that children themselves may surf the Internet and come across pornographic images of their peers, thereby sustaining psychological damage. Combating child pornography and the misuse of the Internet is, therefore, both a worldwide and a specifically European responsibility and we call upon all Member States to take action in light of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the debate on the age limit. However, I share the view of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that we should have fixed the age limit at 18 and I hope that the initiatives will lead to the highest possible age limit being set in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that there will be a uniform definition and I support all measures to also place providers under obligation since today’s discussion can only be the start of a debate and of initiatives and is far from the end. Actions must follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Gollnisch is a fascist delegate in this House who takes advantage of every opportunity, not least in this Chamber, to slander others. It is the left-wingers or the gays who are responsible for child pornography. He beautifully tars everyone with the same brush. The left-wing French Government is responsible for the abolition of the criminal register of sex offenders and is therefore responsible, in the logic of this arch-fascist, for child pornography. This is the type of poison which he spouts here. Then he slips away because the sole reason why this pack of hounds sits in this Parliament is to permanently set upon others and then slink back into its holes to evade the responsibility of debate. At any rate, these fine people do not participate in parliamentary work and it is time that this was made known because they are only ever speaking for the benefit of the visitors. Then it all sounds so wonderful. The reality is that these fine people do not partake in 99% of the work. They spout their poison and then push off.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I share the opinion of Mr Hager that we should also place an obligation on providers. I think this is a worthy point which Mr Kirkhope should take into consideration in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I also expressly support the view that we should not move away from criminal-law liability. It cannot be right to release from criminal-law liability one of the primary areas where human dignity is violated, particularly taking into account the special need to protect minors. I believe this must be made clear, even if it has sometimes been disputed by the groups on the left. On this point, Mr Hager is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment: the permanent availability of sexual material in the exclusively anonymous private sphere, which is conditioned by the structure of the Internet, and the attendant fact that sexual abuse is removed from public and, hence, social controls, is one of the central challenges with which we are faced as a result of this new aspect of human lifestyle. We cannot resolve it simply through Interpol and more stringent criminal law. The Internet, as evidenced by child pornography, presents totally new challenges to our subjective, individual sense of responsibility. We should discuss this in at least as much detail as the tightening of criminal law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The distribution of child pornography on the net is also a criminal offence, and so is making child pornography. Victims of paedophile activity are often facing lifelong trauma with some of them turning into child abusers themselves. The distribution of child pornography is facilitated by the Internet. Not only is the scale of distribution magnified, but there is a risk of the offence being trivialised. </p>
<p class="contents">Various MEPs have already spoken a good deal in the wake of this commendable report, commenting for example on how good and necessary it is that there should be contact points, that the police should have the relevant expertise and that there should be clear penalties. These are all points underlined by Mrs Plooij. But anyone who is at all familiar with this sordid subject matter knows that the contact points are inundated with information and that – in stark contrast with this – the number of people who analyse this information is very limited. I feel sorry for them, not only because of what they are witnesses to, but also because of the volume of material in respect of which they must feel powerless. We pretend that we are all agreed on this, but this is not so in practice. In actual fact, there is a great deal of resistance. Tourist areas, also within our own European Union, do not want to admit that poverty forces poor children into prostitution. The Internet has the aura of progress. And when it comes to harmonising our legislation at European level, reference is made to all kinds of grand legal principles. I think that whoever wills the end must also will the means.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Eriksson (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, It is good that we are having this debate on child pornography on the Internet. Apart from a few rather coarse, ignorant contributions from my opponent, what has been said has been very sensible. I would like to point out that, in actual fact, many paedophiles assault children that are close to them. It is not divorce, alcoholism or anything else that encourages this behaviour. It is fairly well known that being sexually aroused by children is not exactly normal behaviour, and for that we should be grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internet makes exchanging pictures easier, and it is this we should be discussing. I agree totally with Mrs Maes that we have excellent police authorities working with these issues. However, in relation to how the problem has increased, there are not enough of them to be able to examine the whole situation. It is, therefore, a shame that we are immediately about to call in Europol. We have had discussions with representatives from Europol with respect to trafficking in women and children, and they say that they have two reports. However, these reports are not official, so only Europol is aware of Europol's own activities. This is a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The police that I have been in contact with in my own country, Sweden, who are working on these issues via Interpol, need, of course, more support, just like their colleagues in other countries. For this is not only an issue within the EU. There is also much to do when it comes to Thailand, the Philippines and other places around the world, something the police authorities are working on. It is not exclusively in Western Europe that this issue is being dealt with. </p>
<p class="contents">There is one aspect of this matter that has not come up very often in the responses to this report, but which I would, nevertheless, like to raise in the debate, namely the rehabilitation of the victims. The problem with the Internet is that the pictures are so clear. Older children are at risk of being continuously pursued on the net and of being recognised for ever and a day. We must consider how we in the Member States are to take care of the children that have been victims of this crime and whose photographs are on the net.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden we have also had experience of people finding their way into the school system or child care because they are paedophiles. It is a shame that we have not discussed the enormous cutbacks and extensive privatisation in these areas. Of course, we must perhaps also ensure, as a preventative measure, that no-one works alone with children, either in the private or the public school systems or within the child care profession and in other positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly welcome this debate. However, I would like us to remember that paedophilia is not a common, widespread activity, a fact for which, as I have already said, we must be grateful.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only have the following points to add or raise with regard to this excellent report; firstly, the appropriate training of specialists to be able to also prosecute the perpetrators; secondly, the need for the capability to carry out legal proceedings at international level; and thirdly, the need to be able to punish crimes committed in third countries under domestic law.</p>

As long as there is a trade in pornography, the Internet will be used to carry it out, because the Internet offers an extra benefit, namely it masks the consumer and keeps the supplier, for the most part, in the shadows. However, as long as this demand exists, there will also be abused children scarred for life. I therefore welcome this initiative, which was finally put forward so comprehensively by the Austrian Presidency. Above all, I welcome the proposals for expanding the initiative which the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, has made. He has made a major contribution to the instrument, which the Member States can now take up, being more efficient than ever before. I would like to pick up on five points which seem to me to be particularly important in the fight against child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is that not only should the sale and distribution of child pornography be punishable, and indeed should incur punishments that will act as a deterrent, but that the possession of child pornography itself should also be punishable.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is the age limit. It cannot be set high enough. I therefore appeal that the target which the Committee has set itself, i.e. of establishing the age of 18 as standard at European level, be implemented as soon as possible. 16 is just the first step. The target must remain 18.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that we need experts in the fight against child pornography on the Internet. And it is even more important that these experts join forces, that they are coordinated, and here again Europol presents itself as the appropriate institution.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that the register of persons who have been convicted of the distribution of child pornography or of the sexual abuse of children will hopefully be implemented across Europe as quickly as possible and that access will be available to all Member States and Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that we should proceed according to the personality principle in order to punish criminal acts as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to appeal first of all to the individual responsibility of all those who use child pornography for their own gain. They are responsible for its being produced and for the harm it causes children. I would also like to appeal to the Member States, in the interests of the most vulnerable members of society, to implement as quickly and efficiently as possible the measures proposed by the rapporteur in his excellent report and by the Austrian initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context I would like to propose, in order once again to show the consequence of the proposals, a few follow-up measures, because it is not only e-mails which can be sent anonymously, but letters also. This is why all public post-boxes should be closed and it should only be possible to send letters at the post-office following official verification of ID.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns telephones, because telephone calls can also be made anonymously. All telephones should also be gotten rid of, except for a few telephone boxes which should, of course, be monitored by the police.

As has already been stressed, the aim is to intensify actions to prevent and combat the sexual abuse of children, with particular reference to the production, possession and distribution of child pornography through the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian initiative to reintroduce the draft joint action to combat child pornography on the Internet, on which Parliament has already delivered a favourable opinion, is welcomed by the Commission. One essential and positive aspect of the text is the encouragement of international cooperation, which is already well developed in other areas of the fight against criminal activities, such as drugs and illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Internet ignores national boundaries, those tracking down Internet crime must also be able to cross them. International cooperation therefore has to be encouraged as much as possible. The Commission has been closely involved in international activities and initiatives addressing this issue, such as the International Conference on combating child pornography on the Internet, which was held from 29 September to 1 October 1999 in Vienna. It was jointly organised by the Austrian and United States Governments and the Commission under the STOP Programme. The conference adopted conclusions and recommendations that are being actively followed up. The Commission therefore welcomes the fact that the draft decision underlines the need to engage law enforcement authorities and industry, especially Internet service providers, in a constructive dialogue aimed at improving mutual understanding and sharing respective experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear need to identify appropriate fora where law enforcement and industry's concerns can be addressed and to encourage the development and implementation of codes of conduct and best practice. We should bear in mind that the key role must be played by self-regulation and by the individual responsibility of those who use the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has long been concerned about child pornography on the Net. In order to fight against it, it proposed a multiannual Community action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks. The Council and Parliament adopted it on 25 January 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan provides support for concrete action in four areas: a European network of hotlines, self-regulation by industry, filtering, and rating and awareness. In addition, the Commission, and the Union as such, is involved in the work of the G8, creating a 24-hour points of contact network. It is also involved in the current negotiations on a draft convention on cyber crime in the framework of the Council of Europe that will address the specific problem of paedo-pornography on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the position expressed in the draft report that the subject of child pornography on the Internet should involve the approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States. We are convinced that agreements on common definitions, common charges and common sanctions need to be established for certain forms of crime. We have included in the scoreboard on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice a specific action aimed at criminalising the sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet, as called for by the Heads of States and Government at the Tampere European Summit. A proposal for a framework decision on common definitions, common charges and common sanctions will be put forward after the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will participate fully in the discussions that will take place in the Council with a view to adopting this draft decision in order to see whether further action should and would be needed. We welcome Parliament's proposal on a legal basis: as a framework decision it should be based on Article 34(2)b of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also consider, together with the Member States, how to support the implementation of the decision through other projects funded under the STOP programme. These could be aimed at promoting further training and exchanges between those responsible in the Member States for fighting against this phenomenon, such as the police authorities, but also the judiciary, and at close cooperation between those authorities, Europol and the future Eurojus network.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission wishes to indicate to Parliament that it can fully support all the amendments tabled by Mr Kirkhope and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, as they provide some very useful clarifications on the definitions and description of the activities to be criminalised, on the age limit, on the offence of possession and on the need for the law enforcement authorities, the police and the judiciary to adopt the necessary technological instruments to scan the net and to make the fight against paedo-pornography not just a rhetorical issue but a concrete action of the Union as such and of each and every Member State.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
