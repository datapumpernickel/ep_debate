<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in December 2001 the Commission adopted its Green Paper on the criminal-law protection of the financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Prosecutor. This provoked a broad debate among academics and practitioners beyond legal circles. That was also its intention and I would like to thank the Commission for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, too, got involved in the debate. Even before the Green Paper appeared, it called in several resolutions for better protection for EU finances through the establishment of a European prosecutor for financial matters, who would deal with the growing number of cases of cross-border crime affecting the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is ripe. The EU is on the threshold of enlargement, with ten new Member States acceding in the coming year. The Community budget will continue to grow, administration of European money will become even more complex. At the same time, cross-border crime will increase as modern technology makes it increasingly professional. The territorial fragmentation of criminal law systems and the difficulties in judicial cooperation between Member States are the reason why criminals are seldom caught and even more seldom convicted. The statistics show that the EU budget loses as much as EUR 1 000 million every year to internationally active organised criminals. It is possible that this money funds other criminal structures. Cigarette smuggling is the best example. European taxpayers’ money is lost for actual EU purposes. I repeat: lost, since even today we in Europe still do not have efficient structures for the prosecution of EU financial crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has recognised the danger in so far as it anchored the protection of financial interests in the first pillar of the Treaty of Maastricht and enshrined cooperation with the Commission in the Treaty of Amsterdam. With today’s report from the Committee on Budgetary Control, Parliament joins the 72 opinions that the Commission has so far received from various quarters and considered concerning the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Please note that our report is an own-initiative report, not a legislative one. We on the committee have taken time to make a thorough analysis of the subject of ‘establishing a European Prosecutor’; we commissioned experts to make external studies and arranged a hearing with the national parliaments and representatives of civil society. In this report, we are now putting forward options and calling on the Commission to make improvements, especially with regard to safeguarding basic rights and rights of defence, supervision of the European Public Prosecutor and his links with existing structures. We want links with the existing structures of OLAF, Eurojust and Europol. We want in that way to avoid duplication, but at the same time we want the Prosecutor to be an efficient instrument for the protection of EU finances at European level. There are clear proposals as to how the future European Prosecutor could cooperate with the national authorities in the Member States. The principle of subsidiarity is the maxim here. All the questions of how the Public Prosecutor’s Office should operate can then be settled by secondary law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to sincerely thank my colleagues from my committee, and also those from the Committees on Constitutional Affairs, Legal and Home Affairs and Petitions for their positive and constructive cooperation. Their proposals have been incorporated into this report. Our main concern is that an appropriate legal basis for the creation of this Public Prosecutor’s Office should be laid down in the Treaty and that the Council should appoint this new organ with the assent of Parliament. The revision of the treaties remains an essential prerequisite for this, because only a treaty reform can legitimise the proposal. We call on the European Convention to provide for this legal basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to protect the EU’s financial interests now so that it can be placed on the agenda for the 2004 intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the time is ripe. We want the means to be created in the European Union and for the European Union to strengthen and secure the protection of the Community’s financial interests before enlargement takes place. We all want an area of freedom, security and justice, where a stop is put to fraud and corruption at the expense of the EU budget and therefore of the European taxpayer.</p>

The issue of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud is an example of the problems, sluggishness and inadequacy of European Union integration. The scale and gravity of fraud prejudicial to Community financial interests is clear to all. Just as clear is the ineffectiveness of the efforts to combat this type of crime, which goes largely unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">The gravity of the situation was condemned by the European Parliament more than 12 years ago. Years of careful research have led to the drafting of a specific, feasible proposal for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud, governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, with a corollary of criminal-law and procedural arrangements capable of fairly resolving the majority of issues raised by the need for a centralised criminal-law initiative and for criminal judgments reserved for national judges. The legal basis for this institution was proposed by the Commission at the Nice intergovernmental conference which, unfortunately, here too, failed for want of a common desire on the part of the governments and a European perspective on the issues. The launch of intergovernmental judicial cooperation under Eurojust has created more ambitious and less realistic expectations, while it has also created excuses for further delays. The time for delays has passed: we must implement initiatives which ensure a uniform level of protection of citizens’ fundamental rights in criminal-law proceedings and minimum rules for the admissibility of evidence, and the Convention on the Future of Europe must propose a suitable legal basis in the European Constitution which is sufficiently flexible to allow the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud, capable, in the future, of evolving within the context of Eurojust with wider objectives relating to the fight against cross-border crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement will certainly not improve this situation, as it will further fragment the European judicial area, increase the number of administrative bodies involved in the management of Community funds and accordingly increase the risk of fraud. As we know, this fraud and crime are a long-standing concern of the European Parliament, and Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam gave the Community power to take effective and equivalent measures in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fully support the Commission's Green Paper on the establishment of a European Prosecutor with the remit of defending the Community's financial interests, and I also wholeheartedly support Mrs Theato's report. I also endorse the incorporation of a new Article 280a in the future constitutional treaty, an idea which was in fact rejected by the last intergovernmental conference, despite the support this House gave to the idea in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">It is most definitely necessary to create a European Prosecutor, but we need to assure his or her democratic legitimacy by providing for the European Parliament to give its assent to his or her appointment. We also need stress the need for the European Prosecutor and his or her deputies to have a statute guaranteeing their total independence from parties to any trial and the European Union’s Member States, bodies and institutions. It is also essential to guarantee the uniformity of public prosecution throughout the European legal area by affirming the mandatory prosecution principle, and by imposing strict rules for the conditional dismissal of cases. We also support the principle of a Community court responsible for preparing criminal cases, within the Court of Justice. Lastly, it will of course also be important to guarantee better coordination, indeed the best coordination possible, between the European Prosecutor and the structures of OLAF, Eurojust and Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Theato has just emphasised, we have appealed to the Convention, and hope that it will take our views on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many thanks, Diemut, above all for your readiness to compromise. I am glad that in the end a compromise was found between those who wanted to see a European Public Prosecutor close to the Commission and those who did not want a European Public Prosecutor at all. The Theato report now makes quite clear that such a Public Prosecutor will only exist in connection with Eurojust, only as a position at Eurojust. That makes sense because a European Public Prosecutor working separately would otherwise have to confront the same problems as national public prosecutors in cross-border prosecutions. We will shortly have 25 national legal codes, 25 codes of criminal procedure, 25 legal systems and 21 languages in this enlarged European Union. Such coordination would require an enormous new apparatus. Alternatively, we could avoid duplication by simply relying on Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">That also means, however, that the actual charge must be brought before national courts by national public prosecutors. That therefore means that a European Public Prosecutor merely prepares a case. And it must also be made perfectly clear here that we are limiting the Public Prosecutor’s powers to the protection of the European Union’s financial interests. We must therefore say a clear no to a general European Public Prosecutor for all serious cross-border crime, such as the Presidium of the Convention is currently proposing, because there is nothing to be gained by it. In other areas, trials fail not out of lack of interest on the part of national public prosecutors, as is the case with the financial protection of the European Union, but mostly as a result of language barriers and legal problems. We cannot harmonise everything in this Union, however. We cannot, for example, harmonise criminal law, criminal procedure, the training of public prosecutors or the court system. In these areas we can only coordinate. That is why I would like to send a clear signal to the Convention again here: a Public Prosecutor to protect the financial interests of the European Union – Yes; a general European Public Prosecutor to fight crime – No. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In its opinion, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs said YES to the establishment of a European Prosecutor. It said yes because it feels that the problems which the European Union currently faces need a more systematic approach and solution.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, it underlines certain issues which it considers important. The first issue has to do with the jurisdiction of the European Prosecutor. Of course, we all agree that the starting point was to combat fraud, which something needs to be done about immediately. It is a sad fact, unfortunately, but it is a fact nonetheless. However, the committee pointed out that transnational relations and the collective structures to which Member States take recourse mean that an evolutionary approach must be taken to the jurisdiction of the European Prosecutor, so that, if necessary, powers to combat other crimes can be added at a later date; unfortunately, as we all know, the current international system is always thinking up new crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point made by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerns the role of the European Parliament in relation to the European Prosecutor. We feel that the European Parliament, which was the first to underline the issues and the problems of pan-European crime, should be the institution to which the European Prosecutor is accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor goes hand in hand with the development of European criminal law, which is an inevitable development, and finally, it is, I think, important to point out, within the structure of relations between the European Union and its Member States, how the European Prosecutor will stand in relation to national public prosecutors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen. Mrs Theato, I am sorry I was not able to be here when you made your speech. I had a trialogue here in the House that has only just finished. Fighting European budget fraud is and remains one of the Commission’s most important concerns. We know that we can count on Parliament unreservedly in this, since it has taken and is taking many initiatives in this field. We all know that the only appropriate and effective way of tackling crimes against Community finance is for there to be consistent criminal prosecution. That is why, in 2000, the Commission proposed including a provision for establishing the office of a European Public Prosecutor in the EC Treaty. At the time, the Council decided not to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in December 2001 that the Commission presented the Green Paper on the criminal-law protection of financial interests and the establishment of a European Prosecutor, which is being discussed today and is the subject of the report. On the basis of that Green Paper, the Commission initiated a discussion process in 2002. The European Parliament, and in particular the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, has made an important contribution to that debate and also given it impetus. Mrs Theato, everyone here knows that we really would not have made the progress that we have with the project for a European Prosecutor without your active support and your commitment. I would particularly like to thank you for that on the Commission’s behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Commission presented a follow-up report to the Green Paper, summarising the outcome of the public consultation. Most people who took part in the debate and in the consultation process have a basically positive attitude towards a European Public Prosecutor. As we all know, the governments had more reservations about it than the members of the legal professions and of the non-governmental organisations, and in particular than people who have to deal with the question every day. But only a minority are totally against the project. Over all, however, openness to the project of a European Public Prosecutor has grown appreciably as the year has gone by.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore reaffirms its proposal for the establishment of a Public Prosecutor. This outcome is all the more important now that the Convention – as someone has already said – has entered its crucial phase. Specific proposals for a constitution are now being discussed. Last week the Convention Presidium proposed including an Article 20 about the European Public Prosecutor’s office in the ‘Justice and Internal Affairs’ Title, and the Plenum of the Convention will give its opinion on that next week. In this crucial phase it really is essential that Parliament and the Commission should be pulling in the same direction and sending the Convention a clear message.</p>
<p class="contents">It is already a cause for some satisfaction that our common concern has nevertheless come far enough for the European Public Prosecutor’s office to have been given an article of its own in the draft treaty. The debate has done much to bring this about and it is very much to your credit. However, the Commission takes the view that the Presidium’s proposal does not go far enough. It stops short of the actual objective. What is proposed is a clause empowering the Council to create the office of European Public Prosecutor unanimously at some time in the future. With an empowerment clause of that nature, the European Prosecutor may well turn out to be an empty promise in an enlarged Union of 25 or more Member States. That is the risk. We must therefore anchor the office of the European Prosecutor in the Treaty itself, otherwise it is to be feared that the project really will be postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Parliament and the Commission are in full and complete agreement on this eminently important and highly political question. I hope that a large number of amendments will be tabled for the Convention’s plenary session on 3 and 4 April with the aim of creating a European Public Prosecutor in the Treaty itself. The Commission therefore welcomes the European Parliament’s support, which is expressed very, very clearly in Mrs Theato’s report. I congratulate you warmly on this report, knowing how much personal commitment lies behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Convention’s decision-making phase that now lies before us, it is of the utmost importance that Parliament gives a clear sign. The Commission agrees with the essentials of Mrs Theato’s report on the Green Paper, as I have said. But we do not agree entirely on every point. We are, for example, still debating whether there is a need for a Preliminary Chamber, whether national court control of the Public Prosecutor’s decisions is sufficient or not and whether it can be transferred.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Eurojust is concerned, the Commission also considers it desirable that the European Public Prosecutor’s office should be close to this institution. We have said more about this in our <span class="italic">follow-up</span> report. There are still doubts about whether this can be achieved effectively by means of a strengthened Eurojust taking on the tasks of the Public Prosecutor’s office. This is being discussed. Both functions – the central criminal prosecution of crimes against the Union’s financial interests and the coordination of national criminal prosecution authorities in other areas of crime – could be brought together in a common structure, under the same roof so to speak. Transferring Eurojust to the first pillar is in this respect a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. That also has to be made very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees with the report that some questions connected with the creation of a European Public Prosecutor’s office still need further discussion. This is true of the question of secondary law. In our <span class="italic">follow-up</span> report we said we wanted to look in more detail at the following questions in particular, namely the question of evidence, so that evidence lawfully collected in one Member State can be admitted in another Member State, and the procedural guarantees for the accused, on which a special consultation is taking place on the basis of another Green Paper presented by my colleague Mr Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will comply with the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control and look at these questions in detail in the course of this year. In so doing it will be guided by the proposals made by the Convention and in particular also by the work in the field of justice and internal affairs. The important thing now, however, is that a European criminal prosecution authority should be anchored in the Constitutional Treaty itself with a basis in law for developing the secondary law that will then be necessary. That is the only way of dealing effectively on the criminal law side with the current difficulties in fighting fraud and corruption that are such a drain on the Community budget. If we want to help to make the building of Europe more popular with the citizens and taxpayers, we must send an effective signal with the future Treaty.</p>

<p class="contents">At the heart of this issue lies the concern to protect the financial interests of European taxpayers. For some time the European Parliament has been calling for the creation of a European Prosecutor with competences relating to the Union’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to point out the existing differences between the Member States, which result in a lack of efficiency. We must ensure greater European cooperation and move forward with the creation of a European judicial area.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Prosecutor would be to tackle cross-border fraud by means of the adoption of specific rules making it possible to combat that fraud, including the definition of crimes. The new Constitutional Treaty must make the basis for this European Prosecutor clear, and it should be based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, resolving the problems caused by the fragmentation of the current European judicial system.</p>
<p class="contents">We must achieve a transparent system which preserves the balance between efficiency and the investigation procedure, in the event of cross-border crime, and respect for fundamental rights, with coherence and cooperation between the existing structures: OLAF, Eurojust, Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented certain amendments aimed at taking this clarification further, and I would therefore ask the other groups to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to stress this report’s aim of contributing to the constitutional process under way so that we might clarify this issue of the European Prosecutor, which is enormously important for the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I must congratulate Mrs Theato, who has done an enormous amount of work, which has not been easy, and I hope she will achieve the proposed objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is no accident that the Committee on Budgetary Control repeatedly comes forward with such initiatives since we are finding from experience that it is impossible to protect a budget that has now grown to EUR 100 000 million with the funds of 50 years ago, that is with national funds. This clear statement and such initiatives as today’s Theato report are things we owe to our taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">They know there have been initiatives like OLAF. We know everything is not yet perfect. There are intermediate stages and I believe a Public Prosecutor of this kind will not be the most perfect thing of all time, either. But it will be a very important step towards protecting Europe’s taxpayers. And it is important, above all, that Parliament should make clear that this institution will have a democratic foundation. Europe also has institutions, such as Europol, that are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and it is therefore not surprising that people learn from the media that the Member States apparently allow Europol, behind closed doors, to process quite fantastic amounts of money. Obviously there is no transparency because Parliament is not involved and I believe it is important that we secure these things for the Public Prosecutor. We have already on occasion – and in other reports – pointed out that we want this Article 280(a). Parliament voted on it again two weeks ago in Strasbourg and I hope that here, too, Parliament will back the rapporteur’s third paragraph, which deals with this.</p>
<p class="contents">From time to time, quite specific examples make clear how important a Public Prosecutor is for us. Not long ago, we called on the smallest Member State, Luxembourg, to take action in a case – the so-called Perilux affair – that has been pending at the Luxembourg Public Prosecutor’s office for years. Massive amounts of European taxpayer’s money are involved. Luxembourg is not responding, and we must stress from this place once again how important a European Public Prosecutor would be to perhaps give a bit of a kick to Member States that do not take European taxpayers’ interests quite so seriously. Such cases come up repeatedly and it is particularly annoying in Luxembourg’s case because Belgian courts have already reached findings in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Again warm congratulations and I think this House will take a good and important decision today with this report!</p>

At the same time, it must however be acknowledged that this is basically a national problem in as much as approximately 80% of the EU budget is administered by the national authorities. I think that, in this area, the Member States display a fundamental unwillingness to take the necessary initiatives to deal specifically with fraud involving EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This is borne out by, for example, the Commission’s statement that, out of every four cases that are brought to light by OLAF and that should lead to the national authorities’ being prosecuted, only one has legal consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I find all this unacceptable. It does not however lead me unconditionally to endorse Mrs Theato’s conclusion that the optimum and only solution lies in setting up another institution: a common European Prosecutor in the form of a body taking precedence over national legislation and demanding extensive harmonisation in areas in which the Member States traditionally have different legal traditions and legal concepts. I need only mention harmonisation of penal legislation, production of evidence, penalties and the rules governing legal processes.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to implement this model here and now, I would anticipate major conflicts of authority between the common European Prosecutor and the national authorities, as well as some overlap in relation to other Community initiatives such as Eurojust, OLAF and Europol, initiatives that, in view of the short period of time they have been up and running, should at all events be given more time to produce results in areas including that of fraud involving EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">That having been said, however, I do in actual fact support in principle the idea of setting up this authority and embedding it in the treaty. I just do not think that the time is ripe for such a drastic harmonisation of fundamental areas of legal policy, as proposed by Mrs Theato.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe instead that a European Prosecutor’s office should be developed gradually and within the framework of strengthened Eurojust cooperation. That is, moreover, the model mentioned by Mrs Theato in Article 22, Paragraph 2 of her report.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, it is these considerations that form the basis of the amendments to the report tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my group I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, for the courage and persistence with which she has fought for this matter for years, and I also expressly include Commissioner Schreyer in my thanks for supporting the fight for a European Public Prosecutor’s Office in the Green Paper and countless hearings.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we still do not really have a Community policy for European home affairs and justice. The third pillar not only excludes Parliament from important areas of parliamentary codetermination and control, but is also the cause of many democratic deficits in European legal and justice policy. The establishment of OLAF as a European fraud office without judicial accompaniment creates a legal vacuum at European level. Once again, we have taken the second step before the first.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Convention does not really seem to be seeing how acute the problem is either. What other explanation can there be for the fact that the Convention Presidium is again insisting on unanimity in the Council for a decision on establishing a European Public Prosecutor? The Council has shown in the past that it is not single minded in this and it has unfortunately also repeatedly shown that it is not always single minded in really working to prevent fraud and to protect the EU’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore show great unity and a broad majority in Parliament today. I believe we urgently need such a broad majority in order to demonstrate to the Convention Plenum in particular that we are against such unanimity and that we believe that the European Public Prosecutor’s Office must have a really important place in the new treaty, that the establishment of this Public Prosecutor’s Office must be decided by qualified majority and that here, too, Parliament must be given rights of codetermination.</p>

<p class="contents">One of the most important factors when we look at the creation of new offices or new institutions under the European Treaties is that there are a number of elements that have to be remembered first and foremost. These are basic issues. Is there a public demand for this? No. Will it be more efficient? No. Will it deliver a better form of justice? No. Will it more effectively secure the financial interests of the European Community or the European institutions? No. The reason is that in each Member State we already have in place a number of public prosecutors with special competence in their own areas to deal with fraud and criminal prosecutions and to understand the rules and requirements of evidence in each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that throughout all of those public prosecutors' offices there is the necessary understanding of what the European Union's financial interests are. There must be greater cooperation between OLAF, the Court of Auditors and those national prosecutors in the bringing of prosecutions in the national courts and there must also, in addition to the Eurojust system, be a greater opportunity for the sharing of interests, for the sharing of education and for the sharing of understanding between the judicial members in each Member State so that a commonality eventually arrives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am somewhat disappointed by one of the comments in the report stating that common rules of evidence must be established. In the British legal system, which is the common law system, the rules of evidence were established over 322 years – and yet we are going to bring in common rules of evidence willy nilly? It is important that we remember that the people in the European Union are entitled to have proper representation in relation to their concerns. They are entitled to have their taxes protected but the best way to protect the taxpayers and the taxpayers' interests is at the national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is also the joke about the tourist who, lost in depths of Ireland, asked a local how to get to Tipperary and he was told ‘I would not start from here’. Yet, lost at the bottom of the hole, starts Mrs Theato, who declares in her explanatory statement that ‘it has long been acknowledged that the Communities' financial interests require special protection under criminal law’. I agree, but if there were no Community funds, there would be no Community financial interests and, therefore, no need for their protection. That is where I am coming from. It has never made sense to hand over money to an organisation to spend in a manner that has evaded reform and which cannot be accounted for. That is the 'hole'. The answer is to stop digging. Stop giving the Community money.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the creation of a European Prosecutor: that might be your desired destination, but my advice is that if I were you, I would not start from here.

It is noticeable, for example, that the Netherlands reports four times as many fraud cases as, for example, Spain or Greece.

As a member of the European Convention, I think our job is to look for ways in which we do not add to institutional bureaucracy, but we try to simplify things so that the citizens of Europe are both protected and more in touch with those who represent them.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot see the advantages of having this particular office even if, as one of my colleagues has just said, it is embedded in another institution. There are difficulties in relation to cost and bureaucracy. There are difficulties, as has been suggested, in relation to the fitting of this particular role into the legal systems of Europe, which are very different in their effect, in the evidence they collect and the nature of the prosecution process itself. In my view, there is also a difficulty on the legal base. In addition, if we are to allow the organisations presently in place to reform, this would not be helpful to them in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is more cooperation between States and the Commission – between authorities. We need to clarify internal accounting arrangements and to give greater penalties to States which take inadequate approaches to fraud. We need to encourage greater action by States and improve the role of the Court of Auditors. We need more internal reforms. The reform strategy of the EU has, in my view, stalled at the present time – it needs to be revived. Frankly, there is no point in treating Member States of the EU as naughty children, taking their toys away from them and giving them to some over-worked and inadequate new minder.</p>
<p class="contents">If we respect our membership to the EU, we ought also to respect our ability to prosecute effectively and to deal with fraud and reform as necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Diemut Theato, has been tireless in calling for a European Public Prosecutor to be established in order to address this situation. Commissioner Schreyer has also given her unrelenting support to this initiative, and I therefore wish to congratulate both of them on their hard work and dedication. Nevertheless, and with all the friendship, consideration and respect that I have for them, I must highlight two aspects of this matter that I believe are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that European citizens would not understand our institutions resolving once again to consider only economic issues, ignoring the concept of citizenship. I do not think it is acceptable to establish a European Prosecutor who looks after our financial interests but who ignores, for example, crimes involving the trafficking of human beings, particularly of children.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the number of European bodies working in the field of preventing, fighting and prosecuting crime, Europol, Eurojust and OLAF, and the complexity of defining the scope of each of these counsel caution in this field. The worst situation we could face would be to increase the entropy of the system, with the various bodies being concerned only with their own competences, without the fight against economic crime on a European scale being pursued more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say a final word to express my reservations about the principles of the secrecy of justice and of the independence of the prosecutor’s office when adopted as absolute principles, as has happened, in the latter case, with the Commission Green Paper. One only has to bear in mind the disappointing results achieved in my country in this field to understand the need not to make the same mistakes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I call on those who truly believe in European integration to be consistent and to support the plan for a stronger European Union, that is, which can avail itself of all the necessary means in order to exert real influence on the scourge of fraud prejudicial to the Union’s financial interests, since until now, these interests have not been adequately protected by the Member States with their laws. It is a fact that each year the amount of fraud prejudicial to Community budgets – that is, in the final analysis, prejudicial to European taxpayers – amounts to approximately EUR one billion, as rightly stated by the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Theato – who has all my admiration and respect – and all the studies agree in saying that this phenomenon is set to steadily increase.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the existing legal instruments to combat fraud such as the conventions and protocols ratified by the Member States, the cumbersome nature of actually putting into practice mutual assistance in criminal matters, the nature of OLAF which, under its mandate, has to restrict itself to mere administrative checks and, above all, the fragmentation of the European criminal law-enforcement area are totally insufficient to effectively fight this phenomenon, and the excuses which have been proffered until now do not convince me that we should abandon the European Public Prosecutor either.</p>
<p class="contents">The mere decision in principle is, however, not sufficient: if we really are in favour of establishing a European Public Prosecutor, we must be consistent in also providing him with the effective means to operate. We must therefore define with the greatest precision, at Community level, the crimes and penalties stipulated for criminal acts and moreover, draw up common provisions in the field of European Union criminal law and criminal procedural law. Consequently, I also believe, as the rapporteur Mrs Theato says, that in observing the separation of powers, the European Public Prosecutor and the deputy European prosecutors must be independent and carry out their mandate on the basis of the principle of mandatory prosecution. Furthermore, it will be necessary to subject the European Public Prosecutor’s actions to judicial review, both with regard to investigations and to committals for trial.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, honest citizens of the Union can only welcome the creation of an instrument which fights dishonest people at all times and in all areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A great deal of time and energy has been invested; unfortunately, chiefly in using this deficiency to set up a European judiciary. This report is based on political motives, as the previous speaker illustrated. It is no wonder, then, that it arouses political opposition. I regret that this is to the detriment of an objective discussion.</p>

A proposal – for a European Public Prosecutor – which, as luck would have it, has been put forward again by the Praesidium of the Convention: Article 20 proclaims a European law creating a European Public Prosecutor’s office, whose structure should be decided by a majority vote. This gives rise to further concerns, not least because very sensitive issues arise regarding the Prosecutor, such as the principle of the free movement of evidence, insofar as this means that the conditions for the admissibility of evidence specifically laid down in the legal system of the individual state in which judgment is to be passed will be glossed over. Cross-border crime will not be tackled by destroying national legal traditions, but through appropriate controls and with efficient, effective measures to fight, prevent and eliminate international financial crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, too, shows the urgent need to create a European Public Prosecutor to bring to court solely and exclusively cases of fraud involving European money, and to do so soon after the offence was committed, because a preventive effect can only be expected if prosecution and conviction follow quickly. Although in principle I would be the last person to advocate a further transfer of powers to the EU, in this exceptional case it is justified because all – and I stress all – the bodies that have been responsible for the protection of European money up until now have failed lamentably, most of all the present Commission, which is being reduced by this task to throwing around verbal abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for action is greater than ever, however, because the amount of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism is growing. I need only mention the most recent goings on in the European Statistical Office, EUROSTAT. For the most part, national public prosecutors cannot cope. But hanging the small fry and letting the big fish get away is having a devastating effect on European citizens’ confidence in the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to the Council and the Convention: we do not need any more green papers. What we need is a clear legal basis that clearly defines the task to be performed. Then there will be no more room for objections from individual Member States. This first step must be taken now with the revision of the treaties and eastwards enlargement. If we succeed, this institution will be linked inseparably to Mrs Theato’s efforts, and I expressly thank her here once again for her persistent efforts.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, today we have an open market within the European Union, but that means that the market is also open to fraudsters. Most of the fraud against the EU actually comes from money not collected. The Commission has estimated that EUR 90 billion has been lost to the EU budget from cigarette smuggling alone. We have some measures in place to stop fraud from occurring. OLAF has been established, it does its job and passes on the file to the Member States – where it sits on a shelf. We could sanction the Court of Auditors, but the question still has to be answered: who prosecutes? We could fraud-proof further but the question remains: who prosecutes? The establishment of Eurojust is there, but again: who prosecutes? The answer, which is factual rather than theoretical, is: almost nobody.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are not serious about tackling fraud in the EU. It took five years for them to ratify the Convention on the protection of financial interests. Prosecution against people who rip off the EU is absolutely minimal. The current system does not work. It is extremely difficult to prosecute cross-border fraud, partly because evidence collected in one Member State does not count in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here on the table is a Green Paper. It is essential that the European Public Prosecutor's powers are restricted to the financial interests of the EU budget. Anything beyond that opens the door to massive complications and serious constitutional implications – which is why Paragraph 4, which calls for a judicial area to be set up, is nonsense. If the problem exists now, just imagine how difficult it will become following enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are serious about tackling fraud, we must accept that the current system does not work and until there is an acceptable alternative, we must go along with this.</p>

There is currently no legal institution competent to carry out enquiries within the Community bodies, due to the latters’ privileged status. If any task can be justified for a European Prosecutor, it is this, first and foremost. Apart from that, with regard to the possible future creation of a supranational body responsible for conducting inquiries and taking public action against the Member States in the event of violations damaging the financial interests of the Community, we feel that the proposed operation has more disadvantages than advantages. Naturally, variations in national legal areas can, in some cases, hinder the prosecution process. The purpose of Eurojust, however, is to remedy this problem while respecting national competence. We must first allow it to act and develop before judging its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The supranational European Prosecutor proposed by the Commission, meanwhile, would lead us into an administrative black hole, since not only would we have to harmonise charges, penalties, restrictions and all kinds of procedures, such as acceptability of evidence, but we would also have to consider the issue of protecting individual freedom for all coercive acts required by the European Prosecutor: searches, seizures, telephone tapping, arrest warrants, judicial reviews and pre-trial detention, not to mention, of course, the vast issue of the democratic control that would need to be established. This is a huge issue, Mr President, and I strongly encourage my fellow Members to choose Eurojust instead, as this could achieve the same results without the problems of destabilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe she has crystallised a lot of the hard work that has gone into this subject. She has proposed what I think to be a convincing case to the European Convention for inclusion of this provision in an amended treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussing this matter, we should not create the feeling – which some people have done and have been trying to do – that, in some way or another, the European Union's treasury is a more leaky vessel than those of the Member States or similar treasuries throughout the world. We are no better or no worse, but we do compare with the higher standards of accountancy and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, most of the arguments that are put forward against this idea are political, ideological arguments. The arguments sought to stir up the people who are concerned about a transfer of power and competences from national parliaments to Europe and the creation of more unnecessary bureaucracy. I do not see it this way at all. We have transferred to this Union 1% of our national taxation, which is used in the interest of Community policies. We have provided the financial control to deal with that. We have provided OLAF to further investigate suspected problems. But we do not take the final step, which is to create the means to prosecute people who we have found guilty of violating our laws. I have experienced this in my everyday life; I have seen cases in which companies and individuals have been found guilty of abusing Community funds. I have seen situations where a large number of people from a particular sector, which is well financed by the Union, seem to be able continuously to get away with violations of our rules and regulations on the spending of money. In one case, I see the public taxpayer in a Member State being forced to pay through the clearance of accounts for the crimes of individual companies. In other situations, I see the failure to pay levies whereby the national government, again, picks up the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">If we had a European Prosecutor dealing with our own resources – we do not want to take it any further than that – I think the focus of the authorities in the Member States who actually spend this money would be sharpened. I also think that OLAF would be less frustrated when, after having proceeded and found situations serious enough to be passed on to Public Prosecutors at national level, it does not happen. If we had a European Prosecutor, we could satisfy our taxpayers that we were taking matters to the proper conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improving effectiveness and transparency in the use of human resources is therefore welcome, noteworthy and justifiable. The quality of European citizenship, in other words the feeling of belonging to a supranational area of solidarity, is also reinforced by the way in which the Union’s financial pillar is used.</p>
<p class="contents">As the budgetary authority, the European Parliament is crucial to achieving this improvement. We can therefore only praise the Commission’s efforts intended to improve the criminal-law protection of the Community’s financial interests and particularly to create a European Prosecutor. In order for the reforms we are now examining to lead to effective protection of the European taxpayers’ money and also of the Union’s credibility to ensure this protection, we must make a major effort to harmonise procedures, to coordinate actions and to ensure fair and open cooperation between Member States. It is also crucial, however, that the essence of this policy is made irreversible, depending on how the Community method is used.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the recommendation by the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, when she maintains that criminal law cannot be envisaged as an area for Union regulation only in the third pillar and when she argues that the creation of the European Prosecutor on the basis of the first pillar could be an extremely significant step for the future structure of ‘EU Powers’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Italian Radicals, we will continue to consistently oppose the bare idea of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor which is not accompanied by those instruments and those arrangements which form part of the legal and cultural heritage of our countries. How can we possibly consider just a European Public Prosecutor without the judgment, appeal and defence mechanisms which are inherent and peculiar to each country’s legal system? Rushing headlong in this way can only make the structure that we are trying to give Europe even more justicialist and export a certain model of Italian justice with which we are all familiar and which has caused a great deal of harm in our country. These are the reasons why we will be voting against the Theato report, having already voted against in committee, not because the idea <span class="italic">per se</span> is without foundation, but because it lacks all the attributes to make it effectively fair, as justice also at European level should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to place the report within its context and point out that we are talking about establishing the European Parliament’s position in relation to the Commission’s Green Paper on the European financial prosecutor. By means of this publication, the Commission intends to establish an extremely broad debate on all the issues relating to this figure and this has led it to include certain points which, if this were a legislative draft, would be considered crude, with gaps, and questionable in many respects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper, however, can be summed up in the idea, the intellectual hypothesis, that the defence of Community, and therefore cross-border, financial interests can perhaps be better defended by a figure also at Community level in this same field.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s work is conditional upon this structure and therefore has to respond to the most significant issues in the Green Paper and also glean from that supplementary and premature information the essential notion, which is to achieve the legal basis necessary to continue a careful analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two topical reasons why this treatment and the approval of this report are advisable. On the one hand, the current Convention and the next intergovernmental conference which will establish the future of Community law and, on the other hand, the imminent incorporation of the new members which, on entering, should be faced with a legal basis which would allow them to be involved in the collective work of creating, when appropriate, the figure of European financial prosecutor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gargani (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Theato report on the Commission’s Green Paper on the protection of Community financial interests and on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor has had a lot of preparation and a long debate. At the beginning, we agreed on this, provided that the office of Prosecutor remained, and still remains limited, precisely, to the financial interests of the Community. During the debate and the assessments made by the Parliamentary committees however, the original measure was in danger of being distorted and taking on a different, dangerous form in the European institutional context. This is why the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, early on, prepared a negative opinion but, subsequently, following intelligent steps by Mr Lehne and explanations from the Chairman, Mrs Theato, it set out a compromise opinion and tried to bring the institution which we want to regulate back towards the original suggestion. Further discussions with Mrs Theato enabled us to reach a united, compromise position, which we hope will be endorsed in the Chamber this morning. With great sensitivity, Mrs Theato took this issue on herself because, in actual fact, the European Union’s legal system does not provide for competences in the field of criminal law and criminal procedural law, or a judiciary endowed with all the degrees of adjudication able to guarantee the full right of defence. In the absence of such conditions, the creation of an independent European Public Prosecutor without any controls would damage, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the already fragile interinstitutional balance between the Union and the States in an area as sensitive as justice: it would therefore be illogical and unjustified. In particular, the creation of such a body would seem truly premature if we consider that we have not yet attained the objectives on judicial cooperation, let alone, where necessary, on the harmonisation of the rules on Member States’ criminal-law issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the context of Eurojust – this certainly does have a subsidiarity problem and a major problem with coordinating the European States – and in this context alone that we can truly achieve a significant, uniform result which respects the States and at the same time provides the guarantees which the European Union must have. This is how we are going to vote, and we will table these amendments to the Convention, which obviously cannot incorporate a European Prosecutor, an unrestricted super-prosecutor, which would run counter to all the guarantees which nevertheless exist in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
