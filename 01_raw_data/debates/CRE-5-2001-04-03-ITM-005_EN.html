As this is the first discharge to which the Prodi Commission has been subjected, it has been full of suspense. The 1998 discharge decision was postponed in April 2000 and discharge was subsequently granted in July 2000, but all this leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address just three particular matters of concern. In 1998, for the fifth consecutive time, the Court of Auditors declined to give a positive Statement of Assurance, or in other words to certify that European taxpayers' money had been used carefully and thriftily. Parliament therefore certainly did the right thing when it called on the Commission to arrive at a positive Statement of Assurance for the financial year 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission has failed up to now to take concrete and measurable steps in this direction. It is not enough that the Commission has repeatedly referred to the general reform programme. I would therefore like to ask the Commission if careful use of European taxpayers' money should not be a priority theme for the Commission. Or does the Commission perhaps want to celebrate an anniversary in 2003 – ten years of being refused a positive Statement of Assurance? We judge the Commission not by its words, but by its deeds. That is why I specifically welcome the deadlines that we have set you for achieving this objective. The Fléchard case in particular has made it clear that the role of an independent Financial Controller is vital in determining whether a fraud case is admitted or not. You now want to scrap the independence of the Financial Controller and make him report to the relevant Director-General as part of the reform programme. There can be no doubt that this would lead to a spectacular fall in the error rate, but probably not because no more errors or frauds were being committed, but rather because the authorising Directors-General would ensure that such matters never came to light at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of an independent disciplinary chamber able to carry out a fair and neutral disciplinary procedure, with the officials responsible being appropriately held to account, is also another long-standing request from Parliament that the Commission has failed to comply with. The Commission has equally failed to seriously pursue the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to prosecute cases of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of access by Members of Parliament to information and documents, I would like to seriously ask the Commissioner how we are to carry out our verification duty if you refuse to let us have information and documentation? At the beginning of its period of office, the Commission espoused the cause of transparency and openness. I myself saw during the 1998 discharge procedure how wide the gap is between rhetoric and reality here. Nor was there any substantial improvement for the 1999 discharge procedure. You only have to look at Annexes I and II to the Blak report to see that the rapporteur received 22 of the audit reports he requested and, believe it or not, did not receive 11 reports. I think these figures speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament has dealt a fatal blow as regards this inadequate access to information. As you know, that agreement was approved here in the House in July 2000 without our having an opportunity to debate it. This framework agreement is driving a wedge between Members and is creating a two-tier Parliament. It is encouraging a policy of <span class="italic">divide et impera –</span> divide and rule. We can no more tolerate this than we can tolerate a lack of access to general documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you that last December we agreed, by adopting the Morgan report, that in future we would defer discharge if the Commission had not made available all the documents requested. We have actually found ourselves in that position sooner than many people expected.</p>
<p class="contents">One more comment on the Fléchard case, and let me be clear about this: the Commission cannot in all honesty avoid making a clear admission that the procedure adopted at the time was wrong and that everything must be done to prevent such an unlawful decision ever being made again. Mrs Schreyer, as the Commissioner responsible you have an opportunity to make a statement to that effect. Please take that opportunity here today. I will make no bones about it: my decision whether or not to vote for discharge will depend on what you say today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blak (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> –<span class="italic"> (DA) </span>Mr President, strangely enough, this is the first time in many years that the discharge is likely to be given on time. Therefore, it will be a great moment, for Parliament as well as the Commission, when we put it to the vote tomorrow. Has the Commission lived up to expectations, then? Maybe not quite yet. However, I think a general change of attitude has taken place in the Commission. A shock wave went through the system when the Santer Commission was removed in 1999. The Commission is now aware that the threat is real. Parliament can and will use the discharge to remove the Commission if it does not live up to expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, there are certain MEPs who will refuse to grant discharge. I believe that would be a very big mistake. This is something we must only do in special circumstances when we have really good arguments for doing so. If we do it every year, the threat, of course, loses its value. We must cooperate with all those forces that wish to make European cooperation more efficient and open. I think that this is what most MEPs want. I have therefore collaborated with all the political groups represented in the Committee. Undoubtedly, this has improved the report, as well as the atmosphere in the Committee. The new Commission has initiated large-scale reform. Mr Kinnock has promised us the best administration in the world. We shall now see whether the fine words can be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I have prepared a very critical, yet constructive report. It also recognises the fact that the Commission is in the process of implementing large-scale reforms and, at the same time, addresses the sore points. In 1999, things were simply a mess. There was no overview of the internal and external audit reports, and the archive was also in something of a mess. We must hope that the reforms will remedy this. I have drawn up a 10-point plan which is largely based on the spirit of the reforms but which goes further in some areas. I look forward to hearing the Commission’s response to my proposals. We have received a lot of information this year. We might have wished for more extensive and more timely information, but many of the delays can be attributed to the framework agreement. In my experience, this is a poor framework agreement. It is used to withhold documents and to keep documents confidential for, in the end, it is the Commission which decides whether a document should be deemed confidential. I have respected the framework agreement because it is currently in force. However, I think it should be revised. In my opinion, we should work towards a re-negotiation of the framework agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the greatest dangers of this agreement is that ordinary committee members are reduced to second-rate members. Considerable information is provided to the rapporteur and the committee chairman only, and so the taxpayers are not given the optimum guarantee that nothing is kept secret or swept under the carpet. It will never be discovered. However, Parliament should certainly also ‘look nearer home’. Why have we not yet arranged for a secure archive to be set up to which Members may come to read confidential documents under proper conditions? We must therefore ensure that the Commission can trust us. I am delighted that the Commission has put its trust in me as rapporteur. We have been provided with more information than ever before in the history of the discharge, and I should like to commend the Commission for that. We could sense quite clearly that the Commission wanted a timely discharge . Some of us can surely confirm this.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the Commission has taken the discharge very seriously this year. It is the first time that so many Commissioners have been present in the Committee. The Committee saw all 12 Commissioners. This indicates that the new Commission is interested in, and respects, the discharge procedure. However, I do not fully agree with the Commission’s view of what Parliament’s discharge should be based on. Basically, the Commission believes that the discharge should be based on the various reports from the Court of Auditors. That is something I do not agree with. Parliament should not be a detective agency. We should concentrate on structural problems. However, we should have the same access to information as the Court of Auditors. It is the Commission to which Parliament must grant discharge, and that is why we must hold the Commission primarily responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a complex interplay between the Commission and the Council, Parliament, the Court of Auditors, OLAF and the Member States. I therefore made a great effort to incorporate all the institutions in my report. Both the Council and Parliament set limits upon the Commission’s work. Agricultural policy is a good example. The Commission has fought hard to reform agricultural policy. Time and again, it has tabled proposals for countering malpractice, fraud and over- charging and, time and again, Parliament and the Council have voted against these. Unfortunately, there are many such examples, for example in the flax, milk and butter sectors. Every year, the Council has given the Commission the green light in its discharge, so I became curious. What do they really discuss behind the closed doors of the Council? I sent a letter to the Swedish presidency requesting permission to attend the Ecofin meeting where the discharge is adopted. I was very disappointed in the Swedes, who normally boast about their openness. They rejected my request. But then I was very impressed to receive the rejection in all 11 Community languages. I have other things to say, but I shall return to these at the end of the debate.</p>

I hope that this will be the procedure from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have endeavoured, with everybody’s help, to draft a constructive report based on two lines of approach: the quantitative and the qualitative. On the quantitative side, we used the classic method of auditing the implementation of the budget and found things to our satisfaction and liking. We identified a downward trend or, in fact, a constant reduction in the costs of missions between Luxembourg and Brussels. We found that checks made to ascertain whether officials really have taken up residence where they are supposed to have taken up residence have, without any doubt, been stepped up. We found that the number of contracts awarded through open competition is gradually increasing and we hope that this positive development will be put to more frequent use in the future. The inventory of Parliament’s property has been started, albeit somewhat late, and is making headway. Of course, it is disappointing, as we have pointed out, that a price has still not been put on this building, which we have been using for about eighteen months now. We still do not know what it is worth, what it cost or where we stand and everyone involved would do well to bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">On the qualitative side, we found that the European Parliament administers a huge budget. But what do we give out, what image does Parliament project to the outside world as it operates this huge, serious institution? You know, it is tiresome to read nothing but critical comments and critical articles in the press, given the tremendous, fundamental job done in this House, which is precisely why what we have tried to do in this report is to help increase the transparency, acknowledgement and the understanding of what happens and what we do in this chamber of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is to be able to quantify the European Parliament’s contribution to the legislative work of the European communities. We want to start making use of the opinions expressed by the groups of visitors who come and visit Parliament. It would be a good idea if we knew what these citizens, for whom a large sum of money is earmarked so that they can visit and get to know Parliament, feel about the European Parliament, and use them to show us a better way forward. We want to improve the efficiency of the information offices in the various capitals of the fifteen Member States, so that is the direction we are moving in. And we also want continuous support between the services of the European Parliament and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, so that we can implement what we decide and vote on.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the proposal and the decision to create a standing committee consisting of the rapporteur for discharge and the person responsible for Parliament, together with parliamentary officials, to monitor progress in and the implementation of the measures which will be proposed and which we shall vote on here tomorrow. This would turn discharge from a one-off issue into a continuous, constructive procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we want the staff, the officials working on economic affairs here at the European Parliament, to receive continual training, additional training and reintegration into new technologies, so that we can achieve the best possible results. Before closing, may I thank all my fellow members and all those who helped draft this report, because I think that we have done a fine job and I hope that it will be used as an example at all levels.</p>

Nothing could be further from the truth, as is once again borne out in the annual discharge debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The dismissal of the Santer Commission was the turning point in the Union’s financial management. Whilst the Council granted discharge to the same Santer Commission unthinkingly, this Parliament did take its responsibilities seriously. Not only has this increased the political weight of discharge, at the same time, a U-turn has taken place from a bookkeeper’s mentality to one which is focused on content and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The representative body of the people should not only ensure that all receipts are in, but should also check whether the tax money has been spent wisely and whether a result has been achieved. In this respect, assistance from the European Court of Auditors is at hand. However, the Committee on Budgetary Control believes that the monitoring procedure could be far more effective still. For that to happen, the Court of Auditors would need to embark on a consistent naming and shaming, in other words the public pillorying of those Member States who fail to get their act together.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we would like to see the percentage of errors at national and sectoral level clearly quantified in order to gain a better insight into the problems which spending entails. Should this not be possible this year, then the Court of Auditors should in any case draw a distinction between major and minor errors when introducing a so-called Richter scale of errors. Furthermore, the Court of Auditors must realise that it is not above the law itself. It should stop resisting a true audit on itself and must publicise its financial interests on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we have to establish time and again that Europeans, whether they hail from north or south, east or west, have little faith in the European Union’s bookkeeping. It is the costly duty of each and everyone who is involved in the financial monitoring of the European expenditure to win back the confidence of the European citizens. This confidence is a pre-condition for the further political success of European integration, and that confidence can only be regained by maximum transparency. The Europeans want certainty that their money is being spent in the best possible way, and where that is not the case, that the organisations and Member States involved are actually called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another institution – quite a major one at that – which believes that it stands above the supervisory power of the EP: the Council of Ministers, which was once again of the opinion that its presence was not required today. Via a so-called gentlemen’s agreement, Parliament and the Council have agreed not to monitor each other’s spending. This was done in the spirit of ‘If you do not check me out, then I will not cast a critical eye at you either’. Needless to say, this hardly contributes to restoring public confidence. As long as this approach involved purely administrative expenditure, this was perhaps justifiable to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we now see that the Council is assuming further operational responsibilities. Not only does this undermine the position of the Commission, it is also subject to little democratic control. This is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has reached the conclusion that the agreement is due for an overhaul. The Court of Auditors must report on the Council’s spending in the same way as it does for other institutions. The surreptitious manner in which the Council is drawing power towards itself without accounting for it contravenes all basic principles of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary legislation, and powers concerning budgetary control, have always been strong weapons for this Parliament when it came to plugging the different democratic holes. We owe it to our electorate, where possible, to exercise democratic control. Especially in the case of the Council, where the democratic hole is the biggest and is only threatening to get bigger, this form of control is crucial. Also as a message from this Parliament to other institutions, this is, therefore, an important choice to make.</p>
<p class="contents">I can be brief about the committees and agencies. Europe is still under construction and is, as all dynamic processes, subject to change. It is thus no longer logical to scrutinise structures from time to time in the light of all the changes. All European institutions must continue to demonstrate their added value. They must ensure that the money of the European taxpayer is spent wisely. How do they impact on legislation? Do they operate efficiently? It is, naturally, regrettable that the discharge of the Economic and Social Committee has been postponed for the fourth consecutive time due to deception involving non-existing airline tickets. We should really close this chapter once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains for me is to congratulate the many honourable Members who have been involved in the discharge, on their reports. The Committee on Budgetary Control has mainly adopted a restrained and intelligent stance by granting discharge to the Commission, but under strict conditions. We are stepping up the pressure to bring about reforms within this Parliament too. Only if we subject our own actions to the same strict requirements which we impose on other institutions, will we remain a credible reform mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In accordance with decisions taken earlier, it will cease in July 2002. Preparations have been made for its expiry, and in the last few years, the ECSC has not collected tax payments from companies in the coal and steel industry to finance its operations. </p>
<p class="contents">Over the last decade, the way the ECSC has acted is reminiscent of banking. It received credits, which it distributed in the form of loans to develop the coal and steel sector. Borrowers received a sort of interest subsidy with these loans, and its importance to the development of the sector must not be overrated. The importance of the interest benefit has not been examined closely, but it is probably so little that it is fully justifiable to end the work of the ECSC. In 1999 new credits were no longer granted and the ECSC was mainly involved in the claw-back of credits, the repayment of credits it received itself, and the management of surplus funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been responsible for the ECSC. In recent years preparations have been under way to wind it down in July 2002. Then the ECSC will still have amounts outstanding on credits it granted, but the money it borrowed itself should have been paid off. After the repayment of credits it is estimated that the ECSC will still have more than a billion euros in surplus funds, to be transferred from its own balance sheet to the joint EU balance sheet. In accordance with decisions taken earlier on, these will form a research fund, managed by the Commission. The fund will provide support for activities related to the main ECSC areas of industry. There is probably no lack of subjects for research.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the committee, some sort of research should be carried out on how subsidies to the coal industry in some Member States have an impact on the competition situation between different forms of energy. The most striking observation made by the Committee on Budgetary Control on the accounts for 1999 is that it was impossible to assess how efficient the Commission had been in managing ECSC funds. In any evaluation of how efficiently the ECSC has been managed, in its capacity as something akin to a bank, it is necessary to know the actual yield on cash investments and what the share of administrative costs was in attaining this figure. The information is not now available. The committee did receive from the Commission, however, an undertaking to produce this information for the year 2000, after which it will be possible to compare the market return the Commission received on investments with possible earnings received via other channels.</p>
<p class="contents">For decades, loans have also been granted to EU personnel out of ECSC funds. When the ECSC Treaty expires these loans will be incorporated in the EU balance sheet and be managed by the Commission. After that EU staff will be in debt to the EU. It is not appropriate that the EU should act as a mortgage bank for its staff. The committee believes these loans should be transferred to banks. The committee offers this for the Commission to consider in connection with the granting of discharge. The matter will be returned to in connection with the granting of discharge in the years to come. The EU cannot be a mortgage lender for its personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the granting of discharge the work of the Commission will thus be assessed also from the point of view of administrative rationalisation. The minor irregularities discovered in the ECSC accounts from past years were corrected after 1999, and the committee has no special remarks to make with regard to granting discharge in the normal manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too regard it as an enormous problem that the Council is not present for this debate. When you look at the Council's report on the discharge, you really get the impression that in many areas the Council does not know what it is talking about. For instance, when it comes to the Development Funds, you get the impression that the Council has simply dusted off the same opinions it delivered years ago, instead of really coming to grips with the subject. I think this is particularly scandalous given that the Council is partly responsible for the fact that there are problems in this area in the first place. There are still unresolved conflicts of responsibility between the Member States and the Commission here. So I expect the Council to display a rather greater sense of responsibility and to accept more responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is making an effort in the case of this discharge to strike a very careful balance between the urgently required verification work needed, on the one hand, and on the other hand, and this is just as important, the issue of a further loss of confidence in the European institutions. So as rapporteur for the Development Funds I have given considerable thought to whether I can really call for postponement of the discharge. But this is a clear decision, and I have the full support of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to emphasise once again that we are not refusing to grant discharge, as it said in one newspaper today, but rather that we are postponing the discharge. The reason we wish to postpone the discharge in this way is that we believe the Commission is most definitely heading in the right direction, but that it still needs some pressure if it is to go all the way. So this is not a question of a lack of confidence in the relevant Commissioner, but rather an attempt to make it clear that the action plan he produced in conjunction with Parliament during the 1998 discharge one year ago is precisely the right answer to the problems before us, so that we as the Committee responsible and as Parliament wish to incorporate the first results from this action plan in our discharge procedure. As the first results are due in April or May, we wish to postpone the discharge until then.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why we believe that this is undoubtedly necessary is that many improvements still have to be made regarding the Development Funds, or rather the management of the Development Funds, in terms of auditing and cooperation with the Member States. In this context I would like to express my thanks once again for the excellent cooperation we have had with the European Court of Auditors, which was very helpful in its assessment of the management of the Development Funds. I wish to point out that the positive DAS contained in the Court of Auditors' report has to be seen in relative terms, because the Court of Auditors has responded to oral and written questions by commenting that it naturally has some problems here, and that it cannot audit 77 countries and 205 projects itself, so that it is dependent in this area on cooperation with the countries in receipt of aid, and that a great deal of work still remains to be done in this field. On the one hand, the local delegations have to be strengthened, and on the other administrative structures in these countries also have to be reinforced, and there must be joint projects through which those in positions of responsibility in those countries can obtain the information they need from the EU, that is from the Court of Auditors, and also exchange projects with the Court of Auditors for administrators in positions of authority in the ACP countries. We urgently need to improve administrative structures so as to deal properly with the work required in the area of development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must stress that I am also calling for postponement of the discharge because there has been a singular lack of transparency in my field. The Commissioner responsible for my area seemed to be far too tentative and anxious, and in my capacity as rapporteur I received information late, after the deadline or not at all. I also think that his staff's reference to the framework agreement with Parliament is not very helpful as a means of creating confidence on the part of the rapporteur and as a means of ensuring that we work together constructively on this. The Commission must in future act in a more transparent and impressive way, and display greater confidence in its dealings with Parliament, so that we can jointly bring the discharge procedure to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress once again that many things need to be improved in relation to the Development Funds. The Commissioner has some difficult tasks before him. There is a backlog of commitments that he has inherited from the old Commission. The administrative structures are inappropriate and understaffed. In the recipient countries themselves there are problems with wars and other crises, and we have taken all this into account. We are certainly willing to admit that in this area control needs to be handled more carefully. The control process in a developing country must take as its starting point the notion that there is always corruption with development aid and consideration needs to be given to what sort of action to take in a given country.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that we are certainly willing to meet the Commission half way<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>and recognise the major problems that exist. But we would also like to stress again that if the EU and the Commission want to win the confidence of the public in the important field of development aid, they will, of course, also have to make appropriate adjustments to their management structure to reflect the regulations. And it has to be said that the backlog of payment appropriations has certainly reached a worrying level now.</p>
