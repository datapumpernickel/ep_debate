The clearest example of this can be seen at the moment in the American Bush Administration, which regards the expansion of oil extraction as far more important than complying with the climate treaty of Kyoto. After the expenditure of substantial community funds in the EU on unintended environmental destruction, the necessity of environmental protection is now considered more and more obvious. Hopefully that will lead to clearer-headed choices than other EU decisions on the basis of which smoking is discouraged at the same time as tobacco growing is subsidised. In candidate countries we see a similar contradiction. They want money for the building of motorways through areas of natural beauty, for dams that devastate shorelines and watercourses and for large-scale restructuring of the countryside. Anyone frightened to make a choice between the all-powerful economy and the protection of our environment becomes bogged down in conflicting decisions. That is why it is a good thing that the compromise in this third reading forces Member States to inform public opinion and hence also interested organisations and to give them the chance to express their views on projects. Financing from European funds can no longer be a justification for allowing environmentally damaging expenditure to proceed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We acknowledge that, with the amendments that have been made, it makes a clear compromise in favour of constituting a convention for the envisaged reform of the Treaties and that the report accepts the launch of a constitutional process. We must also say, however, that the report is not as critical of the results of the Nice Intergovernmental Conference as it should be. With this report, Parliament is regrettably distancing itself from the prevailing feeling of failure in a European society which saw the Heads of State or Government unable to agree on the path to take for building a political Europe, which is now more necessary than ever because of enlargement towards the States of the East and of the Mediterranean. Once again, the Members of the majority in this Parliament have ignored their responsibility as representatives of the European citizens, have subordinated their positions to those of their governments and, paradoxically, have let themselves be bested by the political representatives of their own States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, now, having heard President Johannes Rau, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Prime­Minister Lionel Jospin, I am convinced and have the regrettable feeling that, if the majority Members had known beforehand the positions of these national leaders, the report that has just been adopted would have been quite different. What I am talking about in particular and what I am most ashamed of is its consideration of the European Parliament as the central location and institution of the political European Union. I hope that in the future constitutional process, this Parliament will maintain a self-respecting position, which is more responsible, especially with regard to the interests and aspirations of our citizens. Lastly, I hope that we learn this lesson and that we are aware of the role that falls to us in European politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At home they say one thing and out here they do something very different. I also find it quite alarming that this treaty basically endorses the whole concept of a European constitution which is something that has not been debated in the national parliaments. In fact, in Ireland when we bring this issue up during the referendum process, we are told that it is not going to happen. It is quite clear today that this is going happen and there needs to be a bit more honesty with the people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is rather disturbing that we had the Swedish Prime Minister, coming here yesterday urging a "yes" vote. People are trying to put pressure on Ireland to say that if do not vote "yes" we will be stopping enlargement when this is not the case. The kind of Europe the Nice Treaty proposes is far more detrimental to the eastern European countries, because it divides Europe. We should be looking for a Europe that is not divided into first and the second-class tiers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Member States are political structures that originated from the greatest capacity for production and mobility, born out of the discovery of the steam engine, which, according to the North American thinker Alvin Tofler, was the second great technological revolution for humanity. This meant that the political framework of the old kingdoms, counties, dukedoms and domains which, until then, had structured societies were small and useless. But since Marshall McLuhan talked about the world as a global village and Tofler himself pointed out information technologies as the third human revolution, the globalisation of political relations with regard to trade, the economy, defence, leisure, and so many other things has meant that the Member States are now also small and inadequate and cannot respond to the current needs of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the future path for the European Union cannot be resolved through the measures adopted in Nice: what is needed is fewer powers for the Member States and more for the European institutions. We need a Constitution, a Parliament, a European Government and a President elected by the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- the loosening up of procedures, making it possible to engage in enhanced cooperation;</p>
<p class="contents">- the increasing of the powers of the President of the Commission and his appointment by a qualified majority of the Council which, together with the recent proposals by the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, on the election of the latter, make it possible to reinforce considerably its legitimacy and therefore its authority.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution should encourage the Heads of State and Government to go even further, particularly by coming out in favour of the convocation of a convention like the one responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, whose participation in the next revision of the Treaties is essential.

In the debate on the Treaty of Nice, almost the only thing discussed was the ‘post-Nice’ situation. All the federalist speakers raised their heads above the parapet, one after the other, to urge the setting up, at the next Council in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency (a presidency which, of course, is in favour of ultra-federalism), of a ‘convention’ which would open up a ‘constitutive process’ which was to produce a ‘European federal constitution’ which the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference would be called upon to adopt. Thus the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is regarded as a fait accompli<span class="italic">.</span> We are not even discussing it. The debate on 2004 has taken the place of the debate on Nice, and no doubt the debate on 2010 will only serve to cover up any debate on the future draft submitted for ratification in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The result, in the short term, is that practically nobody has talked about Nice, and public opinion is still just as ignorant, except in Ireland, where they are holding a referendum, about the content of a very important treaty which will be stealthily submitted for ratification by their national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">We published our alternative report on the Treaty of Nice to try to make sure that the debate in France avoids this legerdemain. In particular it must be emphasised absolutely that the Treaty of Nice as a whole is fundamentally opposed to the spirit and the letter of the French constitution, a spirit which is the spirit of national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Some provisions even contradict it openly. For example, there is the introduction of integration as an objective for the Union and the Community (Article 43 of the EU Treaty), the introduction of uniform regulations and conditions governing Members of the European Parliament (Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty), the creation of regulations governing political parties at European level (Article 191 of the EC Treaty), the appointing of the Commission by a qualified majority (Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty), the approval by a qualified majority of certain international agreements on common foreign and security policy (Article 24 of the EU Treaty), the new measures taken, by majority vote, to introduce the euro (Articles 111 and 123(4) of the EC Treaty), the transfer to Community level of international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property (Article 133 of the EC Treaty), the inclusion of the Community in responsibility for modernising social security (Article 137 of the EC Treaty), or the creation, in vague terms, of a rapid-response military force (Article 17 of the EU Treaty).</p>
<p class="contents">It is absurd, in these circumstances, that at present the French government is not even considering bringing the matter to the attention of the Constitutional Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite its shortcomings, the Treaty of Nice deserves clear support, since it makes the EU ready for enlargement. This quality should not be underestimated. Up until the Intergovernmental Conference, we supported a so-called narrow agenda and also voted against the European Parliament’s very wide-ranging wishes. This will also be reflected in our voting on certain elements of this report, where we have voted against, e.g. the section on enhanced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference that ended in Nice showed that there are great deficiencies in the way in which the EU at present amends treaties. Like the rest of Parliament, we take a positive view of declaration 23 concerning the future of the European Union. However, we oppose large, centrally controlled information campaigns. Nonetheless, we are very concerned that there should be a general debate on the future of the Union in all the countries and in the EU, so that the next Intergovernmental Conference can be much better prepared than that which ended in Nice, with much greater openness in the decision-making process and an underlying basis of visionary ideas concerning the future of the EU. The implementation of a convention in the style of that which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year may be a positive contribution in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Heads of State and Government have in any case admitted this, in the Declaration on the future of the Union, which forms part of the annex to the Treaty. This finding has led the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to demand that the convocation of the new IGC (responsible for carrying out the next revision of the Treaties) should be based on a fundamentally different process, a process which is open and transparent. It proposes to take its inspiration from the effective and universally applauded method which enabled the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to be created.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, therefore, be a matter of bringing together a convention that would be composed of Members of the European Parliament, members of national parliaments, members of the Commission and members of the governments of Member States. It would start meeting at the beginning of 2002, and would have the task of submitting to the IGC (to be held during the second half of 2003), a ‘constitutional proposal’ based on the results of a wide-ranging public debate. This constitutional process would have to result in the adoption of an EU Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the report launches an appeal to national parliaments, urging them to undertake to support the idea of the convocation of such a convention when they are called upon to take a decision on the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Treaty of Nice has given much cause for dissatisfaction, it has, nonetheless, removed the last formal obstacle to enlargement. Having said that, the accession of new Member States requires an in-depth revision of the way our institutions function, because those institutions have almost been brought to a standstill already, when we have only fifteen Member States. The debate is underway. Several political personalities have had an opportunity to make their contribution, but we must involve the greatest possible range of actors, together with all the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by emphasising the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be integrated into the Treaty so as to make it obligatory. This would give a strong political signal to our fellow-citizens. In effect, we now have three years to create, finally, the institutions that will guarantee ‘democracy’, transparency and citizenship at the service of a strong European social plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy, as the report in practice advocates. Instead of transforming the EU into a state, we are of the opinion that the Union must be democratised. Democratisation of the European Union must be achieved through a decreasing of the Commission's power and the introduction of openness and transparency into the legislative practices of the Council. The future debate about the European Union must also be about the role of the national parliaments in the future Europe. Today, political debate in Europe is focused on elections to the national parliaments (with the exception of the presidential elections in some states) and this can also be seen in the turnout in the different elections. The role of the national parliaments must be strengthened in decision-making in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We further protest against the militarisation of the EU. We insist that the EU remain a civil organisation and that the non-aligned countries' special status is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of the opinion that the future Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU, reassessing the currency union's lack of democracy and its right-wing policies.</p>

I agree with the critical view of the current Treaty, as there was a lack of ambition and political decisiveness needed to give it more political content and to improve the capacity for decision making and participation of the Community institutions, especially Parliament and the Commission, in order to overcome a method of operation that is becoming increasingly markedly intergovernmental. It is very bad that, even in the new areas on which it was agreed in Nice that decisions would be taken by qualified majority, the codecision procedure was not incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I recognise that Nice made the positive contribution of enabling the enlargement process, I do not think that this is enough. In fact, the Member States recognised the limitations of Nice, convening a further IGC for themselves in order to revise the Treaty of Nice in 2004, with specific objectives that will have to be finally fixed in the meeting in Laeken, under the Belgian Presidency, at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the priorities that the Belgian Presidency has announced for this and, in particular, with incorporating the constitutional regions into the debating process on the content of the next Treaty. Of course, I defend the Brussels Declaration signed on Monday of this week by seven constitutional regions, of which Catalonia is one, and we need to ensure that the European regions with legislative powers participate in a very prominent way not only in the preparatory debate, first in Laeken and then at the IGC in 2004, but also in the decision-making processes on the policies of the Union. For the party and coalition represented by <span class="italic">Convergència i Unió</span>, this aspect is of fundamental importance in order to ensure that the citizens of the Union participate in it to a higher degree, and it is obvious that the constitutional regions are already an element of representation, responsibility and contribution on a European level that the Union cannot do without.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate my support for the proposal that the post-Nice debate should become a constitutional process, as this is the best option in order to clarify and fix the political content of the Union in the 21st Century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that some progress was made, but Nice is very far removed from what was expected and needed from it, as the reform agreed on does not serve to make a more efficient and democratic EU in view of enlargement, as is shown, moreover, by the annex on post-Nice that accompanies the final Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Méndez de Vigo-Seguro report should have been more emphatic, because it was important for Parliament to highlight the inadequacies of Nice and send a clear signal about this, which is why I also regret that some of the amendments tabled that were going in that direction did not stand. But aside from this, the report contains some aspects, above all regarding the need to use a method similar to the Convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the need to begin a constitutional process culminating in the adoption of the European Union Constitution, which made me inclined to vote in favour of it, despite my conviction that Nice was a wasted opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, priority should have been given to the content of the European Union and primarily to the question of fulfilling the needs and the rights of all citizens. There should have been a debate about a real charter of social rights and freedoms, rather than about ratifying a cut-price charter of fundamental freedoms. Once the question of content had been raised, the next question to be tackled should have been the question of the equitable funding of European policies, in particular a review of taxation and a demand for democratic management mechanisms that would satisfy those needs. Taxes on capital (Tobin-type taxes) and sanctions on companies that make staff redundant while they are making profits would have been a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We now come to the question of the container. Europe must equip itself with the means to ensure genuine democracy with reference to all the major issues at stake in our society, while respecting the diversity of the peoples of Europe, yet at the same time allowing the emergence of a European citizenship. We must give our workers and our citizens the means of joining in the debate, and influencing issues concerning employment rights and economic choices, placing the governments and the European Central Bank under control.

Nor did we vote against it because it went too far, a complaint voiced among a certain number of schizophrenics who secretly dream of reversing the whole process. We voted against it because, quite simply, it is heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although we are extremely concerned by some of the suggestions that are still being made before this House as soon as there is any mention of the prospect of any further abandoning of sovereignty on the part of the nation states which are the Member States of the Union, we were, nonetheless, pleasantly surprised by some parts of the final version. This was because, on the one hand, at a functional level, it strongly curbs the supranational trend which seeks to bring us, as rapidly as possible, to the total obliteration of States, in favour of a bulimic and uncontrollable Commission, and because, on the other hand, it goes beyond the somewhat petty reservations of some people and persists in preparing for enlargement, thereby reminding us that, before being a standardised and uniform single market, Europe is, in principle and above all, a political structure in which, of course, the peoples of Eastern and Central Europe and the Mediterranean, despite being excluded at the moment, of course have their place.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these sensible reactions, however, the Treaty of Nice was unable to escape from the logic, so fatal to the democracies and peoples of Europe, that in accordance with Declaration 23 on the post-Nice process, the European Union should be committed to a ‘constitutional’ movement which can only lead to a European federal state, the affirmation and future functioning of which are totally incompatible with the continued existence of nation states, whatever the two heads of the French Government, Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin, might think. Moreover, even though political semantics has already had to accommodate other strange bedfellows which are just as incongruous as this impossible idea of a federation of nation States (we only have to think back to the hilarious concept of democratic centralism), history teaches us that, in the end, people will no longer put up with being abused by what is, at best a tragic error, and, at worst, an unforgivable lie.</p>

Instead of finally moving towards subscribing to the European Treaty on Human Rights a Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union was proclaimed, with a completely unclear status. Although the Council long ago lost its <span class="italic">raison d’être </span>as the guardian of national interests, and only plays a part as a guarantee for secrecy and chaos, voting relations within that body turned out to be still more important than the input of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. Nice makes the European labyrinth no less impenetrable and more durable. When it shortly has a possible 30-plus Member States the complex and obscure decision-making of the EU will become hopelessly bogged down. I therefore argue for a different model, without a Council but with more influence for voters. The European Commission makes proposals, the European Parliament takes the final decision and the national parliaments then individually decide whether their Member State will be bound by that decision. It is not a supranational or supranational model, but an interparliamentary one, focused on recognition of democracy and diversity instead of on a multiethnic society that leaves the real decisions to multinationals and NATO. The rapporteur does not offer that alternative. Therefore I myself and a large section of my group will be voting against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All 15 national parliaments in the Member States will ratify the Treaty of Nice in 2001, regardless of the fact that the majority of members of the European Parliament appear to be dissatisfied with it. Therefore, we Swedish Christian Democrats believe that paragraph 42 of today’s report, which addresses issues such as the European Parliament’s assent to the accession treaties, could be worded so as to be much more positive and welcoming. How will this point be received by Estonia, Poland and Cyprus, for example?</p>
<p class="contents">My party cannot approve paragraph 25 of today’s report, which opens the way for the introduction of a European level of tax, and what is more with decision-making rules based on qualified majority voting. All experience shows that new levels of decision-making for taxation lead to higher taxes and less money left for the citizens of the EU, whom we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key issue, apart from tax law, when it comes to the decision-making ability of each national parliament and government is defence policy. Therefore, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party also cannot approve paragraph 31 of the report in question which demands that defence policy be included in ‘enhanced cooperation’ or “flexible integration”.</p>
<p class="contents">We Swedish Christian Democrats are happy about two proposals in the report for historic and vital improvements. The first concerns improvements to the opportunity for citizens and national parliaments to access information about, and to monitor, the Council’s work, by making the meetings of the Council of Ministers open when the Council is adopting legislation. This is an issue which I have consistently brought up in the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and for which I have found increasing support. This is now also the common view of Parliament as a whole. If it is to be possible to talk in terms of democracy – and not just diplomacy – within the EU, this openness must be achieved, i.e. we recommend approval of paragraph 11 of the resolution and Amendment 68.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal is about applying and refining the principle of subsidiarity. There is no single European people, but a great many. There is no single European mother tongue, but a great many. There is no single European nation, but a great many. There is no single European culture, but a great many.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind these circumstances, along with fundamental values such as human rights, democracy, openness, clarity in calls for political responsibility and guarantees of cultural and linguistic equality within the EU, the Swedish Christian Democrats welcome Amendment 77 on clearly delimiting the EU’s political competencies. This is fully in line with the fact that citizens do not want increased distance from the decision-makers and increasing European political centralisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The essential test which it has inflicted upon itself for the next few years, and which is also a historical imperative, is, of course, the task of opting to reconcile the geography of the continent with its history, and to carry on with the enlargement which will now enable democratisation and considerable economic reforms to take place in the Central and Eastern European Countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Nice, which the Méndez de Vigo report tackles and comments on with great honesty and rigour, is first of all a substantial political choice by a Europe which is finally reunited on the question of its founding values of democracy, freedom, solidarity and culture. This is a considerable political ambition for our future, which on its own would justify the ratification of the Treaty of Nice, though it has to be admitted that the Treaty has not provided us with the institutional reforms to enable us to exercise, democratically and consistently, a European political power which is held by at least twenty-seven countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty in reaching agreement at Nice, even among fifteen countries, on the future institutions of the Union, is proof, if proof were needed, of the limitations of the inter-governmental approach in a Union consisting of an even greater number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I welcome the fact that our rapporteur is proposing to create a convention, based on the convention which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in order to make preliminary plans for and to propose to a future IGC a Constitution for the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This step, let us not deny it, will constitute a historic moment in European integration, and its task will be to link our peoples and their future in a way which will be irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why a democratic and public debate, a debate which is open to all our peoples, must precede this pre-constitutional stage, so as to remove any ambiguities about the kind of Europe that we want to build together. Is it to be a political Europe or a business Europe? Is it to be a powerful Europe or a club of countries paralysed by the rule of consensus?</p>
<p class="contents">The public debate decided on at Nice, and the convention method which we have just affirmed here, are the conditions for this imperative, which is to render more democratic the debate on Europe and what is at stake in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Irish people have not been allowed an adequate debate on the impact of the changes proposed in the Treaty of Nice upon Ireland’s sovereignty and Independence. This Treaty does not have to be decided on until the end of 2002, yet the Irish Government is pressurising the Irish people to vote, although they have only had approximately three weeks to digest the minimum information provided to them. The Irish electorate has the right to know what the consequences of the Treaty are for the people of Ireland and Europe as a whole, including candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent national poll, nine out of ten Irish people stated that they did not understand the Treaty of Nice and voter apathy is extremely high. This situation I have no doubt is reflected in other Member states and surely it is not the way to engage citizens to feel politically concerned at local, national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many areas of concern within the Treaty of Nice for a small nation, some of which are: that Ireland cannot be part of enhanced co-operation because of its corporate and energy tax policies; the future loss of veto, the only sure means by which a small country can influence decisions and protect its interests; the undermining of Ireland's neutrality in an increasingly militarised Europe, in which the Treaty of Nice brings an army, called the Rapid Reaction Force, associated with NATO and a military command structure into the EU for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the deepest concern with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, clearly intended to be legally binding in 2004, as a constitution or constitution-treaty, which through the decisions of the EU Court of Justice could take precedence over our Irish Constitution and our Courts. Our Constitution is a finely crafted document, which enshrines the values and beliefs that have sustained the people of Ireland through the best and worst of times.</p>
<p class="contents">It enshrines among other things the constitutional protection of life, marriage and family and should not be vulnerable to decisions made without the full, informed consent of the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly the Christian foundations and heritage of the European Union are conspicuous by their absence from the Charter. Surely an Europe which strives to be a Continental power, proud of its economic progress and intellectual capital should not be afraid to acknowledge its spiritual dimension, a dimension which will lend us strength as we work towards peace and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Nice therefore fits in perfectly well with the ideological approach of its predecessors. It strengthens the supranational institutions and creates new elements of supranationality such as the European political parties or the uniform regulations applying to MEPs. For the first time it lays down in the Treaties the objective of integration, applying it not only at Community level but also, and there is nothing to stop this ideology, at intergovernmental level too.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, is there such an outcry, within this old hotbed of federalism, the European Parliament, against a Treaty which boldly displays the predominant federalist philosophy? Could it be, as Georges Berthu has given us to understand, that with Nice we find ourselves confronted with the expression of a new phase of federalism, which is an even more radical departure from the ‘state’ component, in favour of the component consisting of numbers, of population size? Does this mean, in particular the reweighting of votes within the Council and the Commission, which is closely linked to population levels, and the concept of the demographic verification clause, that the European institutions are being redesigned in such a way as to ensure that the concepts of equilibrium and equality will be obliterated, and their place taken by the domination of those states or groups of states which have the largest populations? If this is true, then we would be heading towards a Europe no longer consisting of equal, and equally respected, states, but a Europe consisting of unequal peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to halt this dangerous trend, calling on the old federalism to combat the new federalism is certainly not the right way to go about it. In order to escape the antidemocratic trends that threaten it, we must rethink European integration, basing it on respect for national democracies.</p>

However, I do not think that the preamble offers any real guarantee on conditions for an enlargement that will be fair to all the countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be binding means that it will not be possible to provide a solid framework for a Europe in which the issue of the greatest deprivation of rights must remain a priority, for example the protection of workers from the arrogance of certain employers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the absence of any clear affirmation of the equality of social, economic and political rights between foreigners or immigrants and European nationals worries me enormously, at a time when the sudden upsurge in the populist xenophobic vote is setting the heart of Europe ablaze, in Austria, Lombardy, Italy and Switzerland, when we see the extreme violence of the ultra-right and extremist movements in Germany, or of the hooligans in Great Britain, or when we consider the fate of thousands of people living in our countries without papers, who are at the mercy of those who traffic in human misery in all its forms. These are serious shortcomings. As for the lack of action following the election violence in Spain, described as a pogrom by commentators, this is not worthy of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fact that the dimension of a Europe turning towards the countries of the south, in particular Africa which is sinking into economic, health and ecological misery, is not really a matter of priority, the fact that there is no provision for simply abolishing the debts of third-world countries and increasing aid to those countries, and also the lack of any thoughts as to how to restore equilibrium between the CFA franc and the dollar, the yen and the euro, all these things will serve only to increase the growing imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the IMF and the World Bank have admitted their responsibility surely means that the development of Africa deserves to be made a priority, in view of our colonial history.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not, of course, detract from the serious work of the rapporteurs and the recent declarations by the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, which both point in the direction of a more fraternal, mutually supportive and just Europe, but which seem to contradict the positions taken up by Mr Schröder and Mr Blair. Our Europe deserves a Treaty of Nice which is along the lines of the recent declarations, or at least closer to the declarations of the two heads of the French Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want enlargement to be more than just an expansion of the market and of the euro zone, Europe must direct its efforts towards the Structural Funds, with the aim of reducing development disparities by assisting the least developed regions of the Union. The present level of funding is insufficient, not only because of the needs of the new populations which are to become integrated into the EU, but also because intolerable inequalities still persist within the Union as it is today.</p>
<p class="contents">Any new European plan will have to be accompanied by a radical transformation in the thinking behind the CAP. The small farmers of Eastern Europe must be able to be included in this redefinition of the CAP (jobs, regional planning, environmental considerations, solidarity with small farmers in the third world, productivism, a subsidies policy that encourages exports). Lastly, enlargement cannot be successful if Europe does not place social issues at the heart of the process, in particular the issue of the living and working conditions of the various peoples.</p>

The Commission drew up an excellent, very balanced and scientific programme, with a great sense of the future, and which aimed to be a document that would arrive in Johannesburg with all the dignity of Europe, proclaiming a viable, feasible environmental policy that is accessible to all and can be implemented and made a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">However, here in Parliament many amendments have been introduced. As a group, we cannot accept any of them. As a group, in order to demonstrate our willingness, we have broadened the usual horizons of the environment and we have added very clear support for the urban environment, which did not previously exist, we have increased interest in the countryside and the rural environment, we have also supported municipal participation, which did not feature in the proposal, and we have also supported public health with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we find that measures have been introduced which are impossible for citizens to comply with. The level has been raised so high that it is impossible even for the enlargement countries to achieve it. We think that we need to govern with our heads and with a spirit of solidarity towards the citizens. We cannot impose things so that we, the Members, get the credit, and profess to belong to the ‘greenest’ group of all, while it is causing major problems for the people.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, with regard to labelling, complying with the standard would require all companies, including the smallest ones, to have a large amount of bureaucracy devoted to filling in labels, and small companies would have to take out civil liability insurance. It would be crazy what the people would have to do if these measures had to be applied. As far as taxes are concerned, a general European tax would fall on the poorest people, those who live outside the cities, etc. For all of these reasons, we voted against the report because we defend the people and a viable and common sense model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The vagueness that characterises the report contains the danger of focussing only on a number of eyecatching items, such as the introduction of the CO2 tax and the Kyoto standard. This report therefore overlooks the central question and specifically the question of how the environment can be better protected than has been the case up to now. Thus far, concentration has been focused mainly on raising charges rather than offering concrete incentives to live in a more environmentally aware way. In addition they are completely neglecting the absolute necessity of achieving harmonisation at international level, because for as long as we are incapable of doing that, it will create a negative effect, mainly for Europe, and it will prove an obstacle to trade.

I often happen to talk to elderly people and pensioners and so I have also discussed the environment with them, which we have regulated so much here in this beautiful chamber in Brussels and in the even more beautiful and larger chamber in Strasbourg. In our conversations they have expressed a doubt, a problem. They have told me, ‘With your reports, with your environmental programmes, to whom are you trying to give good, clean air to breathe, for whom are you trying to have beautiful countryside, for whom are you trying to make life better? The young, the middle-aged, the old?’ Here it is, then: what I see as missing in these plans is the objective of having a clean environment for the elderly, who are the ones who need it most.

However, we must not forget that the public has enormous power, via demand, and it can therefore guide environmental considerations in relation to business investment.

In addition, and despite the fact that the environment knows no geographical boundaries, it is essential that the European legislators should respect the principle of subsidiarity, in other words, they should not over-regulate at European level, but should leave it to the national authorities to define sustainable development at local level, since it is a concept which includes not only environmental protection but also the economic and social context which is essential to human beings.</p>

The intentions, ambitions and priorities of those proposals are often praiseworthy, but the clarification of the objectives (what exactly is sustainable development?) and the definition of the policies, the resources and the time scales, are still extremely vague.</p>
<p class="contents">When it is a question of imposing liberal economic reforms and defending the individual interests of private financial powers, the Council issues restrictive regulations. When it comes to facing up to the ecological crisis and thereby defending the collective interests of the population, all it does is issue very general professions of faith. The contrast is striking, and it is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">The ecological crisis, which is now of human origin, is fuelled by the predatory behaviour of this liberal capitalism which the Council is in favour of. The implementation of a policy of sustainable development requires a radical change of direction in the area of economics, a change of direction which the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties seek to prohibit in the name of commercial competition, employers’ rights and freedom for private investment. There are two alternatives: defending large shareholders on the one hand, and ecological requirements (as well as other, more numerous, social needs) on the other.

Instead of dividing the existing yield of our natural resources more fairly, we strove for ever-increasing returns in order to make everyone less poor or even richer. Air, water and soil pollution together with soil erosion, floods and landslides are a cross-border problem, that we should wish to solve even without the existence of a European Union. The listing of objectives and means as a way to achieving this in a programme of action is a first step. Even if it concerns painful means, such as Amendment No 21, which puts an end to subsidies for the use of coal. The next step is to crush the opposition of those who still regard opting for the environment as harmful to their own interests. Some States and some large corporations still regard profit and growth as much more important. The US government and the oil companies that helped to bring that government to power do not regard it as their concern that climate change will result in the expansion of seas and deserts, so that a portion of the land area of the earth will become uninhabitable. I see the sixth Environment Action Programme, and especially the tightening up of ends and means proposed by the rapporteur and the three draftsmen, as a signal that the European people do not wish to resign themselves to the impotence that America is trying to impose on us. </p>

This directive, it has to be admitted, made a contribution to road safety in the European Union, inasmuch as it made it compulsory to wear safety belts and to use child restraint systems. Such provisions are essential as they make it possible to reduce the severity of injuries in the case of an accident. Research into accidents has shown that, for children who are not restrained by an appropriate system, the risk of being seriously injured is seven times higher than for those who are restrained.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would seem essential to revise this ten-year-old text. Under current legislation, for example, children less than three years of age can use an ordinary rear-seat belt. As the father of young children, I am in a good position to condemn this state of affairs, which places their health and their lives at risk. The restraint systems currently available on the market are sufficiently well designed to enable their use to be made compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of child restraint systems must therefore be further harmonised and made more certain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal also extends the scope of the directive by including in it the wearing of a safety belt, by the driver and seated passengers, in all motor vehicles which are suitably equipped.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, though satisfactory, is not sufficiently precise. That is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism wanted to provide additional details. These include the launching of an information campaign about the danger posed by an air bag to a child transported in a rear-facing safety seat fitted to the front passenger seat of a vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to safety conditions for children less than 12 years old, I believe, like the rapporteur, that it is more logical to take their height into account rather than their weight, because they do not need special restraints if they are at least 150 cm tall.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring the safety of our children is a collective responsibility. I therefore voted for all the amendments which work towards that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will make safety belt systems compulsory in cars up to 3.5 tons. Backward facing child seats will also be forbidden unless the airbag is disabled and passengers will have to wear belts in every vehicle fitted with them.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is gratified that her amendments have been adopted. As a result child seats will apply to children not only below twelve but are also shorter than 150 cm. There is also demand for an “airbag information campaign” to warn against transporting children in seats when the air bag is activated. "Smart" airbags might be a solution. And finally the manufacturer should give the consumer better information on which seats are best suited to children.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal aim of the regulation is to reduce the inconsistencies caused by difference in application of the present ordinance in the Member States. As a result the regulation will become more transparent and more predictable. Problems in intracommunal traffic will be solved because legislation in the Member States will be brought into line.</p>
<p class="contents">There was some discussion on the question to what extent this regulation is a community power or a power of the Member States. After studying this question of subsidiarity carefully, I believe that European legislation is required here to increase transparency in the field of compulsory seat belts and seatbelt use. It is a shared competence based on Article 251 of the Treaty. The fragmented legislation in the Member States cannot be tackled by the implementation of a uniform Regulation at community level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On this point, I should like to point out that, while I agree with the idea that one should not discriminate against fathers either, the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this amendment because there will always be a difference between ‘maternity’ and ‘paternity’. Unless the present order of things changes, men cannot become pregnant and cannot, therefore, give birth. Moreover, this amendment is something of a muddle, so that those of us who like good, solid, legal texts cannot agree to it.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the final voting is concerned, many of us were unable to vote in favour of the report because, against our wishes, amendments such as Amendments Nos 4, 36 and 44 were adopted. As the Commissioner has said, they are unacceptable because they ignore the most basic procedures, and in particular the provisions of the Treaty. If this Parliament is a co-legislator, it should not confuse a legislative text with a resolution, in which one can reveal all kinds of wishful thinking. A legislative text must be capable of implementation. Let us not forget, either, that in seeking to give women at work all-round protection, we run the risk of impairing and endangering their access to employment and their chances of promotion. Please, let us stop getting so worked up over sexual harassment, and finally, in this area as in others, let us not ignore the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why many of the members of my group were unable to vote in favour of this report. I await the second reading, and I hope that the wisdom of the Council will be brought to bear on the irrational proposals which we have adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inclusion of positive action in favour of women, the distinctions made between direct and indirect discrimination, the definition of sexual harassment, and the claim that women, at the end of their maternity leave or after adopting or fostering a child, should have the right to go back to their own job in the same way as men do when they have been on leave, all these are intended to combat discrimination and to achieve greater equality between women and men in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to tackle the question of the initial training which, via our schools, accustoms children, from a very early age, to the sexual division of tasks and thus to the inequalities which we find in the world of work and which these amendments are intended to combat. In the same way, we must also introduce and integrate compulsory measures to ensure that the laws or directives adopted are fully complied with. For example, in France, despite the equal rights laid down by law, the difference in pay between men and women is still, on average, 27%.

<p class="contents">The proposed reform of the Financial Regulation applicable to the budget of the Union, which the European Commission is submitting to the Council of Ministers, is certainly one of the major texts of this legislature, a text which will govern the finances of Europe for a long time to come. That shows just how important the new version of this text, which we have before us today, will be to the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are six vital areas covered by this unprecedented reform proposal: the reaffirmation of the principles of budgetary law, the execution of the budget, markets and subsidies, accounting and the presentation of accounts, external measures of the European Union, and other major aspects such as the discharge procedure, the EAGGF Guarantee Section, the Structural Funds, research and development, OLAF and administrative appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">On 16 May, the Committee on Budgets, when adopting Mr Dell'Alba’s draft report, pointed out, quite rightly, that the fact that the Financial Regulation takes precedence over all other financial rules and regulations should be explained in its enacting terms. It also requested, we believe with good reason, that the budget heading to which receipts are allocated should be clearly defined, as should the purpose of the appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee also expressed itself in favour of integrating into the Community budget all the European Agencies, including future agencies. However, to integrate these agencies into the annual vote of the budget authority would have the effect of making them lose their autonomy, despite the fact that they were created precisely to be autonomous, and the European Parliament already votes on their annual subsidy and their discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, as far as these agencies are concerned, it is worth pointing out, quite apart from the fact that they ought to remain independent, that OLAF is dependent upon the Commission, whereas Europol and Eurojust are funded by national budgets.</p>

<p class="contents">Ten years after the concept of sustainable development was recognised as the development system that can reconcile economy and ecology, despite a whole host of standards and regulations, on the whole the environment has suffered more than it has gained as a result of development.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the concept of sustainable development seems to be understood by the Commission and certain Member States, this is almost certainly not the case in all fifteen Member States. Even some Members of the Commission still imagine that economic development in the long term can be adjusted simply by adding a dash of environment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is all very well for the European Union to talk about wanting sustainable development. The fact is, that its policies on agriculture, the economy, transport, energy, foreign affairs and development persist in demonstrating that the reverse is true. The environmental aspect still ends up playing the Cinderella role.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is clearly reflected in the reports tabled before the European Parliament. The resolutions have succeeded in giving practical expression to our responsibilities and obligations in the face of the continuous deterioration of our planet, global warming, and the disappearance of biodiversity, and they serve as a reminder that only a completely new approach to policies can hope to reverse these trends.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as they go, all these proposals, the abolition of subsidies which have a harmful impact on the environment, the introduction of ecotaxes, environmental responsibility, making WTO reform conditional upon environmental aspects, the annual assessment of policy progress using credible criteria, are moving in the right direction. However, will the Council and the Commission have the courage to take into account the position of the European Parliament? We cannot count on it. Despite the clear thinking behind policies dealing with global warming, and the undertakings that have been given either orally or enshrined in treaties, guidelines or other international agreements, as yet these pious wishes have been put into practice on only a very modest scale. Remember that greenhouse-gas emissions would have to be reduced by 80-90% over a period of 50 years in order to halt the global-warming process. So far, a figure of only 8% has been agreed</p>
<p class="contents">The Fifteen know what is at stake. Will they have the heart and the courage, at Gothenburg, to change direction and change gear, by daring to get to grips with the issues of CAP reform, transport pollution, and energy? If not, it will be with full knowledge of the facts that they will have to take on board the economic, social, environmental and financial consequences of their political inconsistency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur rightly starts from the principle of voluntary mobility of people going to work in another Member State or in Switzerland. But what does voluntary mean? Did those who came <span class="italic">en masse </span>from the Mediterranean in the 1960s to work in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, come voluntarily, or were they forced by poverty, unemployment and dictatorship? There is still much more work migration in America than in Europe. Someone who loses his job there must take a job thousands of kilometres away, often an insecure job that pays worse than the previous one. Because it is not necessary there to regard it as emigration to another country, and people are also remaining in the same language area, the government considers it normal that people should be cut off from family and friends. Europeans are protected from such pressure as long as no one can force them to look for work abroad or in another language area. It is much better to bring work to people that to take people to work. But it is precisely on this count that a liberal economy falls down, which concentrates all activity in areas with a favourable location for traffic. It is precisely under those circumstances that a single European labour market does not work to the advantage of employees or of society as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
