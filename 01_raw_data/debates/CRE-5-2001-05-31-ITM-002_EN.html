<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ribeiro e Castro (UEN),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although EURES was created in 1993, as the successor to the old SEDOC, few people are even aware that it exists. Few people know what EURES does, which is to help people looking for work in another Union country or employers to recruit applicants in another country. Few people understand what EURES could mean for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first recommendation, therefore, seeks to publicise EURES and its database more intensively, which must be reflected in its budget, in its activity plan and in the implementation of its budget and also in the various Member States, where it should be monitored and followed up appropriately by their public employment services, which are now linked by means of EURES.</p>
<p class="contents">EURES is a network of networks, consisting of around 500 ‘Euroadvisers’, public and private organisations and partners and provides a valuable opportunity for direct consultation via the Internet in an open network. It seeks to promote the transparency of the European market by providing information, advice and placement help. EURES covers not only the Union, but also the European Economic Area and currently includes 17 countries. In short, it seeks to promote the effective exercise of the right to free movement of workers and encourage mobility, which we consider not to be a political end in itself, but rather the need to respond to people’s spontaneous requests.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this makes little sense, however, if people are fundamentally unaware of its existence. The first priority is, therefore, to promote and to publicise this programme. As a matter of fact, as a result of growing Internet use, the efficiency of EURES will increasingly depend on the widespread knowledge of the general public and much less on simple improvements to the workings of the bureaucratic network of services and organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">One specific sector of EURES deserves a special mention, which is the area dedicated to cross-border cooperation in the field of employment and labour mobility, and which clearly generates a higher level of response: the cross-border EURES. Today, there are already twenty specific structures in this field, but a great deal remains to be done. I would remind you, in particular, of the case of my country’s border with Spain, which is largely ‘bare’, and I am also thinking of the new challenges and opportunities that the forthcoming enlargement will bring to this field. As a result of the considerable potential that these EURES cross-border structures offer in terms of local development, decentralised social dialogue and specific development of cross-border mobility, being able to work in another country without changing residence is clearly another priority for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the 1998-1999 period, which the Commission’s report covers, we see positive data that we have highlighted. The report also contains some negative aspects to bear in mind, which we must correct straightaway. These include the considerable lack of public awareness, to which I have already referred, the low take-up in relative terms by employers’ organisations, the very high national imbalance in the participation of the various Member States, a fact which is disturbing and unacceptable, some shortcomings that have been noticed with regard to the web site, specifically in terms of its multilingual nature, which serves to provide an equal basis for all European citizens, and the absence of any mention of the outermost regions. We therefore also request that particular attention be paid in future to these regions’ specific problems in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the Commission’s report itself contains some shortcomings, which we have highlighted. These are the absence of any diagnosis and a lack of assessment of the crux of the matter, in terms both of the development of the service itself and of the true state of labour mobility in the Union and the European Economic Area. The future reports by EURES will be much more useful and will make much more political sense if they present their critical vision of the successes and failures that have been notched up, if they include information which is more relevant, both in terms of statistics and of quality, if they better enable us to make a more accurate assessment of the definition of priorities of future goals and targets and if they also enable us to undertake a proper parliamentary assessment of the reasons underpinning the choices that are made.</p>
<p class="contents">This revamping of the future biennial reports from EURES and their content is, as a matter of fact, specifically called for in the conclusions of the last Spring Summit, in Stockholm, particularly those that were adopted following the Commission’s communication to the Council entitled ‘New European Labour Markets, Open to All, with Access for All’, which we are closely watching, which we welcome and which we warmly recommend should be followed up in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose a programme geared towards enlargement, a programme of preparatory action, which we would like to be accessible and appropriate. Furthermore, once a new legal basis for the organisation of EURES is announced, probably in 2002, Parliament will only need to say one simple thing, and that is: Parliament wishes to participate in this redefinition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the role of EURES, a network which is intended to provide information, advice and employment services across national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with all the key points contained in Mr Ribeiro e Castro's report. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his competent work. In particular, we share his critical views – which he has just repeated during this debate – under Recital A, which sets out a clear set of conditions for the Commission as regards the provision of objective reasons and statistical information. This will also make our job easier.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report – like so many others – succumbs to a common temptation: it adds a lengthy list of new demands for future improvements to those already put forward by the Commission. In my view, the repetition of what is self-evident, and this House's often over-zealous efforts to list every conceivable demand, simply detract from the impact of a report and the credibility of our joint endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">I often have the impression that if the Commission puts forward five demands, for example, this House feels compelled to add at least another five. I cannot support this approach. What is important is not the number of demands we put forward in a specific case but their practical implementation. I think it is excessive, for example, to devise and implement permanent information systems, in particular within youth organisations, universities and the media, as demanded in Article 15 of the report. I think this is something which we can safely leave to the EURES units at local level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have great reservations about the creation of additional operational units, as set forth in Article 16, because they lack substance and are often used as a fig leaf in order to conceal the failures of existing bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The growing importance of EURES' role in the light of the forthcoming EU enlargement must be clearly underlined, as in this report. Sound career advice and employment services can undoubtedly help to channel potential widespread interest in migration. Nonetheless, the goal of further integration of the labour market within the Fifteen must not slip into the background.</p>
<p class="contents">What is absolutely essential is the restructuring of EURES' finances and the reform of its legal basis, as demanded in Article 27. This is borne out by the problems at local level and the enquiries directed to us as parliamentarians. As the representation of citizens at local level, Parliament must be given a key role in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unlike Mr Stauner I am convinced that he has produced very creative work with the report of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union wants to make the creation of an integrated labour market a priority and that is a good thing. But we should be aware that people who want to make use of this opportunity are not always wrapped in cotton wool. It is not at all easy to be mobile in a cross-border way in the European labour market. If we really want a European labour market, we must work at removing the obstacles, and EURES has certainly won its spurs in this field. The 450 EURES consultants who have day-to-day contact with people who are mobile, can testify to the difficulties they experience.</p>
<p class="contents">But even in their own organisations, whether it be job centres or trade unions, they do not always receive the attention they really deserve. I believe that policy-makers should make more use of their know-how and expertise. I am therefore particularly happy that the Commission has agreed to my suggestion that a public hearing should be organised with the EURES consultants and I hope, Commissioner, that the results of that hearing will be of use to the Commission in preparing the new programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has formulated a number of proposals and the honourable Member has supplemented these in a useful way. I believe, for example, that it is a very good idea to use EURES more effectively as part of our employment strategy and for that to happen the legal basis of EURES must change. I also think it is important that there is better coordination with other Community initiatives. But I should like to put special emphasis on two additional elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: I believe that it is definitely necessary to start expanding EURES activities in the future, especially in the context of enlargement to include new candidate countries which we are now experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: anyone who talks about the enlargement and enhancement of EURES must also have the courage to talk about additional financial resources and preferably, Commissioner, as part of a long-term plan, since the annual ‘carve up’ is very difficult to operate for EURES.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take advantage of this debate to raise two additional issues regarding cross-border mobility, issues about which we are constantly asked by people in border regions. That is first and foremost, Commissioner, the question of Parliament that has been on the table for years in relation to the introduction of a Europe test, a test which could monitor internationally the possible consequences of social and fiscal legislation in other countries. The Netherlands recently used that test voluntarily as part of a bilateral tax agreement and in the social agenda we have occasionally asked for such a test to be created at European level. I should like to ask you again to give this serious consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the draft for the simplification and modification of the coordination of social security entitlements of migrating employees. This issue has been on the table for years, and we know that the Belgian presidency intends to, and will try to, achieve a political breakthrough in this connection. That will not be easy while decisions on this issue must be made unanimously. Accordingly, I should like to express the hope that Member States that are at present dragging their feet will begin paying more attention to the problems of cross-border mobility, and hence be prepared to make some compromises as part of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission promised us that at the end of this year, during the Belgian Presidency, a conference on border work would be organised. We very much hope, Commissioner, that that conference will contribute, not only to greater understanding and insight into the problems of border regions, but specifically to the removal of the obstacles to cross-border mobility in the European labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that working abroad is increasingly popular for young people, in particular, and businesses are also looking to recruit from a wider field, but for this to be possible, people need to feel that they can have accurate, up-to-date information about what working in another Member State may entail, because that information provides them with a real choice as to whether they work elsewhere or not.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we have a very confusing set of different rules and regulations and it is clear from complaints to many of us and to Parliament's Petitions Committee that clear advice is not always forthcoming from the appropriate authorities, even in Member States themselves. The apparent anomalies have not helped either in social security coordination and entitlements, even different definitions as to what constitutes self-employment. The EURES network provides a very valuable resource for potential mobile workers. It also provides a valuable, if underused, resource for employers. Many small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity or experience to carry out their cross-border recruitment. EURES has an important role for them and it is a great pity that employment and employers' organisations are not more involved in the development of these services.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, it has been particularly important in border regions, but EURES still does not cover all such areas, which is regrettable. It is obvious, as others have said, that EURES needs to be adequately resourced, expanded and promoted if it is to meet its full potential and respond to the needs of individuals. We must also recognise that enlargement will bring additional and quite legitimate demands in terms of information.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the request for more detailed information to be provided and agree that multi-annual funding is essential to the smooth development of this services. However, its task would be made much easier if Member States adopted a more determined and coherent approach to making free movement a reality rather than an ideal that they keep banging on about, but seem incapable of delivering. There has to be positive action by governments in favour of enabling people to experience working elsewhere: Mrs Van Lancker has already refereed to the coordination of social security systems within this. There is also the question about dealing with tax problems for frontier workers. We still have enormous problems with adequate recognition of qualifications, particularly vocational qualifications. Members States must recognise that free movement is not a threat to them, it is not an inconvenience, it is a valuable way to increase understanding and to develop cooperation within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with most of what has been brought up in the discussion, especially by the speakers immediately preceding me.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add two comments. Firstly, I would like to say how glad I am that the report so clearly emphasises that the free movement we want in Europe must be based on the principle of voluntary mobility. I highlight this particularly in view of the fact that, in my own and other countries, employment services have often been used as a kind of instrument with which to force population movements between different parts of the country through economic means. I hope that it will never be possible to implement any such measure at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that I am surprised that no-one in this discussion has pointed out that we are now discussing technical and practical obstacles to free movement across borders, at the same time as major Member States are setting up huge practical and political obstacles to free movement between the labour markets of the candidate countries and those of the current Member States. This suggests, of course, that we are concerned with a political rather than a solely practical problem when we talk about free movement in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I commend him for the extensive work he has put into the preparation and completion of this report and I share his view that we need to stress the important role of EURES network, as a means of implementing European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">EURES job offers went from 43 000 at the start of 1998 to 166 000 at the beginning of 2000. The number of placements obtained to EURES, rose from 26 449 in 1998 to 44 460 in 1999: that is an increase of more than 68% in one year and the potential for more placement is much greater. This is just another example of the many qualitative examples of the EU at work for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland. The fact that we have come close to full employment is a practical example of what is achievable. I am confident our people will give practical recognition to this fact when they vote next week on the Nice Treaty. We want to share the benefits of EU membership with our neighbours from central and eastern Europe: to do otherwise would be to reject the concept and spirit of the Rome Treaty. Let us not forget their courage and sacrifice in safeguarding freedom and democracy. This objective surely outweighs other minor or contrived objections to Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key functions of EURES is to make information available on current job vacancies in the Member States. Yesterday evening, I logged on to the website and there were 7 197 vacancies listed. Looking at the first 200 vacancies, the range of jobs is extensive. Vacancies in Ireland, for example, include: accounts assistants, building administrators and sales and reservations. So for all of the reasons, it is very obvious that this EURES programme has enormous potential. Again, I compliment and congratulate my colleague, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on his very extensive and constructive approach to this important report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the rapporteur requires more information on the results of the EURES network. I fully support that, since it definitely remains obscure how the results of EURES relate to the state of affairs in European labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission document shows clearly that Member States could make fuller use of the potential of the EURES network, in view of the differences between Member States in the number of vacancies in the network: international recruitment will not be realistic for all vacancies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way the call to encourage all border regions to enter into a EURES partnership has not been supported with arguments based on the need for community support expressed by the regions themselves. The obstacles are not found in the first place between adjacent regions, but concern mobility over greater distances, that is, they are ‘transnational’ rather than ‘cross-border’ in nature. EU enlargement implies that a shift in emphasis from cross-border to transnational mobility will become more likely.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the necessary subsidiarity. Both the Commission and the rapporteur raise the point that local familiarity with the network leaves much to be desired. However, local information is the responsibility of the local players. For that reason, reserving a substantial portion of the budget for promotion is undesirable. On the other hand, I can fully support the call for decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The term of the budget is also a discussion point. The Commission wants a budget extending over several years as this facilitates planning. I have no problems with long-term budgets as such, but I do with the scope and nature of the community package of responsibilities proposed by the Commission. That leads me to prefer an annual establishment of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion the attention paid by the rapporteur to expansion has my support. After the political decision on the free movement of employees is taken for the candidate countries, the mobility of labour must no longer be restricted by inadequate cooperation in employment provision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that in my country, France, by massaging the figures and by introducing costly job-creation schemes in the public sector which are no real use at all, the government has been able to announce what it claims is a spectacular fall in unemployment. In reality, unemployment remains stable, and it may even be increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of the year, planned job cuts have been followed by more planned job cuts, at Marks and Spencer, who are relocating, and at Danone, who are planning even further cuts. We are quick to condemn companies who make staff redundant while they themselves are making a profit, but governments must also bear their share of the responsibility, because the original European plan for free circulation and competition between countries with comparable living standards and social protection schemes has been replaced by the indiscriminate opening up of the market to capital and to products manufactured outside Europe in conditions approaching slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">For those companies who are subject to laws imposed by parliaments and states, the employment market is not only European, but world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">For workers, of course, it is another matter, and I note that, quite rightly, Recital C in Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s report says that ‘a high level of mobility on the labour market is not an end in itself’. Two hundred thousand French people, worn down by the weight of taxation and the endless bureaucracy in their own country, did not wait for EURES, but simply left the country, in order, finally to get a job and a better standard of living, at least that is what they were hoping for, in the United Kingdom. So, while it is certainly useful to have a network which enables those who wish to find a job in another country within the European Union, our first priority must continue to be to make it possible for businesses to create jobs for their own people in their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basis for the EURES network is the existence of this right, enshrined in law, for workers to move freely within the territory of the European Union and the European Economic Area and the unpleasant fact that barriers to labour mobility remain in place. This network, which centres on the exchange of information, on providing advice and on support for appointing professionals, is supported by EURES advisers in dialogue and in collaboration with the Member States’ national employment services and by an Internet access service. This service must be more widely publicised in future, which will make it easier for the average user to consult and research. EURES contributes to making the European employment market more flexible and increasingly mobile and provides a range of opportunities for vocational training in cross-border regions. The positive characteristics of this network, which must be strengthened, as the rapporteur, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, whom I congratulate, quite rightly emphasises, include ease of access and the exchange of information on employment opportunities across this huge area, the multilingual content of the system, which must be regularly and rigorously updated, and legal assistance for citizens, particularly with tax systems and social security.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we must not overestimate the value of EURES. Although this network is a very positive thing, it is merely an instrument for implementing the European strategy for employment. The truth of the matter is that specific directives do exist in the field of employment, which seek to eliminate the social, cultural, and linguistic barriers that obstruct mobility in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner, Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his analysis of the Commission’s report. The analysis which he has carried out is very painstaking, and it really does enable us to ask ourselves about the relevance and, the effectiveness of this European Employment Service, both in terms of its strategy and objectives and in relation to the resources which have been used in order to achieve the objective of worker mobility and access to the European employment market.</p>
<p class="contents">Like previous speakers, I should like to emphasise the value of the activity report. I should also like, however, to draw attention to its weakness, which lies in its lack of critical evaluation. However, the text presented by our rapporteur will supplement the report as far as this aspect is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is timely, insofar as it highlights the role which EURES can and should play in the more general context of the European employment strategy, particularly if, as has been requested, the question of its having its formal legal basis in the Treaties is reviewed. EURES should be entirely integrated into the strategy, defined at Lisbon and reinforced at Stockholm, on the removal of obstacles to mobility within the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that there are three points which need emphasising. First there is the issue of mobility, which has already been mentioned. Everyone praises its merits, but I do not believe that it should be regarded as an end in itself, or as a risky gamble on the future, and still less as a choice that is made by default because there are no job opportunities at home. It must be possible for it to be a positive choice, and in that case mobility should not have to face all sorts of obstacles with regard to consistency between social security systems and taxation systems, double taxation, and the recognition of qualifications etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let us emphasise the importance of information on the existence of the European Employment Service, particularly in border regions. Communications must be strengthened, and addressed as a matter of priority to professional organisations, training centres and universities. The added value of the European dimension is not necessarily clear to see, and yet the fact that this Community strategy in favour of employment is taking the very practical form of providing openings in the employment market at European level is an excellent example of what can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to end my speech by mentioning the question of enlargement. In view of the fears which have been expressed here and there in certain Member States of the Union, regarding the prospect of the massive and uncontrolled arrival of workers from the candidate countries, I believe that EURES should have a role to play here, by making it possible to anticipate difficulties, whether real or imagined, in particular by facilitating dialogue and by making it possible for the employment services of the countries concerned to work together with the various social partners involved in the major issue of job mobility in the Union as it is today and in the enlarged Union of tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, employment strategies, guidelines and recommendations have been of a strictly national nature. But national action plans relate to national labour markets and what we refer to as the European labour market is clearly developing throughout Europe. By which we mean new demands, identical demands regarding the quality of the qualifications of people looking for jobs throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is very little mobility of workers within Europe. A mere 0.4%. The standard response to mobility problems is to cite cultural differences. The question of language, culture and national education systems. However, there is clearly more to it than that. There are pension problems and insurance problems and regulations on movements of workers and their pensions need to work better and faster, as we have already heard. There is the important problem of information, which several speakers have already touched on; the information which jobseekers need to be given on their rights, labour market conditions, accommodation, their children's education, their pension rights and the facility to transfer their rights if they return home. These are problems of a national and European nature; they are already on the agenda of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but there are still huge differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">EURES is instrumental to the creation of this European labour market. Parliament is supporting the Commission in this endeavour, as it has done since 1993, as can be seen from this year's budget, which is in the order of EUR 13 million. EURES already has operational experience and there has been an increase in the demand for information, an increase in the movement of information at transnational level, which reached 40% last year, proving that we need to keep and expand EURES.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch on certain choices made by the Commission in order to promote and strengthen this tool. First, there is greater collaboration between the heads of public services, more and more of which are deciding to incorporate EURES in their databases, so that they can provide their customers with common services. We are currently studying the possibility of extending the range of services to both jobseekers and employers. The Commission will announce a new EURES service from June onwards which will allow jobseekers in specific sectors in which there is a shortage to file their CVs via the Internet and, at the same time, will allow employers to register for this service.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that it has been up and running for 8 years, we have asked the Member States to include problems or new services which might be demanded of EURES in their questionnaires and we shall be presenting Parliament with a report based on these questionnaires.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by pointing out that enlargement will force us to reconsider this tool; for the moment, however, we need to develop it between the Member States to the maximum. Finally, I think it is worth mentioning that the legal basis for EURES needs to be revised, so that EURES can be adapted and improved to meet the future demands on these services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
