<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, on 10 October 2003, the World Day Against the Death Penalty, I adopted a public declaration on behalf of the European Union which clearly stated: ‘The European Union calls upon countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty to at least introduce a moratorium as a first step towards complete abolition.’ This, I repeat, is the declaration that I myself adopted just a few days ago on behalf of the European Union: a text agreed upon by everybody. I say this because even before that, as a representative of the Italian Government, I can say that Italy has always been firmly convinced that the battle for the abolition of the death penalty is of great political and idealistic value, as well as having a very important humanitarian aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all of us Europeans are sure that the process leading to the complete abolition of the death penalty is irreversible, but also that this process has to be a gradual one. That is why we must ask ourselves how we should act in practical terms so that the sacrifice of human life that it inevitably requires can be stopped for good. These are the concerns that have led the Italian Presidency to accept the invitation of this House and many other parliaments, including the one in my country, to propose to the governments of the countries of Europe a European Union resolution initiative on a moratorium, to be put before the current United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berlusconi spoke in the same vein here in Parliament on 2 July this year; this commitment is founded on concerns that we all share, as reflected in the report and resolution on human rights in the world, adopted by the European Parliament on 4 September. In the debate within the European Union, a major ethical problem, which is a question, has arisen. People have wondered: Is pursuing the complete abolition of the death penalty compatible – I repeat, is it compatible – with an initiative such as the moratorium, which is based on governments’ willingness not to apply the death penalty in practice in their countries? There are also more strictly political considerations. Is there, people have wondered, a sufficient level of agreement for the resolution to be adopted in the General Assembly? How much might a possible defeat affect the future of the campaign for the total abolition of the death penalty? If the data really confirm that there is a trend towards an expansion of the abolitionist front, we wonder: is it now worth running the risk of the resolution failing – given the uncertainty of the outcome – or might it not be better to wait until our position has been further consolidated?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the questions that have been asked. The Italian Presidency has been giving considerable thought to these serious questions, because Europe obviously cannot and must not appear divided or uncertain on a subject as important and sensitive as this one. We have weighed up the pros and cons. We have mobilised our whole diplomatic network to try to understand, to get an idea – so to speak – of voting intentions on a possible resolution for a moratorium. The result of this survey, which we have carried out in all the diplomatic offices, seems to indicate that a suitably formulated text might be approved by the General Assembly, although, of course, that is not a certainty. The fact remains, however, that many countries whose history would suggest that they should be in favour of a resolution of this sort have not expressed their position on our question, and we should not ignore the risk that, if amendments are tabled on the text of a resolution such as this, the united front of supporting countries might suffer some major defections when it comes to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency – and the Italian Government, at a national level – are very conscious of the demand made by this Parliament, the European Parliament, just as, in Italy, we are conscious of the mission that the Italian Parliament has given us to put a resolution on a moratorium before the General Assembly. On the other hand, it is quite clear to us that many governments within the European Union are still rather baffled and are wondering how best to pursue this objective, which we all share. We are convinced that a European initiative to put a resolution before the General Assembly would be politically well-timed and morally very worthwhile, and we have been and still are working towards this, so that the question can remain a subject for examination and careful consideration by the foreign ministers. We are aware that concern over a defeat, despite the general positive feeling, is prevailing over any inclination to table a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as the Italian Government, uphold this commitment at a national level, but, as the holder of the European Presidency, Italy still hopes that the outcome of this careful consideration will be a European decision to go ahead with tabling the resolution. This would be a decision consistent with Europe’s commitment to oppose the death penalty. That is why I am once again calling for some careful consideration. I know time is short, and I know this consideration has to lead to a decision very swiftly. I hope there will be either a joint decision of all the countries of Europe to share responsibility for tabling a resolution of this kind – which would be by far the best option – or a European decision that clearly leaves the path clear for national initiatives on this subject by European countries, including, perhaps, the Italian Government acting at a national level. If the initiative comes from Europe, it will certainly have greater force; if it comes from the governments of European countries it will certainly have less force but it will be equally important. I am still waiting for the representatives of the European Governments – and I shall be giving them a reminder – to give me their judgment and final opinion on one or other of these possible solutions within a very short time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, you are entirely correct in saying that I have addressed Parliament on a number of previous occasions on the death penalty and I have had to observe occasionally in the past that when I first used to make speeches in a Parliament on the death penalty, I did not find such unanimity of support for my views. I remember voting for the abolition of capital punishment in various parts of the British Isles, not always with great support. The first act that I carried out when I was a colonial oppressor was to abolish capital punishment in Hong Kong! So I have a certain amount of 'form' on this issue, as football managers would say.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I straightaway apologise for the fact that I will not be able to stay for the whole of this debate. I have to catch an aeroplane for Madrid for the Iraq Donors' Conference which is beginning tomorrow morning, and where, of course, the presidency will also be represented. I hope Parliament will excuse me of any discourtesy, but my colleague, Mr Fischler, will be coming to sit here to report anything that I should have heard later in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope also that Parliament will excuse me if a good deal of what I say treads in the elegant footsteps of the presidency. I want to put many of the same points, but in my own way. Parliament knows that we consistently work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty. In the process of attaining this objective, where the death penalty still exists, we call for its use to be progressively restricted, we insist that it should be carried out with the minimum cruelty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also presses, where relevant, for moratoria to be introduced. We have produced internal guidelines for démarches and representations on capital punishment, where relevant, in multilateral fora and towards third countries. At the European summit with China last year, the then Prime Minister of China, Zhu Rongii, said: 'you just talk about these issues to poorer countries don't you?' I pointed out to him that the first time I recalled us raising the issue was with the United States. So it is an issue that we raise –I must say that the United States Secretary of State was slightly surprised! – with everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is a long-standing opponent of the death penalty and has been instrumental in promoting this process. Parliament has declared in the past that it considers capital punishment, and I quote, 'an inhuman, medieval form of punishment, unworthy of modern societies'. A series of initiatives have been taken to ensure that the abolition of the death penalty should become a key element of European human rights policy. It is on the basis of this strongly held European policy objective that for the last years we have successfully tabled resolutions in the UN Commission on Human Rights on the death penalty, as the President-in-Office has said. The seventh consecutive resolution was adopted in Geneva on 24 April.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution contains some significant new features. It calls, in particular, on states not to carry out executions in public or in any other degrading manner and to ensure that any application of particularly cruel or inhuman means of execution, such as stoning, be stopped immediately. While the support for resolutions on the death penalty in the Commission on Human Rights has increased, it has to be said that opposition has increased as well. The resolution adopted in Geneva received the support of 24 states, while 18 voted against and 10 abstained. However, the strong disagreement of many states was proved by the fact that 63 countries signed a statement dissociating themselves from the resolution. I thought it would be useful to recall these facts in the context of today's debate on a resolution requesting a moratorium on the death penalty in the General Assembly Third Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">A first consideration, before presenting any resolution, should be whether such a text would receive sufficient support to be adopted by the General Assembly. We all remember the 54th session of the General Assembly in 1999. A text notably calling for the establishment of moratoria and the enforcement of certain safeguards was circulated. This draft caused an immediate outcry from states that maintain the death penalty, including Egypt, India and Singapore. Strong attacks were made on the European initiative, and we were perceived as seeking to impose our values on other sovereign states. In the end, the text was withdrawn. That was the situation in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no indications that the General Assembly would be more positively inclined today towards a death penalty resolution. It would seem that while the hard-line retentionists are resigned to further Commission on Human Rights texts on this issue, they will continue to resist strongly any efforts to secure a General Assembly resolution. This would lead to further divisive debate. As a result, the European Union has decided to pursue its action against the death penalty in the Commission on Human Rights rather than the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a more fundamental issue is whether a resolution asking for a moratorium would promote the European objective of abolition of the death penalty world-wide. The presidency has suggested that the European proposal should not go as far as requesting abolition of the death penalty but rather a moratorium on the use of this punishment. Since the resolution tabled by the European Union in the Commission on Human Rights asks states to abolish the death penalty completely and, in the meantime, to establish a moratorium on executions, we may run the risk of being perceived as weakening the European stance by not suggesting the same high standards in the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also let you know that I have been approached by non-governmental organisations on this matter. In July of this year, I had the pleasure of convening a special seminar for human rights NGOs in Brussels. In the context of that meeting, the world coalition of NGOs against the death penalty, and that includes Amnesty International and many other prestigious organisations, presented its own view. The message of this group was to ask the European Union to refrain from presenting a resolution on the death penalty at the forthcoming General Assembly. These NGOs in particular pointed out that since there are no signs to the effect that political tensions have eased since 1999, such an initiative could create a highly politicised and counter-productive debate in the General Assembly. In their view, another failure in the General Assembly could reinforce the position of those states that maintain the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">I attach great importance to the expertise of the many renowned NGOs that we work with. They also play an important role as partners in the framework of projects we implement under the European initiative for democracy and human rights programme. On the initiative of this NGO coalition, we also for the first time on 10 October celebrated, if that is the right word, the World Day Against the Death Penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will continue to support campaigns designed to achieve a moratorium on the death penalty and on executions and eventually the abolition of capital punishment throughout the world. Last year approximately EUR 4.9 million were allocated under the European initiative to projects aimed at raising European public awareness in retentionist countries. The methods used include public education, out-reach to influence public opinion, studies on how states' death penalty systems comply with minimum standards, informing and supporting strategies for replacing the death penalty and efforts towards securing the access of death row inmates to appropriate levels of legal support, as well as training for lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last months there have also been some positive developments that should be highlighted. In January, Governor Ryan of Illinois decided to commute the death sentences of 156 prisoners on death row. Through the entry into force on 1 July of Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the use of the death penalty is banned not only in peacetime but also in time of war. Lastly, the President of Armenia in July commuted all outstanding death sentences to life in prison and, subsequently, in September, ratified Protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, and in that way abolished the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat, we take this issue seriously, and I am delighted that we are working with a presidency which has taken it so seriously and has pursued it with considerable skill and very good political judgment. We are making some progress, but it will take time and persistence, as well as the continuing advocacy of this Parliament if we are to attain our goal, which is to see the death penalty consigned to the history books as a form of punishment that should have no place in the modern world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union’s position is indeed clear; we are all unreservedly opposed to the death penalty, and that is why the resolution tabled jointly by this House is a relatively short one. The fundamental and primary question is what tactics we should adopt in order to make the best progress. Are we to address the UN Commission on Human Rights and demand its abolition there, or are we, in the UN General Assembly, to call only for a moratorium? Commissioner Patten set out very well how we can proceed without losing sight of our fundamental rejection of the death penalty. One might almost say that it is a bit warped: the best solution is of course the abolition of the death penalty; the second best is a moratorium; the worst of all the bad solutions is for there to be still such things as stoning to death or other even crueller modes of execution, and the second worst is to demand that people be executed ‘humanely’. So discussion of this amounts to something almost perverse.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, though, that the approach that Parliament is asking the Council to take will end up being feasible, involving as it does the European Union presenting a united front in calling, in the General Assembly, for a moratorium on the death penalty. I believe that all the states belonging to the United Nations know where the European Union stands on this. Calling now only for a moratorium will not mean that we lose sight of the overall objective. I also think it would be right for this motion to be put by the European Union as a whole. I do not think it would be right for one or other government to obstruct it and thus prevent action by the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on this subject, I would be interested to know what line our candidates for accession take on this issue. As a general rule, this should already include them. I believe that an initiative of this kind carries more weight and has more far-reaching impact if twenty-five states adopt it. As our resolution indeed mentions, the individual Member States also need, in so far as they are able, to attempt to make approaches to individual states and persuade them to support at least a moratorium. I believe that would be the best way for us to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the Presidency all the best for its negotiations towards this end. I am sure that this House will, by way of this resolution, virtually unanimously endorse this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few months ago we listened with similar discomfort to people speaking in tones of exasperation about Cuba, while on China, with its 3 138 executions in one year, we continue to pick just polite words, which are reduced at times to an embarrassed stammer when Europe is called to speak out on the increasingly frequent, at times almost industrial use of capital punishment in the United States or other so-called liberal democracies that still use the gallows, such as Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and India.</p>
<p class="contents">I should not like this political bashfulness to be compounded now by a serious omission concerning a commitment that the Presidency of the Council formally adopted before this Parliament on 2 July this year, that is, to put a resolution for a moratorium on capital punishment before the United Nations General Assembly. Let us recall – and let us remind Minister Frattini of this – that this resolution was given as one of the Italian Presidency’s priorities in its foreign policy programme, and we know – as a matter of common sense and also from experience – that a moratorium is the first political step towards the abolition of the death penalty; anything else is just a pipe-dream. The deadline for submitting a text for this resolution is 7 November, but so far there is no sign of the resolution. After many decades of noisy and sometimes sterile debate, it would be irresponsible to have announced such an important political initiative four months ago only to give in to the pressures of those who do not want the United Nations to pronounce against the death penalty. The risk of defeat? I am thinking more of the duty of battle, the duty of the political battle that the European Union must carry on its own shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as the President-in-Office of the Council leaves for China, we also entrust him with the task of reminding that country that, when faced with the value of human life, there can be no political expediency or hierarchy, not even towards China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, 31 countries breached this crucially important article, which supports what is human and alive and promotes a civilised and humane society. Thirty-one countries believed they had the right to take the lives of their own citizens. According to Amnesty International, a total of 1 526 people were executed in these 31 countries, and 3 284 people were condemned to death in 67 countries. Slightly more than 80% of the executions took place in three countries: China, Iran and the United States. Commissioner, Minister, you know all this.</p>
<p class="contents">China is the worst of them all. It is nonetheless deeply tragic to have to place the democratic United States on the same list as the two dictatorships. As a sincere friend of the United States, that pains me a great deal. How can a democratic and civilised country such as the United States continue to apply the death penalty? In the United States, the number of executions increased last year to 71, compared to 66 the year before.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not in actual fact believe, Mr President, that many Americans are aware that the United States does not fulfil the requirements for becoming a member of the EU, and I am convinced that the United States should be influenced to change its attitude. That would make it so much more difficult for other countries in the League of Death. Might the American people be less open to the facts than us Europeans? Thousands of innocent people have been condemned to death and executed. Might the American people be less humane than ourselves? No, that is not true, but, in that case, more courageous leaders are needed who wish, and dare, to take up the debate in pursuit of justice and human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it possible, Commissioner and Minister, to engage in bargaining when it comes to the total abolition of the death penalty? I doubt it. I believe that a very clear approach is required in this area. This popular revolt against the death penalty, the first step in which is a worldwide moratorium, must be supported wholeheartedly by the EU and the Italian Presidency. You must not hesitate in this area, gentlemen. The responsibility lies with yourselves, Minister and Commissioner. The death penalty must be abolished. It is not negotiable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When in 1961, abolitionists such as Martin Luther King talked about abolishing the death penalty, it appeared to be a pipe-dream. The following generation – my own – was made aware of the issue as a result of the policy conducted in this area in France, when François Mitterrand and Robert Badinter abolished the death penalty in 1981.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also bear in mind that countries we thought would never abolish the death penalty so quickly, such as Turkey and various candidate countries, have succeeded in doing so, by showing some real political will, especially since our sitting in this Chamber in June 2001. I therefore believe that, as regards this issue, instead of talking about tactics, it would be infinitely preferable to talk about political convictions and the will to back up these convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, when our fellow Member, Mr Ari Vatanen, takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally wearing a badge that features the words ‘no death penalty’, he is raising the awareness of an entire continent. By the way, as Mrs Trautmann said, what is at stake is our ability to tame our instincts for revenge.</p>
<p class="contents">When we rally forces, we manage to save a Nigerian woman who had children outside marriage from the death penalty. I believe that if we rally forces again, we will be able to get a man named Mumia Abu-Jamal off death row. He has been imprisoned only because he is black, because he was a journalist, because he spoke out for those who have no voice and because he spoke out against the abuses perpetrated by Philadelphia’s racist police.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with all of these individuals in mind that I say today we should think carefully. As regards the death penalty, the colour at stake is not black or white, but the colour of blood. This is why, in my opinion, we must not extradite people to countries where we know they can expect the death penalty. In particular, it upsets me to think about our fellow citizens currently in Guantanamo, because we do not know what their fate might be. Ladies and gentlemen, what is needed is political will, not tactics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The traditional power of sovereign rulers appears above all to be the right to make decisions about the life and property of their subjects. In an era of nation states we have failed to rid ourselves of two serious and persistent breaches of fundamental human rights, namely the death penalty and the widespread use of torture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent that the European Union, whose own external sovereignty is very weak, has, in a core area of its foreign policy, human rights, focused on the elimination of these two serious ills especially now when thoughts about armed security dominate the shaping of the new world order and at the same time violence against a country’s own citizens is worryingly becoming of relative importance. A state that kills and tortures should never have international legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fateful question the UN system has to address is the conflict I mentioned at the beginning. The universal organisation’s particular strength has indeed been considered to be respect for human rights, but at the same time its Charter is firmly anchored in the notion of state sovereignty. It thus lies at the point where two eras and two different political views of the world meet.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the time is now ripe to take this step forward and do all we can to try for a comprehensive moratorium to let the death penalty just smoulder everywhere in the world as an interim stage in eliminating it once and for all. The plan will involve diplomatic and other types of risks, but the goal will make them worth taking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In asking for a moratorium on the death penalty, at the very least, the <span class="italic">Alleanza Nazionale</span> would like to mention, merely by way of example and on the basis of the, of necessity, partial facts that were provided by Amnesty International for 2002, that, in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan alone there were 113, 48 and 40 executions respectively, not to mention the 1 060 carried out in China. In light of this, whilst upholding the urgent need for a moratorium on the death penalty, we must call, just as fervently, for the European Union and the United Nations to intervene regarding these countries in which the punishments given are not linked to secular rules but to fundamentalist cultures or traditions of any structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, whilst upholding every individual’s right to religious freedom, we need to declare with conviction that the enforcement of the <span class="italic">Sharia </span>in a State or part of it cannot be accepted by the Member States of the European Union. This is why the moratorium on the death penalty must be accompanied by sanctions that Europe must impose on those governments which do not accept the moratorium and continue to apply the death penalty with cruel techniques such as, for example, stoning to death.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the sanctions that we would like to see would be a suspension of economic relations with these countries: continuing to help the citizens, where possible, but no longer trafficking – if you will excuse the term – with those countries whose governments knowingly continue to violate human rights. Europe cannot impose its laws and its concept of democracy onto other countries, but neither can it continue to have effective economic relations with governments that are founded on the violation of the most fundamental human rights because, in these countries, the death penalty is not only a punishment inflicted by courts or carried out by the executioner but also one which is inflicted every day by hunger, desperation and violence that drive whole populations to seek refuge elsewhere and even, as has been happening in Somalia since 1991, to die in the waters of the Indian Ocean or in the Sicilian Canal. Finally, the death penalty is also a punishment that terrorists are continually giving by killing unarmed citizens. Consequently, there is no hope of actually obtaining a moratorium on the death penalty if we do not also impose sanctions on those who enforce inhumane and fundamentalist laws and cover up terrorist actions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The time is right Mr President for the Italian Presidency to press Parliament to make a symbolic gesture, to ask Iran to pardon the young woman condemned to death for killing the man who was raping her. Europe’s involvement in this could give new hope to so many women oppressed by the extremist and inhumane vision of all too many governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, I also believe we have the obligation to present such a motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Prudence cannot be allowed to make us forget our commitment to defend the right to life or our responsibility to work to increase international cooperation with a view to achieving the complete abolition of the death penalty in the world, because the death penalty is a violation of the fundamental right to life, and what is worse – as Amnesty International says – is that this violation is not only not hidden or denied, but is actually enshrined in the laws of the country which applies it. Furthermore, if a country does not respect the most fundamental of rights, with what authority will it demand from citizens respect for other rights and on what foundations will that country base its democracy and Rule of Law if its law allows the most important and most fundamental of rights to be violated: the right to life? For the European Union, therefore, the fight to abolish the death penalty and the fight for democracy and respect for human rights are and must be one and the same.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that progress has been made in this regard and that today far fewer countries maintain the death penalty in their legislation, but we are still far from its total abolition, as the statistics so cruelly demonstrate. The European Union, therefore, in order to be coherent in terms of the values on which it is founded, must make fighting the death penalty a priority, not only before the United Nations General Assembly, but also in its relations with third countries which have yet to abolish it, whatever links the Union may have with these countries or their strategic or commercial importance, because nobody must be given the power to decide on the life or death of a human being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In many speeches, I have heard a call to the Italian Presidency to present the resolution to the United Nations General Assembly, on behalf of the European Union. What I did not hear – but which I hope Parliament will be able to establish in its deliberations – was anything regarding a situation which I felt it was my duty to mention in my speech. There is not – and I repeat, there is not – unanimous agreement within the Member States of the European Union that the Italian Presidency should present a resolution on behalf of Europe. In light of this, there are two options: either Parliament asks the Council Presidency to present a document on behalf of the European Union when not all of the Members of the EU agree – and this is the first option – or it must be clearly stated that Italy, even holding the Presidency of the European Union, can present a resolution even without the consensus of some Member States – without this, however, being seen as a grave violation of the spirit of cohesion in the European Union that we must demonstrate. Italy, as a nation, is in favour of doing so, but it is in favour – and I repeat this – of doing so when it becomes totally clear that, within the framework of the European Union, not all Member States are in favour, not of a moratorium because we are all in favour of a moratorium, not of abolition, because we are all in favour of that, but of a resolution now being presented.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I believe that I have now been clearer, I will say that the Italian Presidency is not only in favour but very much in favour of presenting a resolution on behalf of Europe, but if Europe does not unite on this issue, can we present a resolution – undoubtedly not on behalf of Europe – saying that Europe is divided on this? I am ready to comply with this request when Parliament says what it thinks in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good will on the part of Europe is no longer enough. Abolishing the death penalty must be seen as a crucial aspect of the EU’s relations with third countries. Throughout the world countries continue to perpetrate this State crime. This barbaric practice still takes place in particular in Japan, China, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and in Iran, where executions are still carried out. What is worse, between 2001 and 2002, the number of executions increased. It has become impossible to remain silent about this ‘administrative murder’, especially when it is carried out by the most powerful country in the world, which is attempting to impose its order and its values on the rest of the world. We cannot accept that the only solution to crime and violence is crime and violence itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the newly created World Association of Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty and in line with the worldwide call for abolition, the European Union must exert all necessary pressure to ensure that the United Nations adopts a moratorium that would have lead rapidly to the abolition of the death penalty.</p>
