<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maštálka (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(CS) </span>Allow me first of all to thank all those who have worked very constructively with me to prepare this report on the promotion of health and safety at work. I should also like to thank all the other members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the attention they have devoted to this problem and to the materials provided. This is proof that they consider the problem of protection of health in the workplace to be an important component of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this is an area that has a direct and profound impact on all working people. To illustrate this point, I should like to list a few alarming statistics, which are also included in the report. There are a total of around five million occupational accidents every year in the EU. Around two thirds of these result in absences from work lasting longer than three days, and almost 14% of workers suffer more than one occupational injury each year. Every year about 150 million working days are lost and almost 300 000 workers allocated a certain degree of invalidity as a result of occupational injury or illness. It is estimated that the Union as a whole suffers losses of up to 3.8% of GDP as a result of illness and occupational accidents. In my view, these data demonstrate the high economic cost that results from the lack of an appropriate social policy. I should emphasise that this report deals only with the original 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be acknowledged that there are too few effective tools at European Union level that might be used to address this problem successfully. I am sure we all agree, however, that at least those tools that are available to us must be used as effectively as possible in order to improve working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, I very much welcome the fact that this draft report has been the subject of extremely detailed discussions, not only within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but also with representatives of the Commission and of non-parliamentary institutions. We have been able to clarify certain misunderstandings with regard to a number of matters; for example, that it is of course up to the Member States to adopt appropriate national legislation, to monitor the application of this legislation and to submit national reports on its implementation in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">When the text was first discussed, critical comments were made with regard to the statements relating to the Commission. In this respect, I am pleased that, at a meeting with representatives of the Commission, we were able to explain our approaches and we reached broad agreement when looking at the individual draft amendments. Following this meeting, I also made some amendments to the text of the explanatory statement, and I supported the proposal of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. As rapporteur, I have attempted to cooperate on equal terms with all the political groups within the committee, and our collaboration has resulted in many balanced compromises. These compromises were supported by all the political groups, and the report was therefore unanimously accepted during the final vote in the committee. Originally, voting on the report was to have been carried out in accordance with Rule 131. At the request of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, a closing date was set for the draft amendment, and this is why we now have the opportunity to discuss the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have again put forward four draft amendments, which have already been discussed once and put to the vote in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Allow me to make a few comments with regard to their content.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft amendment to paragraph 6 aims to delete a very important passage, which emphasises the positive role of the trade unions and employees’ organisations in the field of health and safety at work. It must be emphasised that paragraph 6, as included in the report, is the result of a compromise between all the political groups represented in the committee, including the Group of the European People’s Party. All the political groups voted for this draft in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft amendments 2, 3 and 4 are submitted in the same wording that was discussed, and eventually rejected, during the vote in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Draft amendment 4 states that a high level of worker protection would result in a weakening of the competitiveness of the original Member States if the new Member States did not fully implement rules on health and safety at work. This is hypothetical, and we must assume that all 25 Member States are obliged to observe directives, since they form part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, I am therefore against these draft amendments and I recommend that they should be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me to say a few words on the most important points contained in the text on which we are to vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Commission and the Member States are urged to make every effort to monitor and make effective improvements to the practical application of directives on health and safety at work by means of specific strategies. Attention must be paid to prevention, a multi-disciplinary approach, improved cooperation between social partners and improved compliance with and awareness of regulations on health and safety at work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Špidla,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maštálka, for the outstanding commitment and effort he has put into drafting this report. It deals with an area which is complex and which provokes much discussion, as it relates to our most important asset, namely the health and safety of employees at work. I greatly welcome this report. It was drafted after the Commission had adopted its communication on the implementation of Framework Directive 89/391/EEC and of the first five individual directives. It thus responds to the Commission’s wish that the communication should provoke genuine and broad public discussion as to how best to promote health and safety at work and how to strengthen the European framework in order to provide an environment ensuring equal opportunities for all businesses in the enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1989, Europe has adopted a number of important pieces of legislation setting out the responsibilities and obligations of employers and employees. There may only have been a small number of such pieces of legislation, but they cannot be called minimalist in any way. They have introduced a policy of integrated prevention at all levels of business, and cover all sectors of economic activity, whether private or public. Within this framework, information, education and consultation with employee participation represent the three main supporting elements of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation, ladies and gentlemen, has had a positive effect. As can be seen from the statistics, there has been a 30% drop in fatal occupational accidents. Thousands of lives have been saved. There has also been a 15% reduction in occupational accidents resulting in incapacity for work. This development is part of a long-term trend, even though it is true that the number of occupational injuries is still too high, and therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the best legislation, however, is pointless if it is not effectively applied in the workplace. It must be emphasised that the attitude of employees and employers, who are the main participants in preventive measures, is of fundamental importance. The Commission and Parliament are agreed on the need to enhance and support awareness, education and active participation by employees and employers in defining the policies for prevention at company level, and to enforce the principles laid down in this area under European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees with Parliament on the need to develop additional legislative instruments to facilitate implementation, as well as labour inspectorates armed with structures, resources and deterrent powers in order to help change attitudes, as such a change is necessary for the proper and equal enforcement of legislation in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s evaluation of the implementation of the framework directive and the first five individual directives, which was based on a thorough examination carried out in the field and on the results of assessments carried out by Commission services, points to areas where the directives are not be implemented adequately, and identifies the main problems requiring attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is delighted that Parliament agrees with the analysis carried out by the Commission, and that its report makes proposals which should improve the practical application of the legislation. The recommendations made in the report deserve full support and, together with the results of the assessment of Community strategy for the period from 2002 to 2006 and the reactions of Member States and the social partners, will form the basis for the next Community strategy, covering the period from 2007 to 2012. I should also like to thank Parliament, and especially the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for their constant efforts and on-going support for an effective policy on health and safety at work.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s adoption of this report, which includes specific recommendations for the various players, is an important step along the road to increased interest and awareness among all those involved. The Commission is grateful to Parliament and wishes to assure it that this recommendation will be taken into account as soon as deliberations begin with respect to the next strategy in the field of health and safety at work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the staggering amount of national financial expenditure has been mentioned, and it is true that national expenditure appears in the accounts. Yet although pain does not appear in them, it is no less important. Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for your efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I thank the rapporteur, Mr Maštálka, for his initiative in drafting this report and I also wish, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, to express our thanks and our satisfaction, because the Committee's main proposals are included in the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus it is emphasised that, according to recent statistics, there has been an increase in accidents in sectors employing women. That is why we call on the Commission, the Member States and the social partners to pay particular attention to this issue and to include occupational risks for women among the indicators used for monitoring health and safety at work, by which we mean the relevant research and studies carried out, statistics and accident reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We also stress that we need to combat the discrimination suffered by women in the workplace, discrimination relating to motherhood and sexual harassment, which cause working women psychological problems.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I wish, on the one hand, to point out that Community directives on health and safety at work do not cover housework or the undeclared work of helpers in companies and on farms, who are mainly women, and, on the other hand, to repeat a request by our committee: that the European Commission take initiatives in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Health and safety at work are key objectives of European policy, and so I welcome the Commission communication and Parliament’s own-initiative report, both of which reflect the principle that the practical enforcement of standards of safety at work be subject to controls and that deficiencies in national implementation be reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all the Member States have had infringement proceedings brought against them on the grounds of their failure to properly transpose the EU’s rules and regulations on health and safety at work. It is for that very reason that we must have as our main and initial objective compliance with, and monitoring of, the existing regulations even before the EU enacts new regulations and directives and imposes requirements. This is where adherence to the subsidiarity principle is a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner mentioned, responsibility for the enforcement of the health and safety at work regulations lies principally with the Member States, the regulatory bodies and the local social partners. These must be reinforced, as is indeed demanded by paragraph 12 of the report’s motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">If uniform conditions for competition are to be created, support for the new Member States is particularly important, for they have enormous potential for development. Nor is it tolerable that small and medium-sized enterprises should bear the brunt of this legislation. They create most of our new jobs and are our driving force as we journey towards Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">I have called in my Amendment 3 for the rationalisation of health and safety at work regulations, which will make them more efficient without thereby reducing the standard of protection that workers enjoy. We also need preventive strategies that can be communicated to people.</p>
<p class="contents">My Amendment 2 therefore calls for priority to be given to informing workers about preventive measures. What is most important to me is that Articles 27 and 29, which articulate generalised concerns about the proposed working time and services directives, should be deleted. They are too sweeping by far, and have nothing whatever to do with the title of the report. It is not for us to comment on other lawmaking processes or to attempt to use a non-legislative report to make legislation through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments that improve the report, changing it in such a way that it achieves its actual objective, which is the uniform implementation and monitoring of existing provisions in all the Member States, whilst avoiding the creation of new bureaucracy. I therefore ask for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Maštálka, for his work in drawing up this report on promoting health and safety at the workplace. Every year, 4.8 million people are victims of accidents at work, 5 200 people lose their lives in the workplace, and at least 158 million working days are lost. This is a great waste, of both human and economic resources. So great is the cost of the many accidents at work as to be equivalent to between 2.65% and 3.8% of the EU’s gross domestic product. This is money that could have been used instead to promote employment and create more and better jobs: a clear objective of the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to make the EU the most competitive region in the world. Businesses often complain that it is too expensive to introduce these health and safety measures, but then the cost is very great if workers die or become chronically ill as a result of accidents at work.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has already presented a number of directives on health and safety at work, and this legislation is working. According to one estimate, EU legislation has prevented the loss of 25 million European working days per annum, and many lives have already been saved, as the Commissioner, too, mentioned. Yet the common framework directive from the EU is not enough. National laws or clear collective agreements between the social partners must be introduced, just as the practical work on securing a better working environment could be greatly improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of ten new Member States to the EU presents us with a great challenge as regards the creation of a good, safe working environment in these new Member States. In many countries, the workers are not so well organised, and safety in the workplace has not been a topic for discussion. We need a greater focus on prevention and implementation, something that is also proposed in the report, and, in this connection, we need a detailed survey of the specific situation in the new Member States, too. It would be useful if the Commission were to draw up a report on this. It would also be a good idea for evaluation reports in future to focus more on evaluating the degree of practical compliance with legislation by the Member States. Otherwise, the work we are doing is worthless. We must pay special attention to the situation in small and medium-sized enterprises. There is a much larger number of accidents at work in these businesses than in large businesses, and also large numbers of workers who are poorly informed. It is very important, then, that the Commission take appropriate steps both to give a structure to the work on safety in businesses and to stimulate the social dialogue on the working environment out in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved several very good compromises. My group will support the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say in a personal capacity that it is wrong to include references to the working time and services directives in paragraphs 27 and 29, because it still has to go through the parliamentary process. While I am pleased that the reference to women and domestic work in the home in paragraph 16 has been removed to get away from gender stereotypes, which I know the rapporteur did not intend, my group has asked for a separate vote as paragraph 16 no longer makes sense as it refers both to men and women. The reference to gender mainstreaming in paragraph 14 is welcomed by my group.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we got all-party support for inclusion in paragraph 21 of a reference to injuries caused by needles and other medical sharps to health workers. I thank everybody for their support on that. This affects one million health workers across the EU. I hope that the Commission will take that on board. I should like to thank Commissioner Špidla very much for the constructive meeting we had this afternoon on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the implementation of directives has been mentioned. There is no point in bringing forward completely new health and safety legislation unless current legislation is equally implemented in all Member States. If new legislation is brought forward it has to be subject to comprehensive impact assessments based on up-to-date scientific and medical evidence. That is the only way that new health and safety legislation should be brought forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was amazed at the great scepticism evinced from the very outset with respect to this report by one of the Commission’s officials. I am glad to have heard Commissioner Špidla say today that he is fully supportive of the general line of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am baffled by the curious way in which Mrs Weisgerber submitted four retrospective amendments, and cannot understand the purpose behind her doing so. If, for example, you want to exclude trade unions from sharing responsibility for safety at work, that is an expression of a lack of desire for improvements in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The free market must take second place to the workers’ fundamental right to health, safety at work and tolerable working conditions. Here in this House, I often get the impression that growth, productivity and competitiveness are valued for their own sake and cannot be questioned under any circumstances. Human beings, whether they be EU citizens, guest workers or temporary workers, must not be reduced to being economic fundamentals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is disturbing, and indeed shocking, that a research report should be able to state that no preventive measures are in place yet for around half the workers in the EU. It is women who are at a particular disadvantage. While fewer accidents are being recorded overall, it is an unfortunate fact that more of them are occurring in sectors in which most of the workers are women.</p>
<p class="contents">The home is not even recognised as a workplace, and no account is taken of workers in family firms, who are often women. What I have to remind those who think in purely economic terms is that prevention is more humane, and also cheaper. I would ask them to be rather more careful in adding up the ultimate cost to the economy of the philosophy of maximised business profits and of the negligent approach to safety at work. More accidents, with all their consequences, cost far more than a great many preventive measures ever could. No doubt the human suffering of the accident victims and their families does not add up to much of an argument in the eyes of those who think only of their own wallets.</p>
<p class="contents">If the entrepreneurs had to pay the resultant costs themselves, this debate on safety at work would doubtless progress in a quite different way, but, as the costs of fatal accidents, incapacitation, sickness and early retirement are largely borne by the public purse, many of them have no interest in accepting precautions and controls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker spoke in Irish)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to commend my colleague, Mr Maštálka, for his report on promoting health and safety in the workplace. It is a very good, comprehensive report, and one worthy of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The health and safety of workers is paramount. The enhancement of workers' rights and entitlements can only lead to a better quality of life for workers and their families. As we have already heard, there are 4.8 million work-related accidents every year in the European Union and this is unacceptable, given that many of the injuries sustained would be avoidable with proper health and safety guidelines and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Union continues its pursuit of a successful global economy, sustained economic growth and the privatisation agenda, many people believe that workers' rights have been relegated to second place. The Commission and Member States must ensure full implementation of protection measures and it is, quite frankly, an inadequate response to tell us that implementation is insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The report indicates that a number of groups within society are particularly at risk with regard to workplace health and safety. Many women face sexual harassment, bullying, lower pay than their male counterparts, and discrimination in relation to their maternity entitlements. Many migrant workers and temporary workers face intolerably long hours and disgraceful pay at the hands of unscrupulous employers and these are the very people who require the most protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The improvement of conditions requires the universal recognition of trade unions as workers' representatives. Trade unions are an essential element in the delivery of healthy and safe workplaces and practices.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that has already been mentioned in requiring urgent attention is accidental needle stick injury, which medical professionals face every day. Due to the nature of their work they are at risk of contracting blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis. Again, these injuries are preventable through better training and safer work practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to redress the balance between the rights of business and the rights of workers because, after all, it is workers who are the backbone of any economy. We cannot afford not to have healthy and safe workplaces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Aside from general health and safety measures, persons with disabilities have their own individual requirements. Assessing and meeting the requirements of an employee with disabilities should be a matter of course and not a hassle that an employer is tempted to avoid by not hiring persons with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of teenagers working. Teenagers tend to be short-term, part-time, untrained and uninformed workers. Added to these risk factors, teenagers tend to feel indestructible; they have little thought for their health or safety. I know: I have teenagers. One of my sons worked for an employer who was very health conscious: the employer avoided the toxic jobs and gave them to the youngest workers. I had to make my son quit the job. If employers are going to use the energy, enthusiasm and cheap, unquestioning labours of young people, the least we can do is to require employers to ensure that teenage workers are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">A special school of 47 children was having a fundraiser; as a parent, I attended. It was mentioned that there was no problem getting tickets printed, as eight of the children had parents who worked in printing. I was not surprised to read scientific research later that there is a probable connection between Down's syndrome and other developmental disabilities from exposure to inks, glues, paints and other workplace-related chemicals, such as those used in a printing works.</p>
<p class="contents">Women, especially mothers, have unique health and safety issues that, when they are not addressed, are a major cause of stress. In the case of breastfeeding mothers, a lack of appropriate measures means that mothers stop breastfeeding, or do not attempt it at all. In Ireland, we have no support for breastfeeding and we have the lowest rate of breastfeeding in the EU. This is in contrast to countries like Norway, where there is good protection and good support, and where they have 98% breastfeeding rates among their mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">Research shows that the shortage of nurses, long working hours and overtime, all increase the risk of dangerous errors like needlestick injuries. There is no legislation currently governing minimum staffing levels, or any of those stress-related issues. Directive 89/391/EEC is not specific enough to protect healthcare workers. In the United States, the need for more specific legislation was recognised and the new Needlestick Injury Prevention Act now requires appropriate measures to be taken, particularly in terms of the equipment used by healthcare workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that it is vital in every discussion in the area of workers and workplace, especially in health and safety, to discuss those workers who are denied the status recognition, benefits and protection of employees. Those are the homeworkers, both men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I will focus on two types: one is the family member. In my experience, it is usually a spouse, who works on the family farm or in the family business without pay. In terms of health and safety, they may benefit from the measures that are taken for their spouse, but there are no appropriate measures taken for their own needs. I think of the daily unrecognised farm working of many of my friends, of my own sister. I can still picture her and my young teenage nephews trying to deal with a bull while her husband was at the mart: no protection there. Though their work is financially productive, they are not factored into EU directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The other group of workers, men and women home carers, are probably the largest single workforce in the EU. They work very hard and save society a fortune. They are precluded from earning because they are caring for the elderly, the sick and those with disabilities. Often that work costs them money to perform; often they are impoverished in their efforts. Their health and safety situation is critical. Home carers are commonly lifting, living on little sleep, impoverished by the cost of caring, dealing with challenging and sometimes erratic behaviour. I know, I have been one for 30 years. I urge you to bring the home workers and home carers into the employment loop with all that means, especially in protection for health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the European Parliament workers, who facilitate our work here so well. The staff who are stationed at the visitors' entrance in the LOW Building are freezing. There is a powerful heating unit over the door to warm the entrance for visitors and staff, but it has been broken all winter. I spent some time waiting there and I was frozen. I do not know how it can be healthy for the staff who must sit there all day. I have asked on a couple of occasions for the heater to be fixed and I would ask you: please, see if you can get the heater repaired for the sake of the health and safety of the staff in this building.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to have the input on health and safety regulations from the workers themselves. It could not be simpler: ask people what they need; they will tell you, and then the money spent on health and safety will be spent well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a new epidemic occurring outside our borders, Mr President, but something that is actually happening within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Accidents in the workplace are a real tragedy and have incalculable human and financial costs. I have to acknowledge that the most recent indications are that the number of accidents is falling – precisely, I believe, because of measures taken to improve the health and safety protection of workers. The figures are still worryingly high, however, and, incredible as it may seem, more than 50% of European workers still have no access to accident prevention mechanisms. Among the most vulnerable targets, temporary migrant workers deserve particular attention, as do the construction, fisheries and agriculture sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This list is not exhaustive, and I should like to underline the risks to which workers in small and medium-sized enterprises are exposed. Although they are a major driving force in Europe’s economy, SMEs suffer from a lack of information and a lack of resources in managing their health and safety problems. Without the necessary financial backing to promote worker training and awareness activities regarding the risk of accidents at work, many of the initiatives that have been considered could not even be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, an explicit reference to the key concept in this area – prevention. It is essential to increase the number, quality and competences of the workplace inspection services and to raise the penalties for failing to comply with legislation. At a time when the Lisbon objectives have just been reviewed, in the sense that a healthy, safe working environment is a decisive factor in the growth – and continued growth – of Europe’s economy, I would point out that the text of paragraphs 27 and 29 of the report we are debating does not make sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur exposes, in no uncertain terms, the inadequate and unacceptable way in which the Commission has dealt with the issue of health and safety at work over the last few years. He makes concrete and logical suggestions on how to remedy the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of having proper legislation in this field and its effective and speedy implementation is clear. The current situation is totally unsatisfactory and the human cost involved is enormous. Each year in the 25 EU Member States, approximately 400 000 workers become permanently disabled because of a workplace-related accident or disease. Each year it is estimated that about 8 000 people die as a result of work-related accidents or disease. The economic cost is equally vast. It is estimated to be about three to four per cent of GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">So why has the Commission been so complacent in dealing with this hugely important matter? Is it due to mere inadequacy and naivety? Or is it due to excessive pressure from employers, many of whom have not yet managed to comprehend the simple fact that it makes good economic sense to have high standards of health and safety at work? We expect and must insist that we get clear answers from the Commission on this issue. We also expect that the new Commissioner will do his utmost to put right the deficiencies of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two suggestions for further consideration. First, more attention should be paid not just to the health of workers in the workplace, but also to their families. Many of the toxic substances that workers are exposed to at work can be carried home, for example by way of their clothing. Second, a publicly-available blacklist of employers with proven bad records for poor hygiene and accidents should be established. Employers with the best health and safety standards should be publicly lauded and suitably rewarded. This way, consumers will be able to know who is worthy of their business support and who is not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very good that this should be so. However, I disagree completely with the last speaker, who maintained that the Commission has been complacent in this area. Far from it; I would congratulate the Commission on producing a report that has covered this important issue with a firm but light touch. The rapporteur, however, has chosen to use a somewhat heavier hand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report mentions simplified and improved benchmarking and the importance of existing legislation being evenly applied in all Member States. It points out that Belgium, France and Ireland have not yet provided any information. It also mentions the importance of developing non-legislative instruments for the protection of workers. I can agree with all of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has used the opportunity to call for further legislation and to highlight the importance of extending the powers of trade unions. I do not agree with that and hence will be supporting the amendments of my colleague, Mrs Weisgerber. Rather mischievously, the rapporteur has also used the opportunity of this health and safety report to promote, on the apparent basis of health and safety, the Atypical Workers Directive concerned with temporary agency work.</p>
<p class="contents">I also notice efforts to undermine the proposed Services Directive on the same spurious grounds. I cannot support either attempt. I understand the determination of the Left to use every possible chance to derail the Lisbon Agenda by promoting the first directive and emasculating the second, but I am sure that the Commission as a whole will not be taken in for one moment. It was a good try, though.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the rapporteur has put a lot of time and thought into this report. I agree with some of his points, but I hope he will forgive me for saying, as respectfully as I can, that I prefer the original Commission document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Working at night certainly does not do our health any good. Our efficiency at work and our success also depend on how we feel at work and how our health is cared for. In this regard it is important that legislators provide laws and regulations, that employers provide safety measures and that employees themselves are also aware of their own responsibilities and ensure that measures are observed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw particular attention to greater workplace protection for pregnant women, because in such cases two lives are endangered. It is also necessary to pay greater attention to health and safety education both at the primary level of education as well as vocational schools and colleges. Regulations cannot be effective if we are unaware of them or are not prepared to follow them.</p>
<p class="contents">The report frequently mentions new Member States, as though they have poor standards in employee health and safety. In Slovenia we have very strict regulations for safeguarding health in the workplace, and obligatory training is also regulated. Employers that are aware of the usefulness of regulations follow them closely. Unfortunately, however, this often stops at formal observance of regulations and quick profits for those that carry out training programmes. There also needs to be supervision over the implementation of regulations for the benefit of both employees and employers, because savings at the expense of workers' health are often more expensive than investment in safety, education and increasing awareness.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that there were a number of key aspects that pleased me. The first of these has already been mentioned in the debate, namely that nobody is in any doubt that health and safety at work is an important topic and, it may be said, one of the most important topics to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that nobody is in any doubt that sensible regulations are effective, and indeed the report backed this up. Even though I said that there had been a 30% drop in fatal occupational accidents, that still means a cruel loss of 2 500 human lives – approximately 2 500 human lives every year. Furthermore, it is an unfortunate fact that for every death around two people are crippled, or in other words disabled for life. This means 5 000 more human tragedies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it was also right to say that it is not entirely correct to use the concept of new and old Member States, because since 1 May neither Member States nor problems relating to health and safety at work have been bound by geographical borders, and there are many factors involved. Issues relating to particular problems in health care were also of great interest, and it is quite clear that health care is a sector beset by many difficulties and considerable risks. I also appreciate the concerns relating to those who are less able for whatever reason, and the concerns over the gender aspects of certain risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the work that has been carried out forms a good basis for the drafting of the next strategy. In this strategy, we shall have to react in a sophisticated manner and take account of new risks or newly understood risks. I am certain that we will be able to cooperate with this House to find the best way forward, so that it will be possible to record improvements in the situation in the next report. This situation, and this is again something that has been heard from all quarters, is certainly not at a level with which we can be satisfied. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
